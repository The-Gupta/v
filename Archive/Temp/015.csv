Previous described cases were solely treated with antimycotic therapy, despite guidelines recommending surgical interventions. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of C. krusei spondylitis in a patient treated with chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. After induction chemotherapy, the patient developed a candidemia, which was treated with micafungin. One month after the candidemia, the patient was admitted with severe lumbar pain. Spondylitis of the L4 and L5 vertebra was diagnosed on MR-imaging, with signs suggesting an atypical infection. The patient was treated with anidulafungin combined with voriconazole. Despite maximal conservative management symptoms gradually worsened eventually requiring surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous case reports, antimycotic treatment alone could be insufficient in treating C. krusei spondylitis.","['Overgaauw, Audrey J C', 'de Leeuw, David C', 'Stoof, Susanne P', 'van Dijk, Karin', 'Bot, Joost C J', 'Hendriks, Eef J']","['Overgaauw AJC', 'de Leeuw DC', 'Stoof SP', 'van Dijk K', 'Bot JCJ', 'Hendriks EJ']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3463-7969'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical Center, location VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. a.j.c.overgaauw@icloud.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center Amsterdam (CCA), Amsterdam University Medical Center, location VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, location VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Amsterdam University Medical Center, location VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical Center, location VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical Center, location VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20201008,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '9HLM53094I (Anidulafungin)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anidulafungin/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Candida/*drug effects', 'Candidemia/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Candidiasis/drug therapy/*immunology/microbiology/surgery', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Micafungin/therapeutic use', 'Spondylitis/*drug therapy/*immunology/microbiology/surgery', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Voriconazole/therapeutic use']",PMC7542866,['NOTNLM'],"['Candida krusei', 'Candidemia', 'Spondylitis']",2020/10/10 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/10/09 05:25'],"['2020/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/09 05:25 [entrez]', '2020/10/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-020-05451-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-020-05451-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2020 Oct 8;20(1):739. doi: 10.1186/s12879-020-05451-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The balance of these proteins has an important role in the death or life of a neuronal cell, and the functional polymorphisms in genes expressing these proteins have been found to promote apoptosis. To investigate the role of Bax and Bcl-2 genes in AD, we examined the presence of the 2 polymorphisms in peripheral blood. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical association study of these 2 functional SNPs using the peripheral blood of patients with AD. METHODS: Bax (rs4645878) and Bcl-2 (rs2279115) in Alzheimer's patients (N = 132) and healthy controls (N = 109), aged 65 to 85 years, were analyzed by qPCR (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) using TaqMan probe technology. Statistical analyses were done using SPSS, 11.5. The differences between groups were analyzed using an independent-samples t test. The relationships between genotypes and alleles were analyzed using chi-square or likelihood ratio test. The Hardy-Weinberg balance was checked for the patient and control groups. A p-value of less than 0.05 was taken as significant. RESULTS: Sporadic AD patients and non-demented age matched control subjects were genotyped in this case-control study. No statistically significant relationship was found between the patients and controls for allele or genotype frequencies (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that these two polymorphisms do not contribute to AD in the population from the Mersin region of the Eastern Mediterranean. Further studies with larger sample sizes must be conducted to ascertain the association between the 2 polymorphisms.","['Erdal, Mehmet Emin', 'Gorucu Yilmaz, Senay', 'Ay, Mustafa Ertan', 'Guler Kara, Hale', 'Avci Ozge, Aynur', 'Tasdelen, Bahar']","['Erdal ME', 'Gorucu Yilmaz S', 'Ay ME', 'Guler Kara H', 'Avci Ozge A', 'Tasdelen B']",,"['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Gaziantep University, Gaziantep, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Neurology, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Biostatistics and Information, Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Puerto Rico,P R Health Sci J,Puerto Rico health sciences journal,8303541,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer Disease/*genetics', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Female', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Male', 'Negative Results', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Turkey', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"[""*Alzheimer's disease"", '*Apoptosis', '*Bax', '*Bcl-2', '*Polymorphism']",2020/10/09 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2020/10/08 18:18'],"['2020/10/08 18:18 [entrez]', '2020/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,P R Health Sci J. 2020 Sep;39(3):264-269.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients relapsing after BCRis frequently have proliferative disease, requiring a faster time to target dose than this scheme allows. This limitation can potentially be overcome with rapid dose escalation (RDE). We analyzed 33 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients who underwent venetoclax RDE after prior BTKi treatment. Median time to target dose was 9 days. Seventeen patients (52%) developed laboratory TLS, and 5 (15%) developed clinical TLS, all as a result of renal injury. TLS was seen in more patients with a higher initial tumor burden. TLS occurred at all dose levels, with most episodes occurring at the 50- and 100-mg doses. Most interestingly, a decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) from pre-venetoclax dose to 24 hours post-venetoclax dose of 10 x 103/muL was associated with an increased risk of TLS (hazard ratio, 1.32; P = .02), after controlling for venetoclax dose level. Venetoclax RDE with close in-hospital monitoring at experienced centers and in select patients is feasible. The rapidity with which ALC drops helps predict TLS and could help guide dose-escalation decisions.","['Koenig, Kristin L', 'Huang, Ying', 'Dotson, Emily K', 'Sheredy, Shane', 'Bhat, Seema A', 'Byrd, John C', 'Desmond, Emily', 'Ford, Jill', 'Iarocci, Shauna', 'Jones, Jeffrey A', 'Lucas, Margaret S', 'Moran, Mollie E', 'Wiczer, Tracy E', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Awan, Farrukh T', 'Rogers, Kerry A']","['Koenig KL', 'Huang Y', 'Dotson EK', 'Sheredy S', 'Bhat SA', 'Byrd JC', 'Desmond E', 'Ford J', 'Iarocci S', 'Jones JA', 'Lucas MS', 'Moran ME', 'Wiczer TE', 'Woyach JA', 'Awan FT', 'Rogers KA']",,"['Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH; and.', 'Division of Hematology and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'Division of Hematology and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Sulfonamides']",PMC7556146,,,2020/10/09 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/10/08 17:14'],"['2020/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/08 17:14 [entrez]', '2020/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31218-0 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002593 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Oct 13;4(19):4860-4863. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002593.,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effective responses from health care and social services depend on appropriate identification of survivors and their families specific needs. There are few studies on survivorship in low and middle-income countries, therefore, more evidence-based studies are necessary to develop a comprehensive approach to cancer survivorship. OBJECTIVES: Identify the needs of cancer survivors and their relatives, specifically those of individuals with breast, cervical or prostate cancer, and with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: A qualitative, exploratory study conducted in two referral institutions in Brazil, located in Rio de Janeiro (Southeast region) and Fortaleza (Northeast region). The study included 47 patients of public and private health services and 12 family members. We used script-based semi-structured interviews. The discursive material obtained was categorized and analyzed using the Thematic Analysis approach. RESULTS: The analysis identified three central themes: 1) consequences of cancer treatment; 2) Changes in daily life associated with cancer survivorship; and 3) Unmet structural needs in cancer survivorship. CONCLUSION: Social and cancer control policies in Brazil should provide resources, specific care standards and clinical, psychological and social support. Cancer survivors should also receive rehabilitation and work reintegration guidelines. This matter requires broader access to qualified cancer information, development of an integrated patient-centered care and care model, and more research resources for the country's post-treatment cancer period.","['Santos, Antonio Tadeu Cheriff Dos', 'Silva, Rildo Pereira da', 'Almeida, Liz Maria de', 'Bosi, Maria Lucia Magalhaes', 'Menezes, Maria de Fatima Batalha de', 'Skaba, Marcia Marilia Vargas Froes', 'Nigenda, Gustavo', 'Arruda, Carlos Andre Moura', 'Pinheiro, Cleoneide Paulo Oliveira', 'Gonzalez-Robledo, Maria Cecilia', 'Knaul, Felicia Marie']","['Santos ATCD', 'Silva RPD', 'Almeida LM', 'Bosi MLM', 'Menezes MFB', 'Skaba MMVF', 'Nigenda G', 'Arruda CAM', 'Pinheiro CPO', 'Gonzalez-Robledo MC', 'Knaul FM']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3577-0772'],"['Population Research Division, Nucleus of Research and Qualitative Studies, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Population Research Division, Nucleus of Research and Qualitative Studies, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Division of Population Research, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Qualitative Research and Evaluation in Health, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Population Research Division, Nucleus of Research and Qualitative Studies, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Population Research Division, Nucleus of Research and Qualitative Studies, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'National School of Nursing and Obstetrics, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratory of Qualitative Research and Evaluation in Health, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Qualitative Research and Evaluation in Health, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Centro de Investigacion en Sistemas de Salud, Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Coral Gables, Florida, United States of America.', 'Institute for Advanced Study of the Americas, University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, United States of America.', 'Programa Universalidad y Competitividad en Salud, Fundacion Mexicana para la Salud, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Tomatelo a Pecho, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201008,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Brazil', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Family', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility', '*Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient-Centered Care', '*Psychosocial Support Systems', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Life/psychology', 'Self-Help Groups', '*Standard of Care', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Survivorship', 'Young Adult']",PMC7544129,,,2020/10/09 06:00,2020/11/28 06:00,['2020/10/08 17:13'],"['2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/08 17:13 [entrez]', '2020/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0239811 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-14019 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Oct 8;15(10):e0239811. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0239811. eCollection 2020.,,,"['I have read the journal policy and the author of this manuscript have the', 'following potential conflicts: FMK has been receiving research funding and', 'support through the Mexican Health Foundation since 2009 from multiple donors,', 'including pharmaceutical companies like Roche, Pfizer, Novartis, Sanofi,', 'GlaxoSmithKline Oncology and EMD Serono and travel support from Roche.

METHODS: Through a prospective cohort, 60 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were followed-up for 30 days after the hospital discharge because of chemotherapy administration, those patients were previously included in a single-blinded study in which 30 (group 1) received Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG probiotic during the administration of chemotherapy. The remaining 30 patients did not receive probiotics (group 2). There were evaluated gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal distension, meteorism, constipation, nausea, and vomit, development of infections, antibiotic use, number of emergency department visits, number of hospitalizations, and sepsis diagnosis. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: To assess the impact of the use of probiotics, the difference in proportions between both study groups was evaluated. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal manifestations (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation) occurred in 30% of patients in group 1 versus 63% of group 2 (P=0.009). Nine of 30 patients (30.0%) in group 1 went to the emergency room, versus 33.3% of group 2 (P=0.7). Antimicrobials were used in 8 subjects (26.6%) in group 1 versus 6 subjects (53.3%) in group 2 (P=0.03) suspected of an infectious disease. Four (13.3%) group 1 patients were hospitalized versus 30% of group 2 (P=0.1). Two subjects (6.6%) in group 1 had sepsis versus 7 (23.3%) in group 2 (P=0.07).Conclusions:The results indicate that the use of probiotics can be a great alternative in the improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and the adverse effects associated with chemotherapy.","['Reyna-Figueroa, Jesus', 'Bejarano-Juvera, Arely Anahi', 'Garcia-Parra, Cecilia', 'Barron-Calvillo, Elsa E', 'Queipo-Garcia, Gloria E', 'Galindo-Delgado, Patricia']","['Reyna-Figueroa J', 'Bejarano-Juvera AA', 'Garcia-Parra C', 'Barron-Calvillo EE', 'Queipo-Garcia GE', 'Galindo-Delgado P']",,"['South Central Hospital of High Specialty, Mexican Petroleum.', 'South Central Hospital of High Specialty, Mexican Petroleum.', 'South Central Hospital of High Specialty, Mexican Petroleum.', 'South Central Hospital of High Specialty, Mexican Petroleum.', 'General Hospital of Mexico Health Secretary, Mexico.', 'South Central Hospital of High Specialty, Mexican Petroleum.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Diarrhea/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/*chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Lactobacillus rhamnosus/physiology', 'Male', 'Nausea/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Probiotics/*therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vomiting/chemically induced/prevention & control']",,,,2020/10/09 06:00,2021/05/12 06:00,['2020/10/08 17:12'],"['2020/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/08 17:12 [entrez]']","['00043426-202105000-00009 [pii]', '10.1097/MPH.0000000000001956 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 May 1;43(4):e457-e461. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001956.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Here, we identify that SF3B1 mutations in mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells induce a recurrent pattern of aberrant splicing leading to activation of AKT and NF-kappaB, enhanced cell migration, and accelerated tumorigenesis. Transcriptomic analysis of human cancer specimens, MMTV-cre Sf3b1K700E/WT mice, and isogenic mutant cell lines identified hundreds of aberrant 3' splice sites (3'ss) induced by mutant SF3B1. Consistently between mouse and human tumors, mutant SF3B1 promoted aberrant splicing (dependent on aberrant branchpoints as well as pyrimidines downstream of the cryptic 3'ss) and consequent suppression of PPP2R5A and MAP3K7, critical negative regulators of AKT and NF-kappaB. Coordinate activation of NF-kappaB and AKT signaling was observed in the knockin models, leading to accelerated cell migration and tumor development in combination with mutant PIK3CA but also hypersensitizing cells to AKT kinase inhibitors. These data identify hotspot mutations in SF3B1 as an important contributor to breast tumorigenesis and reveal unique vulnerabilities in cancers harboring them.","['Liu, Bo', 'Liu, Zhaoqi', 'Chen, Sisi', 'Ki, Michelle', 'Erickson, Caroline', 'Reis-Filho, Jorge S', 'Durham, Benjamin H', 'Chang, Qing', 'de Stanchina, Elisa', 'Sun, Yiwei', 'Rabadan, Raul', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Chandarlapaty, Sarat']","['Liu B', 'Liu Z', 'Chen S', 'Ki M', 'Erickson C', 'Reis-Filho JS', 'Durham BH', 'Chang Q', 'de Stanchina E', 'Sun Y', 'Rabadan R', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Chandarlapaty S']",,"['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Key Laboratory of Genomic and Precision Medicine, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'China National Center for Bioinformation, Beijing, China.', 'Program for Mathematical Genomics.', 'Department of Systems Biology and Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Antitumor Assessment Core and Molecular Pharmacology Department, and.', 'Antitumor Assessment Core and Molecular Pharmacology Department, and.', 'Program for Mathematical Genomics.', 'Department of Systems Biology and Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Program for Mathematical Genomics.', 'Department of Systems Biology and Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Weill-Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Weill-Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Breast Medicine Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)', '0 (Sf3b1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Splicing Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC7773370,['NOTNLM'],"['*Breast cancer', '*Oncology', '*RNA processing']",2020/10/09 06:00,2021/09/08 06:00,['2020/10/08 17:12'],"['2020/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/08 17:12 [entrez]']","['138315 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI138315 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2021 Jan 4;131(1). pii: 138315. doi: 10.1172/JCI138315.,,"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA245069/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nowadays, conceptual criteria proposed by an Italian panel of experts are widely used for this purpose. How accurately these Ferrara criteria predict fitness for intensive chemotherapy is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed the fitness of adults undergoing intensive AML therapy based on Ferrara criteria and determined the accuracy of this assessment for early mortality and survival prediction. RESULTS: Among 655 adults who received curative-intent induction or reinduction chemotherapy with 7 days of standard-dose cytarabine and 3 days of an anthracycline (""7+3"") CLAG-M (cladribine, high-dose cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and mitoxantrone), or reduced-dose CLAG-M, 197 (30%) met at least one of the criteria defining unfitness for intensive chemotherapy (F-unfit). Compared with F-fit patients, the overall survival of F-unfit patients was significantly shorter (median, 4.8 months; 95% CI, 3.6 to 6.5 months v 36.8 months; 95% CI, 27.4 to 73.0 months; P < .001). When used alone, the Ferrara unfitness assessment was more accurate in predicting day 28 and day 100 mortality than the treatment-related mortality score we developed previously (used binary, </= 13.1 v > 13.1), as indicated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.76 and 0.79 versus 0.66 and 0.62. The predictive accuracy of the Ferrara unfitness assessment could be significantly improved by including additional covariates such as performance status and albumin, yielding AUCs as high as 0.84-0.85 for the prediction of day 28 or day 100 mortality. Prediction of overall survival was less accurate, yielding a c-statistic value as high as 0.75 in multivariable models. CONCLUSION: Ferrara unfitness criteria provide a good prediction tool for shorter-term mortality after intensive AML chemotherapy. Our data may serve as a benchmark for expected outcomes with intensive chemotherapy in F-fit and F-unfit patients.","['Palmieri, Raffaele', 'Othus, Megan', 'Halpern, Anna B', 'Percival, Mary-Elizabeth M', 'Godwin, Colin D', 'Becker, Pamela S', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Palmieri R', 'Othus M', 'Halpern AB', 'Percival MM', 'Godwin CD', 'Becker PS', 'Walter RB']",,"['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine & Pathology & Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201008,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Consensus', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC8462659,,,2020/10/09 06:00,2021/03/25 06:00,['2020/10/08 17:11'],"['2020/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/08 17:11 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.20.01392 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 Dec 10;38(35):4163-4174. doi: 10.1200/JCO.20.01392.

Objective: To summarize the evidence on the efficacy and adverse effects of antifungal agents using an integrated comparison. Data Sources: Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials were searched to collect all relevant evidence published in randomized clinical trials that assessed antifungal prophylaxis in patients with hematological disease. Sources were search from inception up to October 2019. Study Selection: Studies that compared any antifungal agent with a placebo, no antifungal agent, or another antifungal agent among patients with hematological disease or undergoing HSCT were included. Of 39709 studies identified, 69 met the criteria for inclusion. Data Extraction and Synthesis: The outcome from each study was estimated using the relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs. The Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model was used. The reliability and validity of the networks were estimated by addressing inconsistencies in the evidence from comparative studies of different treatments. Data were analyzed from December 2019 to February 2020. Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for Network Meta-analysis (PRISMA-NMA) guideline. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were invasive fungal infections (IFIs) and mortality. The secondary outcomes were fungal infections, proven IFIs, invasive candidiasis, invasive aspergillosis, fungi-related death, and withdrawal owing to adverse effects of the drug. Results: We identified 69 randomized clinical trials that reported comparisons of 12 treatments with at total of 14789 patients. Posaconazole was the treatment associated with the best probability of success against IFIs (surface under the cumulative ranking curve, 86.7%; mean rank, 2.5). Posaconazole treatment was associated with a significant reduction in IFIs (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42-0.79) and invasive aspergillosis (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15-0.85) compared with placebo. Voriconazole was associated with a significant reduction in invasive candidiasis (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.26) compared with placebo. However, posaconazole was associated with a higher incidence of withdrawal because of the adverse effects of the drug (surface under the cumulative ranking curve, 17.5%; mean rank, 9.2). In subgroup analyses considering efficacy and tolerance, voriconazole might be the best choice for patients undergoing HSCT, especially allogenic HSCT; however, posaconazole was ranked as the best choice for patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that voriconazole may be the best prophylaxis option for patients undergoing HSCT, and posaconazole may be the best prophylaxis option for patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Wang, Jing', 'Zhou, Min', 'Xu, Jing-Yan', 'Zhou, Rong-Fu', 'Chen, Bing', 'Wan, Yuan']","['Wang J', 'Zhou M', 'Xu JY', 'Zhou RF', 'Chen B', 'Wan Y']",,"['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China.', 'The Pq Laboratory of Micro/Nano BiomeDx, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Binghamton University - SUNY, Binghamton, New York.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China.', 'The Pq Laboratory of Micro/Nano BiomeDx, Department of Biomedical Engineering, Binghamton University - SUNY, Binghamton, New York.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20201001,United States,JAMA Netw Open,JAMA network open,101729235,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control', 'Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis/*methods', 'Triazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Voriconazole/*administration & dosage']",PMC7545296,,,2020/10/09 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/10/08 12:22'],"['2020/10/08 12:22 [entrez]', '2020/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['2771516 [pii]', '10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.17652 [doi]']",epublish,JAMA Netw Open. 2020 Oct 1;3(10):e2017652. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.17652.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), determining the association of MRD with survival may improve prognostication and inform selection of efficient clinical trial end points. Objective: To examine the association between MRD status and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with AML using scientific literature. Data Sources: Clinical studies on AML published between January 1, 2000, and October 1, 2018, were identified via searches of PubMed, Embase, and MEDLINE. Study Selection: Literature search and study screening were performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Studies that assessed DFS or OS by MRD status in patients with AML were included. Reviews, non-English-language articles, and studies reporting only outcomes after hematopoietic cell transplantation or those with insufficient description of MRD information were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Study sample size, median patient age, median follow-up time, MRD detection method, MRD assessment time points, AML subtype, specimen source, and survival outcomes were extracted. Meta-analyses were performed separately for DFS and OS using bayesian hierarchical modeling. Main Outcomes and Measures: Meta-analyses of survival probabilities and hazard ratios (HRs) were conducted for OS and DFS according to MRD status. Results: Eighty-one publications reporting on 11151 patients were included. The average HR for achieving MRD negativity was 0.36 (95% bayesian credible interval [CrI], 0.33-0.39) for OS and 0.37 (95% CrI, 0.34-0.40) for DFS. The estimated 5-year DFS was 64% for patients without MRD and 25% for those with MRD, and the estimated OS was 68% for patients without MRD and 34% for those with MRD. The association of MRD negativity with DFS and OS was significant for all subgroups, with the exception of MRD assessed by cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that achievement of MRD negativity is associated with superior DFS and OS in patients with AML. The value of MRD negativity appears to be consistent across age groups, AML subtypes, time of MRD assessment, specimen source, and MRD detection methods. These results support MRD status as an end point that may allow for accelerated evaluation of novel therapies in AML.","['Short, Nicholas J', 'Zhou, Shouhao', 'Fu, Chenqi', 'Berry, Donald A', 'Walter, Roland B', 'Freeman, Sylvie D', 'Hourigan, Christopher S', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Nogueras Gonzalez, Graciela', 'Hwang, Hyunsoo', 'Qi, Xinyue', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Short NJ', 'Zhou S', 'Fu C', 'Berry DA', 'Walter RB', 'Freeman SD', 'Hourigan CS', 'Huang X', 'Nogueras Gonzalez G', 'Hwang H', 'Qi X', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ravandi F']",,"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Institute of Infection and Immunity, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,,IM,,PMC7545346,,,2020/10/09 06:00,2020/10/09 06:00,['2020/10/08 12:22'],"['2020/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/08 12:22 [entrez]']","['2771199 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.4600 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2020 Dec 1;6(12):1890-1899. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.4600.,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR003167/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 2016 WHO classification is not specific regarding sub-classification of CML with <10% abnormal B-lymphoid blasts (ABLB), and suggests these patients often show rapid progression. We report the clinical course of pediatric CML-CP patients who had detectable abnormal blasts by flow-cytometry at baseline. METHODS: Retrospective audit of all pediatric CML patients between January 2013 and December 2017 were included. Their clinical presentation, demographic profile, and treatment outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records. Some of these patients got flow-cytometry done by default, though it was not a routine part of diagnostic CML marrow studies. RESULTS: Amongst 65 pediatric CML patients, flow-cytometry at initial diagnosis was available in 15 (CP-12; AP-3). Of the 12 CML-CP patients, 10 (83%) had abnormal flow-cytometric findings-5 (50%) with mixed lineage blasts (4-B/Myeloid, 1-B/T/Myeloid), and myeloid lineage blasts in the remaining 5 (50%). At a median follow-up of 26 months (range: 9-34 months), 3/5 patients with ABLB at diagnosis progressed to frank blast crisis (2 B-cell; 1 Mixed lineage). None among the five patients with diagnostic myeloid-alone aberrant blasts progressed to blast crisis. Imatinib resistant mutation was also found in 3/5 (60%) CML-CP patients with these ABLB at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Although a retrospective study with limited sample size, presence of ABLB detected on flow-cytometry in CML-CP patients, had a noticeable early conversion to CML-BC in our cohort. Incorporation of flow-cytometry in diagnostic work-up can provide useful insight regarding the behavior of pediatric CML-CP patients and guide therapy.","['Vijayasekharan, Kalasekhar', 'Chatterjee, Gaurav', 'Ramanathan, Subramaniam', 'Narula, Gaurav', 'Tembhare, Prashant', 'Subramanian, Papagudi G', 'Patkar, Nikhil', 'Gujral, Sumeet', 'Shetty, Dhanlaxmi', 'Banavali, Shripad']","['Vijayasekharan K', 'Chatterjee G', 'Ramanathan S', 'Narula G', 'Tembhare P', 'Subramanian PG', 'Patkar N', 'Gujral S', 'Shetty D', 'Banavali S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3796-8782', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6505-7898', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8539-295X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9030-0415', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9107-5937', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9234-2857', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2083-3176', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4069-023X']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), Manipal, Karnataka, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Center - ACTREC, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Center - ACTREC, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Center - ACTREC, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Center - ACTREC, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Center - ACTREC, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Center - ACTREC, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201008,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Monoclonal type-I cryoglobulinaemia is the least frequent and is associated to hematological diseases such as multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphoma. We describe the case of a 60-year-old female patient, who suffered from burning pain in her feet for ten months before her admission. The patient presented intermittent distal cyanosis that progressed to digital ischaemia. She also reported paresthesia in her hands, difficulty in writing, and a 26-kg-weight loss. At the physical examination, it was identified livedo reticularis, palpable purpura, and painful ecchymotic lesions in her calves and feet. Moreover, peripheral pulses were palpable and symmetrical. It was observed an atrophy of the right first dorsal interosseous and both extensor digitorum brevis, as well as a distal bilateral apalesthesia and allodynia. Both Achilles reflexes were absent. Laboratory tests revealed anemia, high erythrosedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Serum protein electrophoresis showed a monoclonal IgG-Kappa gammopathy. The results also evidenced the presence of Bence-Jones proteinuria. The bone marrow biopsy revealed less than 10% of plasma cells, and skin biopsy informed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The patient was treated with high-dose intravenous steroids and cyclophosphamide. The treatment showed that the skin lesions had improved, pain disappeared and motor deficit stopped its progression.","['Duarte, Juan Manuel', 'Ocampo, Paloma', 'Ramos, Silvia Graciela', 'Carballo, Orlando Gabriel', 'Barcia, Ricardo E', 'Arevalo, Cecilia Elena']","['Duarte JM', 'Ocampo P', 'Ramos SG', 'Carballo OG', 'Barcia RE', 'Arevalo CE']",,"['Sexta Catedra de Medicina Interna, Hospital de Clinicas ""Jose de San Martin"", Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina. jduarte@hospitalaleman.com.', 'Sexta Catedra de Medicina Interna, Hospital de Clinicas ""Jose de San Martin"", Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia, Unidad de Inmunologia e Histocompatibilidad, Hospital Carlos G.

We compared the feeder cell growth rates; secretion of growth factors including stem cell factor (SCF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF); the effects of growth factors on porcine PGC growth; and EG growth rates when individual cells were used as feeders. Our results showed that feeder cells secreted limited amounts of growth factors, and supplementation of growth factors can significantly improve the formation of EG colonies and number of passages (P < 0.05).

Boswellia dalzielii is a well-known herb that is traditionally used for treatment and management of many diseases including degenerative diseases. In this study, silver nanoparticles were synthesized from the phytochemicals of B. dalzielii stem bark aqueous extract. The silver nanoparticles were characterized by carrying out Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Energy Filtered Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction, and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analyses. Antioxidant capacity of the nanoparticles was evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, and the antiproliferative effect of the nanoparticles on Kasumi-1 leukemia cells was investigated using PrestoBlue assay. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to observe the effect of the nanoparticles on the leukemia cell cycle progression. Results: Our findings revealed that the synthesized silver nanoparticles were formed from electrons of the plant phytochemicals which include aromatic compounds, ethers, and alkynes. FESEM analysis revealed that the sizes of the nanoparticles range from 12 nm to 101 nm; however, DLS analysis estimated a larger average size of the nanoparticles (108.3 nm) because it measured the hydrodynamic radii of the nanoparticles. The zeta potential of the nanoparticles was -16 nm, and the XRD pattern of the nanoparticles has distinct peaks at 38.02 degrees , 42.94 degrees , 64.45 degrees , 77.20 degrees , and 81.47 degrees , which is typical of face-centered cubic (fcc) structure of silver. The Trolox Equivalence Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of the nanoparticles was estimated to be 300.91 muM Trolox/mg silver nanoparticles. The nanoparticles inhibited Kasumi-1 cell proliferation. The half minimal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) that inhibited Kasumi-1 cell proliferation are 49.5 mug/ml and 13.25 mug/ml at 48 and 72 hours, respectively. The nanoparticles induced cell cycle arrest in the Kasumi-1 cells at S (5% increase) and G2/M (3% increase) phases. Conclusion: The nanoparticles synthesized from the stem bark extract of B. dalzielii inhibit the growth of Kasumi-1 leukemia cells by activating cell cycle arrest; thus, they are potential antileukemic agents.","['Adebayo, Ismail Abiola', 'Usman, Adamu Ibrahim', 'Shittu, Fatimah Bukola', 'Ismail, Noor Zafirah', 'Arsad, Hasni', 'Muftaudeen, Taoheed Kolawole', 'Samian, Mohammed Razip']","['Adebayo IA', 'Usman AI', 'Shittu FB', 'Ismail NZ', 'Arsad H', 'Muftaudeen TK', 'Samian MR']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4891-5950', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3188-8052']","['Integrative Medicine Cluster, Advanced Medical and Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 13200 Bertam, Kepala Batas, Penang, Malaysia.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Kampala International University, Western Campus, P.O.

Similar to cisplatin, PdPyTT produced a time- and dose-dependent decrease in cell viability. Additionally, the palladium complex increased both the proportion of cells with apoptotic morphology and the activation of caspase-3 and -9.

Many of the ~20 million HTLV-1 infected people will develop severe leukaemia or an ALS-like motor disease, unless a therapy becomes available. A key step in the establishment of infection is the integration of viral genetic material into the host genome, catalysed by the retroviral integrase (IN) enzyme. Here, we use X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of the functional deltaretroviral IN assembled on viral DNA ends and bound to the B56gamma subunit of its human host factor, protein phosphatase 2 A. The structure reveals a tetrameric IN assembly bound to two molecules of the phosphatase via a conserved short linear motif.

In the present study, we demonstrate that leukemic cells residing in the liver display unique biological properties and also contribute to systemic changes that influence physiologic responses to chemotherapy. Specifically, the liver microenvironment induces metabolic adaptations via upregulating expression of endothelial lipase in leukemia cells, which not only stimulates tumor cell proliferation through polyunsaturated fatty acid-mediated pathways, but also promotes survival by stabilizing antiapoptotic proteins. Additionally, hepatic infiltration and tissue damage caused by malignant cells induces release of liver-derived enzymes capable of degrading chemotherapy drugs, an event that further protects leukemia cells from conventional therapies. Together, these studies demonstrate a unique role for liver in modulating the pathogenesis of leukemic disease and suggest that the hepatic microenvironment may protect leukemia cells from chemotherapeutic challenge. SIGNIFICANCE: The studies presented herein demonstrate that the liver provides a microenvironment in which leukemia cells acquire unique metabolic properties. The adaptations that occur in the liver confer increased resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, we propose that therapies designed to overcome liver-specific metabolic changes will yield improved outcomes for patients with leukemia.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 211.","['Ye, Haobin', 'Minhajuddin, Mohammad', 'Krug, Anna', 'Pei, Shanshan', 'Chou, Chih-Hsing', 'Culp-Hill, Rachel', 'Ponder, Jessica', 'De Bloois, Erik', 'Schniedewind, Bjorn', 'Amaya, Maria L', 'Inguva, Anagha', 'Stevens, Brett M', 'Pollyea, Daniel A', 'Christians, Uwe', 'Grimes, H Leighton', ""D'Alessandro, Angelo"", 'Jordan, Craig T']","['Ye H', 'Minhajuddin M', 'Krug A', 'Pei S', 'Chou CH', 'Culp-Hill R', 'Ponder J', 'De Bloois E', 'Schniedewind B', 'Amaya ML', 'Inguva A', 'Stevens BM', 'Pollyea DA', 'Christians U', 'Grimes HL', ""D'Alessandro A"", 'Jordan CT']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6519-4860', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8162-6758', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2258-6490', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0869-3465']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado. craig.jordan@cuanschutz.edu haobin.ye@cuanschutz.edu.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', ""Division of Immunobiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, Ohio."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', ""Division of Immunobiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinnati, Ohio."", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado. craig.jordan@cuanschutz.edu haobin.ye@cuanschutz.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201007,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,"['EC 3.1.1.3 (LIPG protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.1.3 (Lipase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lipase/*metabolism', 'Liver/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC7858222,,,2020/10/09 06:00,2022/01/15 06:00,['2020/10/08 05:26'],"['2020/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/08 05:26 [entrez]']","['2159-8290.CD-20-0318 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-0318 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2021 Feb;11(2):500-519. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-20-0318.

Unfortunately, tumor cells acquire PARPi resistance, which is usually associated with the restoration of homologous recombination, loss of PARP1 expression, and/or loss of DNA double-strand break (DSB) end resection regulation. Here, we identify a constitutive mechanism of resistance to PARPi. We report that the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) facilitates DSB repair activity in leukemia cells to protect them against PARPi-mediated synthetic lethality. This effect depends on the hypoxia-induced overexpression of transforming growth factor beta receptor (TGFbetaR) kinase on malignant cells, which is activated by bone marrow stromal cells-derived transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1). Genetic and/or pharmacological targeting of the TGF-beta1-TGFbetaR kinase axis results in the restoration of the sensitivity of malignant cells to PARPi in BMM and prolongs the survival of leukemia-bearing mice. Our finding may lead to the therapeutic application of the TGFbetaR inhibitor in patients receiving PARPis.","['Le, Bac Viet', 'Podszywalow-Bartnicka, Paulina', 'Maifrede, Silvia', 'Sullivan-Reed, Katherine', 'Nieborowska-Skorska, Margaret', 'Golovine, Konstantin', 'Yao, Juo-Chin', 'Nejati, Reza', 'Cai, Kathy Q', 'Caruso, Lisa Beatrice', 'Swatler, Julian', 'Dabrowski, Michal', 'Lian, Zhaorui', 'Valent, Peter', 'Paietta, Elisabeth M', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Fernandez, Hugo F', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Huang, Jian', 'Challen, Grant A', 'Link, Daniel', 'Tempera, Italo', 'Wasik, Mariusz A', 'Piwocka, Katarzyna', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Le BV', 'Podszywalow-Bartnicka P', 'Maifrede S', 'Sullivan-Reed K', 'Nieborowska-Skorska M', 'Golovine K', 'Yao JC', 'Nejati R', 'Cai KQ', 'Caruso LB', 'Swatler J', 'Dabrowski M', 'Lian Z', 'Valent P', 'Paietta EM', 'Levine RL', 'Fernandez HF', 'Tallman MS', 'Litzow MR', 'Huang J', 'Challen GA', 'Link D', 'Tempera I', 'Wasik MA', 'Piwocka K', 'Skorski T']",,"['Sol Sherry Thrombosis Research Center and Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA; Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Laboratory of Cytometry, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Laboratory of Cytometry, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Sol Sherry Thrombosis Research Center and Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Sol Sherry Thrombosis Research Center and Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Sol Sherry Thrombosis Research Center and Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Sol Sherry Thrombosis Research Center and Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Laboratory of Cytometry, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Laboratory of Bioinformatics, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna and Ludwig-Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Vienna, Austria.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine-Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Moffitt Malignant Hematology & Cellular Therapy at Memorial Healthcare System, Pembroke Pines, FL, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Laboratory of Cytometry, Warsaw, Poland.

Dysregulation of apoptotic cell death pathways is a leading cause of drug resistance; thus, alternative cell death mechanisms, such as necroptosis, represent an appealing target for the treatment of high-risk malignancies. We and other investigators have shown that activation of receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1)-dependent apoptosis and necroptosis by second mitochondria derived activator of caspase mimetics (SMs) is an attractive antileukemic strategy not currently exploited by standard chemotherapy. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that determine sensitivity to SMs have remained elusive. We show that tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) messenger RNA expression correlates with sensitivity to SMs in primary human leukemia. Functional genetic experiments using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 demonstrate that TNFR2 and TNFR1, but not the ligand TNF-alpha, are essential for the response to SMs, revealing a ligand-independent interplay between TNFR1 and TNFR2 in the induction of RIP1-dependent cell death. Further potential TNFR ligands, such as lymphotoxins, were not required for SM sensitivity. Instead, TNFR2 promotes the formation of a RIP1/TNFR1-containing death signaling complex that induces RIP1 phosphorylation and RIP1-dependent apoptosis and necroptosis. Our data reveal an alternative paradigm for TNFR2 function in cell death signaling and provide a rationale to develop strategies for the identification of leukemias with vulnerability to RIP1-dependent cell death for tailored therapeutic interventions.","['Aguade-Gorgorio, Julia', 'McComb, Scott', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Guinot, Anna', 'Marovca, Blerim', 'Mezzatesta, Caterina', 'Jenni, Silvia', 'Abduli, Liridon', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Dobay, Maria Pamela', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre', 'Bornhauser, Beat C']","['Aguade-Gorgorio J', 'McComb S', 'Eckert C', 'Guinot A', 'Marovca B', 'Mezzatesta C', 'Jenni S', 'Abduli L', 'Schrappe M', 'Dobay MP', 'Stanulla M', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Cario G', 'Bourquin JP', 'Bornhauser BC']",,"[""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Medical University Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Department of General Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany; and.', ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Medical University Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of General Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany; and.', ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (AGFG1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Caspases', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics', 'Necrosis', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', '*Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II/genetics']",PMC7556136,,,2020/10/08 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/10/07 17:14'],"['2019/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/07 17:14 [entrez]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31214-3 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000796 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Oct 13;4(19):4823-4833. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000796.,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OS was 65 months for patients who underwent autologous HSCT; 18 months and 14 months, respectively, for those treated with AL-like and NHL-like regimens without consolidation; and 4 months for those receiving palliative care (P < .001). In BPDCN, chemotherapy with lymphoma- or AL-like regimens, followed by transplantation, represents the therapeutic strategy associated with the best outcome. Consolidation with allogeneic HSCT, when feasible, appears superior to autologous HSCT.","['Laribi, Kamel', 'Baugier de Materre, Alix', 'Sobh, Mohamad', 'Cerroni, Lorenzo', 'Valentini, Caterina Giovanna', 'Aoki, Tomohiro', 'Suzuki, Ritsuro', 'Takeuchi, Kengo', 'Frankel, Arthur E', 'Cota, Carlo', 'Ghez, David', 'Le Calloch, Ronan', 'Pagano, Livio', 'Petrella, Tony']","['Laribi K', 'Baugier de Materre A', 'Sobh M', 'Cerroni L', 'Valentini CG', 'Aoki T', 'Suzuki R', 'Takeuchi K', 'Frankel AE', 'Cota C', 'Ghez D', 'Le Calloch R', 'Pagano L', 'Petrella T']",,"['Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Le Mans, Le Mans, France.', 'Geriatric Department, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Broca, Paris, France.', 'Hematology, BMT Program, The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

DATA SOURCE: This is a systematic review, carried out in PubMed/ Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO), Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (BIREME), and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). We selected studies that included children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer (solid or hematologic) and submitted to exercise protocols during hospitalization. Studies involving patients with other pathologies or with a medical contraindication for exercise were excluded. We used the following search strategy: Neoplasm OR Leukemia OR Cancer OR Tumor OR Medical Oncology AND Hospitalization OR Inpatient Care Units OR Intrahospital AND Exercise. The methodological quality of the studies was analyzed by the PEDro scale. DATA SYNTHESIS: Among the 626 articles found, only 9 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, obtaining a regular methodological quality. The samples had 172 participants, aged 4 to 18 years. Only 6 studies presented both intervention group and control group. The intervention group received strength, aerobic, and muscle stretching exercises, and games, among others. The control group received the standard treatment. The studies varied regarding time, frequency, intensity, and type of exercise. Most studies showed an increase in muscle strength (4/5), followed by an improvement in physical fitness (2/3) and functional capacity (2/4). No adverse events were reported during the interventions. The methodological quality was considered regular. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that. during hospitalization of children and adolescents with cancer, exercise improves muscle strength, physical fitness, and functionality.","['Santos, Scarlat da Silva', 'Moussalle, Luciane Dalcanale', 'Heinzmann-Filho, Joao Paulo']","['Santos SDS', 'Moussalle LD', 'Heinzmann-Filho JP']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2024-630X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3699-6722', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8426-0250']","['Centro Universitario Cenecista de Osorio, Osorio, RS, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Ciencias da Saude de Porto Alegre , Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Centro Universitario Cenecista de Osorio, Osorio, RS, Brazil.']","['eng', 'por']","['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20201005,Brazil,Rev Paul Pediatr,Revista paulista de pediatria : orgao oficial da Sociedade de Pediatria de Sao Paulo,9109353,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy/*methods', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Muscle Strength/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/therapy', '*Physical Functional Performance']",PMC7537404,,,2020/10/08 06:00,2021/07/16 06:00,['2020/10/07 17:13'],"['2019/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/07 17:13 [entrez]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0103-05822021000100504 [pii]', '10.1590/1984-0462/2021/39/2019313 [doi]']",epublish,Rev Paul Pediatr. 2020 Oct 5;39:e2019313. doi: 10.1590/1984-0462/2021/39/2019313. eCollection 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Durability of progression-free survival (PFS) with ibrutinib can vary by patient subgroup. Clinical tools for prognostication and risk-stratification are needed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients treated with ibrutinib in phase II and III trials provided the discovery data set and were subdivided into discovery and internal validation cohorts. An external validation cohort included 84 patients enrolled in our investigator-initiated phase II trial. Univariable analysis of 18 pretreatment parameters was performed using PFS and overall survival (OS) end-points. Multivariable analysis and machine-learning algorithms identified four factors for a prognostic model that was validated in internal and external cohorts. RESULTS: Factors independently associated with inferior PFS and OS were as follows: TP53 aberration, prior treatment, beta-2 microglobulin >/= 5 mg/L, and lactate dehydrogenase > 250 U/L. Each of these four factors contributed one point to a prognostic model that stratified patients into three risk groups: three to four points, high risk; two points, intermediate risk; zero to one point, low risk. The 3-year PFS rates for all 804 patients combined were 47%, 74%, and 87% for the high-, the intermediate-, and the low-risk group, respectively (P < .0001). The 3-year OS rates were 63%, 83%, and 93%, respectively (P < .0001). The model remained significant when applied to treatment-naive and relapsed/refractory cohorts individually. For 84 patients in the external cohort, BTK and PLCG2 mutations were tested cross-sectionally and at progression. The cumulative incidences of mutations were strongly correlated with the model. In the external cohort, Richter's transformation occurred in 17% of the high-risk group, and in no patient in the low-risk group. CONCLUSION: Patients at increased risk of ibrutinib failure can be identified at treatment initiation and considered for clinical trials.","['Ahn, Inhye E', 'Tian, Xin', 'Ipe, David', 'Cheng, Mei', 'Albitar, Maher', 'Tsao, L Claire', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Ma, Wanlong', 'Herman, Sarah E M', 'Gaglione, Erika M', 'Soto, Susan', 'Dean, James P', 'Wiestner, Adrian']","['Ahn IE', 'Tian X', 'Ipe D', 'Cheng M', 'Albitar M', 'Tsao LC', 'Zhang L', 'Ma W', 'Herman SEM', 'Gaglione EM', 'Soto S', 'Dean JP', 'Wiestner A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3717-287X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1896-2462', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4831-3105']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Office of Biostatistics Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'NeoGenomics Laboratories, Irvine, CA.', 'Genomic Testing Cooperative, Irvine, CA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'NeoGenomics Laboratories, Irvine, CA.', 'Genomic Testing Cooperative, Irvine, CA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201007,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Piperidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC8189626,,,2020/10/08 06:00,2021/09/16 06:00,['2020/10/07 17:10'],"['2022/02/20 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/07 17:10 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.20.00979 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2021 Feb 20;39(6):576-585. doi: 10.1200/JCO.20.00979.

The overexpression of eIF4E in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is related to cancer cell growth and survival. Thus, the inhibition of MNKs and eIF4E phosphorylation are potential therapeutic strategies for AML. Herein, a structure-based virtual screening approach was performed to identify potential MNK inhibitors from natural products. Three flavonoids, apigenin, hispidulin, and luteolin, showed MNK2 inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 308, 252, and 579 nM, respectively. A structure-activity relationship analysis was performed to disclose the molecular interactions. Furthermore, luteolin exhibited substantial inhibitory efficacy against MNK1 (IC50 = 179 nM). Experimental results from cellular assays showed that hispidulin and luteolin inhibited the growth of MOLM-13 and MV4-11 AML cells by downregulating eIF4E phosphorylation and arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. Therefore, hispidulin and luteolin showed promising results as lead compounds for the potential treatment for AML.","['Chen, Liang-Chieh', 'Huang, Han-Li', 'HuangFu, Wei-Chun', 'Yen, Shih-Chung', 'Ngo, Sin-Ting', 'Wu, Yi-Wen', 'Lin, Tony Eight', 'Sung, Tzu-Ying', 'Lien, Ssu-Ting', 'Tseng, Hui-Ju', 'Pan, Shiow-Lin', 'Huang, Wei-Jan', 'Hsu, Kai-Cheng']","['Chen LC', 'Huang HL', 'HuangFu WC', 'Yen SC', 'Ngo ST', 'Wu YW', 'Lin TE', 'Sung TY', 'Lien ST', 'Tseng HJ', 'Pan SL', 'Huang WJ', 'Hsu KC']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4891-3848', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9022-6673']","[""Warshel Institute for Computational Biology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program in Biotechnology Research and Development, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Biomedical Commercialization Center, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program in Biotechnology Research and Development, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program for Cancer Molecular Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', ""Warshel Institute for Computational Biology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), Shenzhen, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", 'Ph.D. Program in Biotechnology Research and Development, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program for Cancer Molecular Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program for Cancer Molecular Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, College of Biological Science and Technology, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program in Biotechnology Research and Development, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program in Biotechnology Research and Development, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Biomedical Commercialization Center, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program for Cancer Molecular Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program in Biotechnology Research and Development, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program for the Clinical Drug Discovery from Botanical Herbs, College of Pharmacy, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program in Biotechnology Research and Development, College of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Biomedical Commercialization Center, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Ph.D. Program for Cancer Molecular Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201007,United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MKNK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Flavonoids', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,,2020/10/08 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2020/10/07 17:10'],"['2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/07 17:10 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c00516 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2020 Oct 23;83(10):2967-2975. doi: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c00516.

METHODS: Search for published articles about the association between the rs3751143 and CLL in PubMed, MEDINE, Web of Science, and Embase databases, with a calculated odds ratio of (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS: A total of 1184 cases and 1725 controls in 8 studies were pooled together for evaluation of the overall association between rs3751143 and risk of CLL. Allele model (A vs C, p = 0.16, OR = 0.85, 95%CI = 0.71-1.17), homozygous model (AA vs CC, p = 0.07; OR = 0.78, 95%CI = 0.84-1.08), and heterozygous model (AC vs CC, p = 0.76; OR = 0.85; 95%CI = 0.68-0.79) did not show decreased risk of developing CLL. Similarly, dominant model (AA + AC vs. CC: p = 0.58; OR = 1.10, 95%CI = 0.69-1.75), and recessive model (AA vs AC + CC, p = 0.21, OR = 1.18, 95%CI = 0.70-1.99) failed to show decreased risk of developing CLL. However, in familial, heterozygous model (AC vs. CC: p = 0.0006, OR = 0.64, 95%CI = 0.67-1.50) and recessive model (AA vs. AC + CC: p = 0.0017; OR = 1.02, 95%CI = 0.73-2.35) indicated the association between the inheritance of rs3751143 and the risk of developing CLL. In the overall survival prognosis, no significant association between rs3751143 and CLL was detected with relatively high heterogeneity.

DESIGN/METHODS: Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) Protocols 05-001 and 11-001 enrolled pediatric patients with newly diagnosed B- or T-ALL from 2005 to 2011 and from 2012 to 2015, respectively. Protocol therapy was nearly identical for patients with T-ALL (N = 123), who were all initially assigned to the high-risk arm. End-induction minimal residual disease (MRD) was assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or next-generation sequencing (NGS), but was not used to modify postinduction therapy. Early T-cell precursor (ETP) status was determined by flow cytometry. Cases with sufficient diagnostic DNA were retrospectively evaluated by targeted NGS of known genetic drivers of T-ALL, including Notch, PI3K, and Ras pathway genes. RESULTS: The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with T-ALL was 81% (95% CI, 73-87%) and 90% (95% CI, 83-94%), respectively. ETP phenotype was associated with failure to achieve complete remission, but not with inferior OS. Low end-induction MRD (<10(-4) ) was associated with superior disease-free survival (DFS). Pathogenic mutations of the PI3K pathway were mutually exclusive of ETP phenotype and were associated with inferior 5-year DFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings demonstrate that ETP phenotype, end-induction MRD, and PI3K pathway mutation status are prognostically relevant in pediatric T-ALL and should be considered for risk classification in future trials. DFCI Protocols 05-001 and 11-001 are registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00165087 and NCT01574274, respectively.","['Burns, Melissa A', 'Place, Andrew E', 'Stevenson, Kristen E', 'Gutierrez, Alejandro', 'Forrest, Suzanne', 'Pikman, Yana', 'Vrooman, Lynda M', 'Harris, Marian H', 'Hunt, Sarah K', ""O'Brien, Jane E"", 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Athale, Uma H', 'Clavell, Luis A', 'Cole, Peter D', 'Gennarini, Lisa M', 'Kahn, Justine M', 'Kelly, Kara M', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Leclerc, Jean-Marie', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Schorin, Marshall A', 'Sulis, Maria Luisa', 'Welch, Jennifer J G', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B']","['Burns MA', 'Place AE', 'Stevenson KE', 'Gutierrez A', 'Forrest S', 'Pikman Y', 'Vrooman LM', 'Harris MH', 'Hunt SK', ""O'Brien JE"", 'Asselin BL', 'Athale UH', 'Clavell LA', 'Cole PD', 'Gennarini LM', 'Kahn JM', 'Kelly KM', 'Laverdiere C', 'Leclerc JM', 'Michon B', 'Schorin MA', 'Sulis ML', 'Welch JJG', 'Neuberg DS', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0953-766X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9604-4213', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3236-6560', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3525-8015', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3330-6754', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2110-0193', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9117-4812', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2566-3145']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Golisano Children's Hospital, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology, San Jorge Children's Hospital, San Juan, Puerto Rico."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers;

Report of five cases from a single centre cohort.,125-129,,"OBJECTIVES: To identify and record lymphomas of T cell origin in a single centre cohort of 110 Sjogren's syndrome (SS)-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients, followed up from 1993 to June 2020. METHODS: We searched for patients diagnosed with T cell lymphoma among 110 SS-associated NHL cases. Demographic data, history of previous lymphoma, histologic subtype, lymphoma stage, treatment schedules, and response to therapy were documented. RESULTS: Among the 110 SS-associated NHL patients, we identified five NHL cases of T cell origin, all of whom were women. The median time from SS diagnosis to T cell lymphoma development was 3.25 years. They all expressed at least one adverse predictive factor for lymphoma development. Lymphoma subtypes were identified as: two peripheral T cell lymphomas not otherwise specified (NOS) lymphomas, one primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma, one T large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukaemia and one angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma. All lymphomas were stage IV, apart from the latter case that was stage III, according to the Ann Arbor staging system. All lymphomas tested positive for T cell receptor (TCR) gamma clonal rearrangements in biopsy specimens, and two were also positive for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA (EBER). Two out of five patients had previously been diagnosed with B cell lymphoma, treated with combined immunochemotherapy, and one had been previously diagnosed with lymph node benign polyclonal follicular hyperplasia. CONCLUSIONS: SS-associated T cell lymphomas constitute a minority. Treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and viral infections may be implicated in their pathogenesis.","['Stergiou, Ioanna E', 'Papageorgiou, Aristea', 'Chatzis, Loukas G', 'Tzioufas, Athanasios G', 'Voulgarelis, Michalis', 'Goules, Andreas']","['Stergiou IE', 'Papageorgiou A', 'Chatzis LG', 'Tzioufas AG', 'Voulgarelis M', 'Goules A']",,"['Department of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. agoules@med.uoa.gr.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200930,Italy,Clin Exp Rheumatol,Clinical and experimental rheumatology,8308521,,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin', '*Lymphoma, T-Cell', ""*Sjogren's Syndrome/diagnosis/epidemiology"", 'T-Lymphocytes']",,,,2020/10/08 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2020/10/07 08:40'],"['2020/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/07 08:40 [entrez]']",['16240 [pii]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Rheumatol. 2020 Jul-Aug;38 Suppl 126(4):125-129.

Gastrointestinal side effects and hepatotoxicity are the most prevalent manifestations of MTX intolerance, frequently leading to discontinuation of otherwise effective treatment. Genetic variability within solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1), encoding a hepatic MTX membrane transporter, has been associated with high-dose MTX efficacy and toxicity in paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The aim of our study was to determine the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the SLCO1B1 gene (rs4149056, rs2306283) on the disease activity and presence of side effects of MTX therapy in patients with JIA.Method: The study recruited 100 children with JIA of all subtypes treated with MTX. Demographic and clinical parameters were collected at the baseline of MTX therapy and on a control visit 4-6 months after starting MTX. Genotyping was performed using genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples.Results: In comparison to wild-type allele, SLCO1B1 rs4149056 CT/CC variant was significantly associated with higher odds ratio of MTX gastrointestinal side effects occurrence (OR=4.55, 95%CI 1.37-15.13; p=0.013). SLCO1B1 rs4149056 TT subjects were more likely than CT/CC individuals to develop hepatotoxicity (17.86% vs 4.76%, p = 0.046).Conclusion: SLCO1B1 rs4149056 may serve as a determinant of MTX treatment toxicity in children with JIA.","['Roszkiewicz, J', 'Michalek, D', 'Ryk, A', 'Swacha, Z', 'Szmyd, B', 'Smolewska, E']","['Roszkiewicz J', 'Michalek D', 'Ryk A', 'Swacha Z', 'Szmyd B', 'Smolewska E']",,"['Department of Paediatric Cardiology and Rheumatology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Translational Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Translational Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Clinic of Dermatology, Military Medical Institute, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Oncology and Haematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Paediatric Cardiology and Rheumatology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201007,England,Scand J Rheumatol,Scandinavian journal of rheumatology,0321213,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1)', '0 (SLCO1B1 protein, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Antirheumatic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Juvenile/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1/*genetics', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2020/10/08 06:00,2021/09/08 06:00,['2020/10/07 08:39'],"['2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/07 08:39 [entrez]']",['10.1080/03009742.2020.1818821 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Rheumatol. 2021 May;50(3):213-217. doi: 10.1080/03009742.2020.1818821.

This study aims to investigate the involvement of the key molecules of IL-1 (interleukin-1) signaling pathways in pediatric patients with asthma. METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with IL-1 signaling pathways were identified with RNA-seq from peripheral blood samples collected from asthmatic or healthy children and were further verified in clinical peripheral blood samples. Cellular models and asthmatic mice were subsequently developed to validate the identified asthmatic markers. RESULTS: Among the DEGs identified by RNA-seq, eight signal transducers associated with the IL-1 signaling network, namely IL-1RN, IL-1beta, IL-1RAP, IRAK3, IL-1R1, MYD88, IRAK2, and PELI1, were found to be substantially upregulated in children with asthma. Interestingly, a significant serially increased expression of four genes (IL-1RN, IL-1RAP, IRAK3, and PELI1) was observed in healthy subjects, patients with chronic persistent asthma and patients with acute exacerbation asthma. In particular, these four genes were continuously overexpressed in recurrent patients. A significant induction of the above four genes was then observed in house dust mite (HDM)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthmatic mice. In addition, a time-dependent induction of IL-1RAP and PELI1 was also detected in HDM-treated THP-1 cells, an acute monocytic leukemia cell line. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that IL-1RN, IL-1RAP, IRAK3, and PELI1, which are signal transducers of the IL-1 signaling pathway, could serve as biomarkers for the pathogenesis of childhood asthma and for potential therapeutic targets of asthma.","['Wei, Wenping', 'Huang, Jiaqi', 'Ma, Yu', 'Ma, Xingjie', 'Fang, Ling', 'Fang, Wei', 'Hao, Chuangli']","['Wei W', 'Huang J', 'Ma Y', 'Ma X', 'Fang L', 'Fang W', 'Hao C']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3889-7277'],"[""Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", 'Department of pediatric, The Affiliated Hospital of Yangzhou University, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.', ""Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", ""Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China."", 'Department of Intensive Care, The Affiliated Hospital of Yangzhou University, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.', 'Department of The Central Laboratory, The Affiliated Hospital of Yangzhou University, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.', 'Department of pediatric, The Affiliated Hospital of Yangzhou University, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.', 'Department of pediatric, The Affiliated Hospital of Yangzhou University, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.', ""Department of Respiratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201104,England,Pediatr Allergy Immunol,Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,9106718,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peli1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Asthma', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1', '*Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*IL-1 signaling', '*IL-1RAP', '*IL-1RN', '*IRAK3', '*PELI1', '*asthmatic markers', '*childhood asthma']",2020/10/08 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2020/10/07 05:56'],"['2020/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/07 05:56 [entrez]']",['10.1111/pai.13388 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Allergy Immunol. 2021 Feb;32(2):305-313. doi: 10.1111/pai.13388.

The 2-year non-relapse mortality, relapse, disease-free and overall survival were 25% vs 8% (P = .01), 20% vs 16% (P = .2), 55% vs 76% (P = .004), 57% vs 83% (P = .004) for TCD and PTCy-Sir-MMF, respectively. Cumulative incidence of cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr infection requiring therapy was 76% vs 40% (P < .001) and 32% vs 0% (P < .001) in TCD and PTCy-Sir-MMF, respectively. PTCy-Sir-MMF platform showed faster T-cell reconstitution. CONCLUSIONS: PTCy-Sir-MMF provides better survival outcomes but is associated with higher risk of cGVHD compared to TCD.","['Montoro, Juan', 'Roldan, Elisa', 'Pinana, Jose Luis', 'Barba, Pere',

Energy restriction might be cancer protective, while malnutrition, vomiting, laxative and substance use might stimulate cancer development. We examined whether individuals with an eating disorder (not restricted to anorexia nervosa) had a different risk of developing cancer. METHODS: A systematic search on Medline and Embase until 28th April 2020 identified relevant human original research publications, including all populations and all cancer types. RESULTS: From 990 records, 6 case reports and 9 cohorts were included. Some cohorts found a decreased breast (3/5 studies) or cervical (1/2) cancer risk, while an increased esophageal (2/3), liver (1/1), brain (1/1 in men) and respiratory (2/4) cancer risk, but other cancer risks were non-significant, and an increased mortality overall (1/2), from breast (1/1), female genital (1/1) and skin (1/1) cancer in eating disorder patients. The case reports further described esophageal cancer and leukemia. No clear statistical differences in cancer risk were found depending on eating disorder type, perhaps due to the small sample size (n = 1783 for other than anorexia nervosa). CONCLUSIONS: The literature on eating disorders and cancer risk is sparse with many gaps. Hormonal changes, sexual activity, nutritional status, vomiting and concomitant tobacco/alcohol abuse may explain increased/decreased cancer risk. Future large studies (now 1-366 cancer cases) that also include men (now 4.7%), bulimia nervosa (now 3.8%) and several cancer sites (now mainly breast cancer) are needed and should foresee longer follow-up time (now 5.4-15.2 years) and extensive confounder adjustment (now only age and sex).

We investigated the interaction between nilotinib and BCRP in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells. An imatinib-resistant K562 cell line (K562/IM-R) treated with nilotinib was analyzed for BCRP expression, proliferation, apoptosis, and intracellular nilotinib concentration. K562/IM-R cells cultured with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) showed an increased cell count and retained viability, whereas the growth of parental K562 cells was severely inhibited, suggesting that BCRP is involved in developing resistance to TKIs. Nilotinib-treated K562/IM-R cells showed a reduction in apoptosis; however, febuxostat pretreatment resulted in increased apoptosis. The intracellular concentration of nilotinib in K562/IM-R cells was significantly reduced compared to that in parental K562 cells, and febuxostat-pretreated K562/IM-R cells showed an increased intracellular nilotinib level compared to cells without pretreatment. The reduction in nilotinib levels caused by BCRP in CML cells might play a crucial role in resistance to TKIs. Moreover, febuxostat, as a BCRP inhibitor, could enhance nilotinib sensitivity, and combination therapy with nilotinib and febuxostat may represent a promising strategy for treatment of CML.","['Ito, Fumiko', 'Miura, Masatomo', 'Fujioka, Yuki', 'Abumiya, Maiko', 'Kobayashi, Takahiro', 'Takahashi, Saori', 'Yoshioka, Tomoko', 'Kameoka, Yoshihiro', 'Takahashi, Naoto']","['Ito F', 'Miura M', 'Fujioka Y', 'Abumiya M', 'Kobayashi T', 'Takahashi S', 'Yoshioka T', 'Kameoka Y', 'Takahashi N']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6758-3787'],"['Department of Hematology, Nephrology and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita, Akita, 010-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita, Akita, 010-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita, Akita, 010-8543, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Promotion and Support Center, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita, Akita, 010-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita, Akita, 010-8543, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Promotion and Support Center, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Hondo, Akita, Akita, 010-8543, Japan. naotot@doc.med.akita-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201006,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '101V0R1N2E (Febuxostat)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Febuxostat/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*metabolism/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP)', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Febuxostat', 'Nilotinib', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)']",2020/10/08 06:00,2021/02/12 06:00,['2020/10/07 05:54'],"['2020/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/07 05:54 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-03000-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-03000-x [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2021 Jan;113(1):100-105. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-03000-x.

Its diagnosis is still difficult and demands sensitive methods. In Egypt, there is little documentation of infection among children with malignancies. This work was designed to study the infection rate of Cryptosporidium among children with malignancies, compare the performance of modified Ziehl-Neelsen (MZN) stain with nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and identify the species subtypes of positive cases. METHODS: The study was conducted on 100 children with malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumors), below 10 years of age, from El-Shatby hospital, Alexandria University. After obtaining the informed consent, their stool samples were collected and examined microscopically following MZN stain for the diagnosis of Cryptosporidium spp. All samples were then subjected to nested PCR. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) targeting the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene was applied to positive cases, using restriction enzyme RsaI for digestion of nested PCR products. RESULTS: Out of the 100 examined children, MZN detected higher positive cases compared to nested PCR. Six cases (6%) were diagnosed positive by MZN stain, three of which (3%) were concordantly positive by nested PCR. All positives were among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Fair agreement was found between the two tests (K = 0.36). Genotyping results revealed that positive samples were of Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) type II. CONCLUSIONS: Low Cryptosporidium infection rate was detected among children with malignancies. MZN diagnosed more positive cases compared to nested PCR. C. parvum type II was the identified species among the examined children. Further optimization of PCR steps is needed.","['Ibrahim, Heba Said', 'Shehab, Amel Youssef', 'Allam, Amal Farahat', 'Mohamed, Mostafa Aboelhoda', 'Farag, Hoda Fahmy', 'Tolba, Mona Mohamed']","['Ibrahim HS', 'Shehab AY', 'Allam AF', 'Mohamed MA', 'Farag HF', 'Tolba MM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4965-9469'],"['Department of Parasitology, Medical Research Institute, University of Alexandria, 165 El Horreya avenue, El Hadara, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Department of Parasitology, Medical Research Institute, University of Alexandria, 165 El Horreya avenue, El Hadara, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Department of Parasitology, Medical Research Institute, University of Alexandria, 165 El Horreya avenue, El Hadara, Alexandria, Egypt. amalalam2005@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Parasitology, Medical Research Institute, University of Alexandria, 165 El Horreya avenue, El Hadara, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Department of Parasitology, Medical Research Institute, University of Alexandria, 165 El Horreya avenue, El Hadara, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Department of Parasitology, Medical Research Institute, University of Alexandria, 165 El Horreya avenue, El Hadara, Alexandria, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201006,Switzerland,Acta Parasitol,Acta parasitologica,9301947,,IM,"['Child', '*Cryptosporidiosis/complications/diagnosis', '*Cryptosporidium', '*Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Egypt', 'Feces', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms/complications', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Children', 'Cryptosporidiosis', 'Leukemia', 'MZN', 'Nested PCR', 'RFLP']",2020/10/08 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2020/10/07 05:54'],"['2020/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/07 05:54 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11686-020-00250-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11686-020-00250-x [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Parasitol. 2021 Jun;66(2):377-383. doi: 10.1007/s11686-020-00250-x.

The present study was aimed to evaluate the cellular immunity, T-cell activation, humoral immunity, and inflammatory response hallmarks which affect HTLV-1-associated disease progression. A total of 78 participants were included in the study, comprising 39 HTLV-1 asymptomatic careers (ACs) and 39 healthy controls. The HTLV-proviral load (PVL) was determined via real-time PCR technique, and anti-HTLV antibody, sIL2R, sCD30, Neoptrin, hs-CRP, IgE, anti-VCA, anti-EBNA, and anti-EA were assessed by ELISA method. Mean PVL in ACs was 352.7 +/- 418.7 copies/10(4) PBMCs. A significant higher level of sIL-2R was observed in ACs (P < 0.0001). Anti-VCA antibody titer in ACs and healthy controls was 80.72 +/- 105.95 and 156.05 +/- 130.71, respectively (P = 0.007). Intriguingly, suppression in ACs immune response was not observed. Resultantly, HTLV-1 infection has no effect on the humoral immune response in ACs but greater T-cell activation and function cellular responses were detected. Finally, more studies on various immune markers in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients are greatly needed to illuminate the association of ACs' immune status with the development of the related diseases.","['Hedayati-Moghaddam, Mohammad Reza', 'Mollahosseini, Farzad', 'Namazi, Mohammad Javad', 'Mosavat, Arman', 'Rezaee, Seyed Abdolrahim', 'Mahdifar, Maryam', 'Bidkhori, Hamid Reza', 'Valizadeh, Narges', 'Rafatpanah, Houshang']","['Hedayati-Moghaddam MR', 'Mollahosseini F', 'Namazi MJ', 'Mosavat A', 'Rezaee SA', 'Mahdifar M', 'Bidkhori HR', 'Valizadeh N', 'Rafatpanah H']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9133-5006', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5680-3919', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8408-4664', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6814-5992', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0204-0351', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4254-7314', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1061-5864']","['Blood Borne Infections Research Center, Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research (ACECR), Razavi Khorasan, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine and Razavi Khorasan Blood Transfusion Center, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, Sabzevar University of Medical Sciences, Sabzevar, Iran.', 'Blood Borne Infections Research Center, Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research (ACECR), Razavi Khorasan, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, Mashhad, 9177948564, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, Mashhad, 9177948564, Iran.', 'Blood Borne Infections Research Center, Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research (ACECR), Razavi Khorasan, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, Mashhad, 9177948564, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Azadi-Square, Medical Campus, Mashhad, 9177948564, Iran.

Imatinib is the gold standard for frontline treatment of newly diagnosed CML-CP patients. The present study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of generic imatinib in newly diagnosed CML-CP patients. In this prospective study, 76 newly diagnosed CML-CP patients received generic imatinib. They were monitored as per the ELN2013 recommendation. Karyotyping and BCR-ABL transcript level were done at specified time points. Adverse effects, if any, were documented as per the NCI-CTCAE criteria v4.03. Statistical analysis was done using standard methods. A total of 76 patients included in the study; median age was 36 years. The most common (71%) presenting symptom was fatigue; splenomegaly was found in all patients. CHR was achieved in 97% cases. At 3 months, 64.5% patients achieved ERM. At 6 months, CCyR and MCyR had seen in 65% and 68% cases, respectively. MMR achieved at 12 months in 44% cases. Most common hematological and non-hematological toxicity were anemia and skin changes seen in 89.5% and 71% cases, respectively. With generic imatinib therapy, the results of treatment outcome and safety profile were comparable with original imatinib. The added advantage was gross reduction in cost of therapy meeting unmet needs in CML patients in countries with resource constraints.","['Phukan, Abhijit', 'Mandal, Prakas Kumar', 'Dolai, Tuphan K']","['Phukan A', 'Mandal PK', 'Dolai TK']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2955-3832'],"['Department of Hematology, NRS Medical College, 138, AJC Bose Road, Kolkata, 700014, India.', 'Department of Hematology, NRS Medical College, 138, AJC Bose Road, Kolkata, 700014, India. prakas70@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, NRS Medical College, 138, AJC Bose Road, Kolkata, 700014, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201006,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Generic)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Drugs, Generic/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematology/methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'India/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'Generic imatinib', 'Newly diagnosed', 'Safety profile', 'Treatment outcome']",2020/10/08 06:00,2021/01/14 06:00,['2020/10/07 05:53'],"['2020/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/07 05:53 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04289-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04289-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Jan;100(1):85-96. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04289-8.

We will review the current concept of what are DC, compare the differences in the epidemiology and economic burden of this disease between developed and DC, and finally, analyze the barriers and possible solutions that DC should implement to achieve better results. RECENT FINDINGS: DC is a frequently misunderstood name. The way we use to measure human development is changing, and multidimension metrics better define what are DC. With this in mind, we show the differences in the AML epidemiology and the impact of economic burden in DC. We analyze the barriers to access therapy from a clinician point of view, to show that most DC shared similar challenges but with a diverse healthcare structure. Finally, we provide several possible solutions for a more integrated and timely treatment that allows better results not only in terms of survival but with a better quality of life. The economic burden of AML treatment in DC is high, and the results are poor. It is crucial to face this challenge and propose new treatment approaches to achieve better results.","['Meillon-Garcia, Luis Antonio', 'Demichelis-Gomez, Roberta']","['Meillon-Garcia LA', 'Demichelis-Gomez R']",,"['The ABC Medical Center, Cancer Center, Av.

The limited efficacy of this compound as a monotherapy contrasts with that of its synergistic combination with standard cytarabine and daunorubicin (Dau), suggesting a therapeutic benefit that is not driven only by FLT3 inhibition. In an AML context, the activity of the enzyme aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) is a crucial factor in chemotherapy resistance, as it mediates the intracellular transformation of anthracyclines to less active hydroxy metabolites. Here, we report that midostaurin is a potent inhibitor of Dau inactivation mediated by AKR1C3 in both its recombinant form as well as during its overexpression in a transfected cell model. Likewise, in the FLT3(-) AML cell line KG1a, midostaurin was able to increase the cellular accumulation of Dau and significantly decrease its metabolism by AKR1C3 simultaneously. The combination of those mechanisms increased the nuclear localization of Dau, thus synergizing its cytotoxic effects on KG1a cells. Our results provide new in vitro evidence of how the therapeutic activity of midostaurin could operate beyond targeting the FLT3 receptor.","['Morell, Anselm', 'Novotna, Eva', 'Milan, Jaroslav', 'Danielisova, Petra', 'Bukum, Neslihan', 'Wsol, Vladimir']","['Morell A', 'Novotna E', 'Milan J', 'Danielisova P', 'Bukum N', 'Wsol V']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3745-7648'],"['Department of Biochemical Sciences, Charles University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Charles University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Charles University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Charles University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Charles University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemical Sciences, Charles University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Akademika Heyrovskeho 1203, 50005, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. wsol@faf.cuni.cz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201006,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 1.1.1.357 (AKR1C3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.357 (Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Member C3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Member C3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Biotransformation', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AKR1C3', '*AML therapy', '*Anthracyclines', '*Midostaurin', '*Multidrug resistance']",2020/10/08 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2020/10/07 05:52'],"['2020/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/07 05:52 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00204-020-02884-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00204-020-02884-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2021 Jan;95(1):67-78. doi: 10.1007/s00204-020-02884-2.

Here, we used mass spectrometry, T-cell receptor-beta (TCRbeta) deep sequencing, and cellular in vitro models of alloreactivity to interrogate the HLA-DP immunopeptidome and its role in alloreactive T-cell responses. We find that permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches display significantly higher peptide repertoire overlaps compared with their nonpermissive counterparts, resulting in lower frequency and diversity of alloreactive TCRbeta clonotypes in healthy individuals and transplanted patients. Permissiveness can be reversed by the absence of the peptide editor HLA-DM or the presence of its antagonist, HLA-DO, through significant broadening of the peptide repertoire. Our data establish the degree of immunopeptidome divergence between donor and recipient as the mechanistic basis for the clinically relevant permissive HLA-DPB1 mismatches in HCT and show that permissiveness is dependent on HLA-DM-mediated peptide editing. Its key role for harnessing T-cell alloreactivity to HLA-DP highlights HLA-DM as a potential novel target for cellular and immunotherapy of leukemia.","['Meurer, Thuja', 'Crivello, Pietro', 'Metzing, Maximilian', 'Kester, Michel', 'Megger, Dominik A', 'Chen, Weiqiang', 'van Veelen, Peter A', 'van Balen, Peter', 'Westendorf, Astrid M', 'Homa, Georg', 'Layer, Sophia E', 'Turki, Amin T', 'Griffioen, Marieke', 'Horn, Peter A', 'Sitek, Barbara', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Arrieta-Bolanos, Esteban', 'Fleischhauer, Katharina']","['Meurer T', 'Crivello P', 'Metzing M', 'Kester M', 'Megger DA', 'Chen W', 'van Veelen PA', 'van Balen P', 'Westendorf AM', 'Homa G', 'Layer SE', 'Turki AT', 'Griffioen M', 'Horn PA', 'Sitek B', 'Beelen DW', 'Falkenburg JHF', 'Arrieta-Bolanos E', 'Fleischhauer K']",,"['Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Medical Proteome Center, Center for Protein Diagnostics, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Medical Proteome Center, Center for Protein Diagnostics, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Centre for Proteomics and Metabolomics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Institute for Medical Microbiology.', 'Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, and.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany; and.', 'Medical Proteome Center, Center for Protein Diagnostics, Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, and.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, partner site Essen/Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cellular Therapy, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium, partner site Essen/Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DM antigens)', '0 (HLA-DO antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (invariant chain)']",IM,"['Allografts', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endosomes/metabolism', 'Epitopes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Rearrangement, alpha-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'HLA-D Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains/*immunology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histocompatibility/genetics/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Peptides/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/*immunology', 'Unrelated Donors']",,,,2020/10/08 06:00,2021/07/03 06:00,['2020/10/07 05:52'],"['2020/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/07 05:52 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(21)00313-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020008464 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Feb 18;137(7):923-928. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020008464.,['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,['Blood. 2021 Feb 18;137(7):864-865.

Disappointingly, response rates have been low in the non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with no activity seen in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with PD-1 blockade. Thus, identifying more powerful combination therapy is required for these patients. Here, we preclinically demonstrate enhanced anti-CLL activity following combinational therapy with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) and avadomide, a cereblon E3 ligase modulator (CELMoD). Avadomide induced type I and II interferon (IFN) signaling in patient T cells, triggering a feedforward cascade of reinvigorated T-cell responses. Immune modeling assays demonstrated that avadomide stimulated T-cell activation, chemokine expression, motility and lytic synapses with CLL cells, as well as IFN-inducible feedback inhibition through upregulation of PD-L1. Patient-derived xenograft tumors treated with avadomide were converted to CD8+ T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironments that responded to anti-PD-L1/PD-1-based combination therapy. Notably, clinical analyses showed increased PD-L1 expression on T cells, as well as intratumoral expression of chemokine signaling genes in B-cell malignancy patients receiving avadomide-based therapy. These data illustrate the importance of overcoming a low inflammatory T-cell state to successfully sensitize CLL to checkpoint blockade-based combination therapy.","['Ioannou, Nikolaos', 'Hagner, Patrick R', 'Stokes, Matt', 'Gandhi, Anita K', 'Apollonio, Benedetta', 'Fanous, Mariam', 'Papazoglou, Despoina', 'Sutton, Lesley-Ann', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Amini, Rose-Marie', 'Chiu, Hsiling', 'Lopez-Girona, Antonia', 'Janardhanan, Preethi', 'Awan, Farrukh T', 'Jones, Jeffrey', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Patten, Piers E M', 'Vardi, Anna', 'Ramsay, Alan G']","['Ioannou N', 'Hagner PR', 'Stokes M', 'Gandhi AK', 'Apollonio B', 'Fanous M', 'Papazoglou D', 'Sutton LA', 'Rosenquist R', 'Amini RM', 'Chiu H', 'Lopez-Girona A', 'Janardhanan P', 'Awan FT', 'Jones J', 'Kay NE', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Tallman MS', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Patten PEM', 'Vardi A', 'Ramsay AG']",,"[""School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Summit, NJ.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Summit, NJ.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Summit, NJ.', ""School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Clinical Genetics, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University and University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Summit, NJ.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, San Diego, CA.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, San Diego, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Summit, NJ.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Stanford University, School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', ""School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Life Sciences & Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Haematology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom; and."", 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Hematology Department and HCT Unit, G.

Given their effectiveness as single agents in mIDH1/2 relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), this phase 1 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ivosidenib or enasidenib combined with intensive chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed mIDH1/2 AML. Ivosidenib 500 mg once daily and enasidenib 100 mg once daily were well tolerated in this setting, with safety profiles generally consistent with those of induction and consolidation chemotherapy alone. The frequency of IDH differentiation syndrome was low, as expected given the concurrent administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In patients receiving ivosidenib, the frequency and grades of QT interval prolongation were similar to those observed with ivosidenib monotherapy. Increases in total bilirubin were more frequently observed in patients treated with enasidenib, consistent with this inhibitor's known potential to inhibit UGT1A1, but did not appear to have significant clinical consequences.

Today, many standard clinical methods such as cytogenetic and PCR based techniques are used which have limitation regarding detection resolution. Chromosome conformation capture is a method for detecting gene proximity and chromosomal rearrangements. Materials and Methods: In this study, SKW3 cell line was used for detecting t(8;14)(q24;q11) using a 3C-based technique. SKW3 cell line was used for 3C library preparation. For Inverse PCR, two regions were selected in upstream and downstream of the viewpoint locus on chromosome 8-MYC gene based on EcoRI restriction sites. The captured sequence with intra-chromosomal interaction between chr8-c-MYC and chr14-TRD was selected for the translocation PCR primer design. Results: The DNA fragment captured in 3C PCR showed a specific TRD sequence translocated downstream of the MYC gene. Translocation PCR demonstrated the existence of (8; 14) (q24; q11) MYC /TRD in both library and genomic DNA. Conclusion: This result demonstrated 3C- based method could be used as a useful low-cost easy operating technique in chromosomal rearrangements detection. In this study, the integration of whole genome library monitoring and PCR method was used as a high- through put method in chromosomal breakpoints detection.","['Absalan, Moloud', 'Ghahremani, Mohammad Hossein', 'Jabbarpour, Zahra', 'Karimi, Roya', 'Shafei, Shilan', 'Heidari, Reza', 'Akbariqomi, Mostafa', 'Tavoosidana, Gholamreza']","['Absalan M', 'Ghahremani MH', 'Jabbarpour Z', 'Karimi R', 'Shafei S', 'Heidari R', 'Akbariqomi M', 'Tavoosidana G']",,"['Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Tissue Engineering and Applied Cell Sciences, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,,PMC7521395,['NOTNLM'],"['Chromosomal rearrangements', 'Chromosome conformation capture', 'Inverse-polymerase chain reaction', 'MYC/TRD']",2020/10/08 06:00,2020/10/08 06:01,['2020/10/07 05:50'],"['2020/10/07 05:50 [entrez]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18502/ijhoscr.v14i3.3729 [doi]', 'IJHOSCR-14-200 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2020 Jul 1;14(3):200-212. doi: 10.18502/ijhoscr.v14i3.3729.,"['Copyright : (c) International Journal of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell', 'Research & Tehran University of Medical Sciences.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relationship between relative telomere length (RTL) and the two linked hematological stem cell disorders, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still unclear. Materials and Methods: We evaluated the role of RTL in MDS (n=96) and AML (n=130) at the time of diagnosis using a real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. The median value of RTL (1) was set as the cutoff for statistical comparison. Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from diagnosis to death or last follow-up. Results: RTL was significantly longer in both MDS and AML cases versus control (p<0.0001) and was significantly longer in MDS versus AML cases (p =0.03). RTL correlated negatively with age in MDS (p <0.0001) but not in AML cases. RTL was also significantly shorter in MDS cases with pancytopenia and poor risk cytogenetics (p < 0.0001 for each) and short RTL was significantly associated with inferior survival (p = 0.007), while RTL showed no significant impact on OS in AML cases. Moreover, short RTL retained independent prognostic value in multivariate analysis (HR= 3.42 [95% CI, 8.97-19.35], p = 0.004). Conclusion: RTL showed an association with both AML and MDS; however, short RTL was an independent poor prognostic factor in MDS patients only.","['Menshawy, Nadia El', 'Ashwah, Shaimaa El', 'Ebrahim, Mohamed A']","['Menshawy NE', 'Ashwah SE', 'Ebrahim MA']",,"['Clinical Pathology, Hematology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Clinical Hematology Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Medical Oncology Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,,PMC7521393,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Myelodysplatic syndromes', 'Relative telomere length']",2020/10/08 06:00,2020/10/08 06:01,['2020/10/07 05:50'],"['2020/10/07 05:50 [entrez]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18502/ijhoscr.v14i3.3728 [doi]', 'IJHOSCR-14-188 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2020 Jul 1;14(3):188-199. doi: 10.18502/ijhoscr.v14i3.3728.,"['Copyright : (c) International Journal of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell', 'Research & Tehran University of Medical Sciences.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Busulfan, depletes glutathione level in liver and causes elevated levels of CY metabolites. Cyclophosphamide metabolites are highly toxic for sinusoidal endothelial cells and cause VOD/ SOS with high mortality rate. Materials and Methods: Between September 2013 and September 2015, all adult patients with acute leukemia who were candidates for myeloablative allogenic SCT and were admitted to Stem Cell Transplantation center were enrolled in this prospective randomized clinical trial. We tested the hypothesis that reverse administration from BU-CY (n=28) to CY-BU group (n=27) would reduce liver toxicity. Results: Liver function tests were significantly higher in the BU-CY group between day -1 and +4 (p<0.05), but VOD/SOS was not diagnosed in both groups. The incidence and severity of acute GVHD was higher in the BU-CY group, but not statistically significant. Engraftment and mortality rate were not different.

Publications on the subject are scarce, especially in low-income regions and the safety in this population remains to be determined. The present study aims to assess the safety of consolidation with high-dose cytarabine in the outpatient setting. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 39 patients who underwent consolidation with high-dose cytarabine, between 2009 and 2018, at Ophir Loyola Hospital, in Belem, Brazil. Patients treated after 2015 were given high-dose cytarabine as outpatients due to the decision of medical staff. Results: Twenty-seven patients received 76 cycles of cytarabine as outpatients; males were 48.14% of the total population, with a median age of approximately 45 years. The occurrence of delay between cycles was significantly lower among outpatients (48.14% vs. 83.33%, p = 0.04). There was no difference in relapse rates, transfusion requirements and non-relapse mortality between both groups. Hospitalization was required in 40.74% of patients during outpatient cycles and 18.51% of blood cultures were positive for pathogens. Non-relapse mortality was significantly higher among patients above 50 years old and treated on an outpatient basis (44.4% vs. 5.60%, p = 0.03). Conclusion: High-dose cytarabine administration on an outpatient basis appears to be safe and effective in a low-income population at the Brazilian Amazon region, but toxicity seems to be increased for patients older than 50 years.","['Rodrigues, Amanda Lopes Maia', 'do Nascimento, Daniel Macedo', 'de Lima, Josy Marinho', 'Reis, Marcos Laercio Pontes', 'Leao, Lucyana Barbosa Cardoso', 'Azevedo, Murilo Chermont', 'Muccini, Samanta Ribeiro', 'da Silva, Polyana Castanha', 'Carneiro, Thiago Xavier']","['Rodrigues ALM', 'do Nascimento DM', 'de Lima JM', 'Reis MLP', 'Leao LBC', 'Azevedo MC', 'Muccini SR', 'da Silva PC', 'Carneiro TX']",,"['School of Medical Sciences, Para State University, Belem - PA, Brazil.', 'School of Medical Sciences, Para State University, Belem - PA, Brazil.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ophir Loyola Hospital, Belem - PA, Brazil.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ophir Loyola Hospital, Belem - PA, Brazil.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ophir Loyola Hospital, Belem - PA, Brazil.', 'School of Medical Sciences, Federal University of Para, Belem - PA, Brazil.', 'School of Medical Sciences, Federal University of Para, Belem - PA, Brazil.', 'School of Medical Sciences, Federal University of Para, Belem - PA, Brazil.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ophir Loyola Hospital, Belem - PA, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,,PMC7521396,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chemotherapy', 'High drug dose', 'Low-income population', 'Outpatient care']",2020/10/08 06:00,2020/10/08 06:01,['2020/10/07 05:50'],"['2020/10/07 05:50 [entrez]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18502/ijhoscr.v14i3.3722 [doi]', 'IJHOSCR-14-151 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2020 Jul 1;14(3):151-156. doi: 10.18502/ijhoscr.v14i3.3722.,"['Copyright : (c) International Journal of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell', 'Research & Tehran University of Medical Sciences.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated toxicity and efficacy of CPX-351 in 71 elderly patients (median age 66 years) with sAML enrolled in the Italian Named (Compassionate) Use Program. Sixty days treatment-related mortality was 7% (5/71). The response rate at the end of treatment was: CR/CRi in 50/71 patients (70.4%), PR in 6/71 (8.5%), and NR in 10/71 (19.7%). After a median follow-up of 11 months relapse was observed in 10/50 patients (20%) and 12 months cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 23.6%. Median duration of response was not reached.

A number of genetic abnormalities have been identified in MDS and sAML, but sensitive sequencing methods can detect these mutations in nearly all healthy individuals by 60 years of age. To discover novel cellular pathways that accelerate MDS and sAML, we performed a CRISPR/Cas9 screen in the human MDS-L cell line. We report here that loss of the F-Box protein FBXO11, a component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, confers cytokine independent growth to MDS-L cells, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for FBXO11 in myeloid malignancies. Putative FBXO11 substrates are enriched for proteins with functions in RNA metabolism and, of note, spliceosome mutations that are commonly found in MDS/sAML are rare in patients with low FBXO11 expression. We also reveal that loss of FBXO11 leads to significant changes in transcriptional pathways influencing leukocyte proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Last, we find that FBXO11 expression is reduced in patients with secondary AML. We conclude that loss of FBXO11 is a mechanism for disease transformation of MDS into AML, and may represent a future therapeutic target.","['Schieber, Michael', 'Marinaccio, Christian', 'Bolanos, Lyndsey C', 'Haffey, Wendy D', 'Greis, Kenneth D', 'Starczynowski, Daniel T', 'Crispino, John D']","['Schieber M', 'Marinaccio C', 'Bolanos LC', 'Haffey WD', 'Greis KD', 'Starczynowski DT', 'Crispino JD']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9994-8579', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5447-5277', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8182-8306']","['Robert H.

However, two major operational challenges in L-TXM still need to be addressed: a small field of view and a potentially misaligned rotation stage. As it is not possible to alter the magnification during operation, the field of view in L-TXM is usually limited to a few tens of micrometers. This complicates locating areas and objects of interest in the sample. Additionally, if the rotation axis of the sample stage cannot be adjusted prior to the experiments, an efficient workflow for tomographic imaging cannot be established, as refocusing and sample repositioning will become necessary after each recorded projection. Both these limitations have been overcome with the integration of a visible-light microscope (VLM) into the L-TXM system. Here, we describe the calibration procedure of the goniometer sample stage and the integrated VLM and present the resulting 3D imaging of a test sample. In addition, utilizing this newly integrated VLM, the extracellular matrix of cryofixed THP-1 cells (human acute monocytic leukemia cells) was visualized by L-TXM for the first time in the context of an ongoing biomedical research project.","['Dehlinger, Aurelie', 'Seim, Christian', 'Stiel, Holger', 'Twamley, Shailey', 'Ludwig, Antje', 'Kordel, Mikael', 'Grotzsch, Daniel', 'Rehbein, Stefan', 'Kanngiesser, Birgit']","['Dehlinger A', 'Seim C', 'Stiel H', 'Twamley S', 'Ludwig A', 'Kordel M', 'Grotzsch D', 'Rehbein S', 'Kanngiesser B']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4866-1663', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3717-7307']","['Technische Universitat Berlin, Institut fur Optik und Atomare Physik, Hardenbergstrasse 36, Berlin10623, Germany.', 'Berlin Laboratory for Innovative X-ray technologies (BLiX), Hardenbergstrasse 36, Berlin10623, Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Berlin, Institut fur Optik und Atomare Physik, Hardenbergstrasse 36, Berlin10623, Germany.', 'Berlin Laboratory for Innovative X-ray technologies (BLiX), Hardenbergstrasse 36, Berlin10623, Germany.', 'Berlin Laboratory for Innovative X-ray technologies (BLiX), Hardenbergstrasse 36, Berlin10623, Germany.', 'Max-Born-Institut (MBI) im Forschungsverbund Berlin e.V., Max-Born-Strasse 2A, Berlin12489, Germany.', 'Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Medizinische Klinik fur Kardiologie und Angiologie, Campus Mitte, Chariteplatz 1, 10117Berlin, Germany.', 'DZHK (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Berlin, Chariteplatz 1, 10117Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Medizinische Klinik fur Kardiologie und Angiologie, Campus Mitte, Chariteplatz 1, 10117Berlin, Germany.', 'DZHK (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Berlin, Chariteplatz 1, 10117Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universitat Berlin, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, and Berlin Institute of Health, Klinik fur Radiologie, Chariteplatz 1, 10117Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Applied Physics, KTH Royal Institute of Technology/Albanova, Stockholm106 91, Sweden.', 'Technische Universitat Berlin, Institut fur Optik und Atomare Physik, Hardenbergstrasse 36, Berlin10623, Germany.', 'Berlin Laboratory for Innovative X-ray technologies (BLiX), Hardenbergstrasse 36, Berlin10623, Germany.', 'Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin fur Materialien und Energie GmbH, Wilhelm-Conrad-Rontgen Campus, Albert-Einstein-Str. 15, Berlin12489, Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Berlin, Institut fur Optik und Atomare Physik, Hardenbergstrasse 36, Berlin10623, Germany.', 'Berlin Laboratory for Innovative X-ray technologies (BLiX), Hardenbergstrasse 36, Berlin10623, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Microsc Microanal,"Microscopy and microanalysis : the official journal of Microscopy Society of America, Microbeam Analysis Society, Microscopical Society of Canada",9712707,,IM,"['Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', '*Laboratories', '*Microscopy', 'Synchrotrons', 'Workflow', 'X-Rays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*X-ray tomography', '*cell imaging', '*correlative microscopy', '*cryo microscopy', '*water-window X-ray microscopy']",2020/10/08 06:00,2021/09/08 06:00,['2020/10/07 05:34'],"['2020/10/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/07 05:34 [entrez]']","['10.1017/S1431927620024447 [doi]', 'S1431927620024447 [pii]']",ppublish,Microsc Microanal. 2020 Dec;26(6):1124-1132. doi: 10.1017/S1431927620024447.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A systematic review/meta-analysis was therefore performed to examine this association with physical activity (total, recreational or occupational). METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science and Embase were reviewed from inception to October 2019 identifying relevant observational studies. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) including subtypes diffuse large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) were analyzed. Included studies reported activity, lymphoma cases, effect size and variability measures, and were restricted to human subjects of any age. Data was pooled generating summary relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models with primary outcome of histologically confirmed incident lymphoma. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred studies were initially identified with 18 studies (nine cohort, nine case-control) included in final analysis. Comparing highest vs. lowest activity categories was protective for all lymphoma (RR 0.89, 95%CI 0.81-0.98). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated effect persistence within case-control studies (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.96), but not cohort studies (RR 0.95, 95%CI 0.84-1.07). Borderline protective effect was seen for NHL (RR 0.92, 95%CI 0.84-1.00), but not HL (RR 0.72, 95%CI 0.50-1.04). Analysis by NHL subtype or gender showed no effect. Dose response analysis demonstrated a protective effect (p = 0.034) with a 1% risk reduction per 3 MET hours/week (RR 0.99, 95%CI 0.98-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity may have a protective effect against lymphoma development; further studies are required to generate recommendations regarding health policy.

CXorf48 expression was examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using nine myeloma cell lines. Cell lines with low CXorf48 expression were treated by demethylating agents (DMAs), 5-azacytidine (5-aza), and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) to evaluate gene expression using quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, CXorf48-specific CTLs were induced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HLA-A*24:02-positive healthy donors to evaluate antigen recognition using ELISpot and (51)Cr cytotoxicity assays. CXorf48 was widely expressed in myeloma cells, and gene expression was significantly increased by DMAs. Furthermore, CXorf48-specific CTLs recognized DMA-treated myeloma cells.

We collected 142,386 leukemia patients who had been added to the SEER database from 1975 to 2017, of whom 191 patients committed suicide over an observation period of 95,397 person-years. The suicide rate of leukemia patients was 26.41 per 100,000 person-years, and hence the SMR of the suicided leukemia patients was 2.16 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.85-2.47). The univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that a high risk of suicide was associated with male sex (vs. female: hazard ratio [HR] = 4.41, 95% CI = 2.93-6.63, p < 0.001), older age at diagnosis (60-69 years vs. </=39 years: HR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.60-4.23, p < 0.001; 70-79 years vs. </=39 years: HR = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.72-4.68, p < 0.001; >/=80 years vs. </=39 years: HR = 2.94, 95% CI = 1.65-5.21, p < 0.001), white race (vs. black: HR = 6.80, 95% CI = 1.69-27.40, p = 0.007), acute myeloid leukemia (vs. lymphocytic leukemia: HR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.09-2.33, p = 0.016), unspecified and other specified leukemia (vs. lymphocytic leukemia: HR = 2.72, 95% CI = 1.55-4.75, p < 0.001), and living in a small city (vs. large city: HR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.23-3.60, p = 0.007). Meanwhile, being a non-Hispanic black (vs. Hispanic: HR = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.01-0.62, p = 0.019) was a protective factor for suicide. Male sex, older age at diagnosis, white race, and acute myeloid leukemia were risk factors for suicide in leukemia patients, while being a non-Hispanic black was a protective factor. Medical workers should, therefore, provide targeted preventive measures to leukemia patients with a high risk of suicide.","['Yu, Haohui', 'Cai, Ke', 'Huang, Yulin', 'Lyu, Jun']","['Yu H', 'Cai K', 'Huang Y', 'Lyu J']",,"['The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20201006,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,,IM,"['Adult', 'African Americans', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/ethnology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protective Factors', 'Race Factors', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Sex Factors', '*Suicide/ethnology', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites']",PMC7724501,['NOTNLM'],"['*SEER', '*leukemia', '*risk factors', '*suicide']",2020/10/07 06:00,2021/07/22 06:00,['2020/10/06 20:19'],"['2020/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/06 20:19 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3502 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2020 Dec;9(23):9006-9017. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3502.

This study retrospectively evaluates the efficacy of an RCD (rituximab, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone) regimen in the treatment of 51 patients with relapsed CLL (median age, 72 years). Unfavourable prognostic features, such as Rai stage III/IV, unmutated IGHV, del11q, TP53 mutation/deletion, complex karyotype and bulky lymphadenopathy, were frequent. The overall response or complete remission was of 57% and 7%, respectively, and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was of 12.3 months, median time to next treatment 23.1 months and median overall survival 39.2 months. Significant independent predictors of shorter PFS were TP53 deletion/mutation, advanced Rai stage and >/=2 previous lines of treatment. The incidence of neutropenia grade >/= 3 was of 13%. Serious (CTCAE grade 3-5) infections were found in 20% of patients. Steroid-induced diabetes or diabetes decompensation occurred in 20% patients. Treatment-related adverse events resulted in RCD dose reduction in 35% of patients. In comparison with a historical R-Dex patient group, the treatment response and/or toxicity in our group was largely similar. However, the substantial differences in the baseline clinical characteristics of the groups may affect this comparison. In conclusion, the RCD regimen is an active, time-limited therapeutic strategy for elderly patients with relapsed CLL. Further, the results of our analysis indicate that the addition of cyclophosphamide to the R-Dex regimen maintains a similar efficacy, even after 50% reduction in the dexamethasone dose.","['Simkovic, Martin', 'Vodarek, Pavel', 'Motyckova, Monika', 'Ecsiova, Dominika', 'Rozsivalova, Petra', 'Mocikova, Heidi', 'Stepankova, Pavla', 'Sykorova, Alice', 'Hrochova, Katerina', 'Vrbacky, Filip', 'Belada, David', 'Zak, Pavel', 'Smolej, Lukas']","['Simkovic M', 'Vodarek P', 'Motyckova M', 'Ecsiova D', 'Rozsivalova P', 'Mocikova H', 'Stepankova P', 'Sykorova A', 'Hrochova K', 'Vrbacky F', 'Belada D', 'Zak P', 'Smolej L']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0331-5334', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8050-7594', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6897-8756', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9880-117X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4465-5343', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4187-8595']","['4th Department of Internal Medicine - Haematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, University Hospital and Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine - Haematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, University Hospital and Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine - Haematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, University Hospital and Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine - Haematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, University Hospital and Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Hospital Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, University Hospital and Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Diagnostics, University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine - Haematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, University Hospital and Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine - Haematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, University Hospital and Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Haematology, University Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady and Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine - Haematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, University Hospital and Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine - Haematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, University Hospital and Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine - Haematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, University Hospital and Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', '4th Department of Internal Medicine - Haematology, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, University Hospital and Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201022,England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Diabetes Mellitus/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Drug Tapering', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infections/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['chemoimmunotherapy', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'cyclophosphamide', 'dexamethasone', 'rituximab']",2020/10/07 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2020/10/06 20:18'],"['2020/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/06 20:18 [entrez]']",['10.1111/eci.13421 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 2021 Apr;51(4):e13421. doi: 10.1111/eci.13421.

We sought to identify genes crucial to deregulated AML signal transduction pathways which, if inhibited, could effectively eradicate leukaemia stem cells. Due to difficulties in screening primary cells, most previous studies have performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) library knockdown screens in cell lines. Using carefully considered methods including evaluation at multiple timepoints to ensure equitable gene knockdown, we employed a large NGS short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown screen of nearly 5 000 genes in primary AML cells from six patients to identify genes that are crucial for leukaemic survival. Across various levels of stringency, genome-wide bioinformatic analysis identified a gene in the NOX family, NOX1, to have the most consistent knockdown effectiveness in primary cells (P = 539 x 10(-5) , Bonferroni-adjusted), impacting leukaemia cell survival as the top-ranked gene for two of the six AML patients and also showing high effectiveness in three of the other four patients. Further investigation of this pathway highlighted NOX2 as the member of the NOX family with clear knockdown efficacy. We conclude that genes in the NOX family are enticing candidates for therapeutic development in AML.","['Mason, Clinton C', 'Fiol, Carme R', 'Baker, Monika J', 'Nadal-Melsio, Elisabet', 'Yebra-Fernandez, Eva', 'Bicalho, Luciana', 'Chowdhury, Avirup', 'Albert, Michael', 'Reid, Alistair G', 'Claudiani, Simone', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Khorashad, Jamshid S']","['Mason CC', 'Fiol CR', 'Baker MJ', 'Nadal-Melsio E', 'Yebra-Fernandez E', 'Bicalho L', 'Chowdhury A', 'Albert M', 'Reid AG', 'Claudiani S', 'Apperley JF', 'Khorashad JS']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9817-0603', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6961-7311']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'SIHMDS North West London Pathology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.', 'SIHMDS North West London Pathology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.', 'Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Liverpool University, Liverpool, UK.', 'Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Imperial College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201006,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)']",IM,"['Drug Discovery', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genomics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'NADPH Oxidase 2/genetics']",,,,2020/10/07 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2020/10/06 20:18'],"['2020/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/06 20:18 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17129 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Jan;192(1):137-145. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17129.

Discontinuation of therapy is attractive to both patients and physicians because maintaining a stable BCR-ABL transcript level without therapy would imply true operational CML cure. With TFR, patients are not exposed to unknown long-term adverse effects of TKIs and common adverse effects that may affect quality of life. Several factors need to be considered before attempting TFR, because this goal is not appropriate for a significant proportion of patients with CML. Patient-related factors, CML response to therapy and its duration, monitoring capacity, patient preferences and compliance with monitoring, and economic factors influence the decision to attempt to discontinue TKIs. Unfortunately, only 50% of patients are appropriate candidates for discontinuation of treatment. Of those, another 50% maintain stable disease while off TKIs. This means that merely 25% of patients achieve TFR. Further optimization and research are required to be able to extend this treatment goal to a larger population of patients. Although TFR is attractive and desirable, this goal is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and we should continue to focus on patients with CML having a normal OS with the best quality of life possible.","['Garcia-Horton, Alejandro', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H']","['Garcia-Horton A', 'Lipton JH']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0579-6709'],"['Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre - University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre - University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20201001,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', '*Quality of Life', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2020/10/07 06:00,2021/11/05 06:00,['2020/10/06 20:17'],"['2020/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/06 20:17 [entrez]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.6004/jnccn.2020.7627 [doi]', 'jnccn20139 [pii]']",epublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2020 Oct 1;18(10):1421-1428. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2020.7627.

Cellular therapies are necessary to establish normal T cell function and to allow for long-term survival. This is most commonly achieved by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but the outcome of this procedure is impaired if active infections are present at the time of HSCT. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) are a well-established therapeutic strategy following HSCT to treat viral infections, improve donor cell engraftment, or achieve graft-versus-leukemia activity in malignant disease. Here we present a cohort of 6 patients with primary T cell deficiencies who received transfusions of unselected mature donor lymphocytes prior and not directly related to allogeneic HSCT. DLIs obtained from the peripheral blood of HLA-identical (10/10) family donors were transfused without prior conditioning to treat or prevent life-threatening infections. All patients are alive with a follow-up of 0.5 to 16.5 years after the initial T cell administration. Additional cellular therapies were administered in 5 of 6 patients at 0.8 to 15 months after the first DLI. Mild cutaneous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD, stage </=2) was observed in 3 of 6 patients and resolved spontaneously. We provide evidence that unselected HLA-identical DLIs can effectively prevent or contribute to overcome infections with a limited risk for GVHD in T cell deficient patients. The T cell system established by this readily available source can provide T cell function for years and can serve as a bridge to additional cellular therapies or, in specific conditions, as definite treatment.","['Hoenig, Manfred', 'Roesler, Joachim', 'Seidel, Markus G', 'Albert, Michael H', 'Hauck, Fabian', 'Maecker-Kolhoff, Britta', 'Eiz-Vesper, Britta', 'Kleinschmidt, Katharina', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Jacobsen, Eva-Maria', 'Furlan, Ingrid', 'Suttorp, Meinolf', 'Schuetz, Catharina', 'Schulz, Ansgar S']","['Hoenig M', 'Roesler J', 'Seidel MG', 'Albert MH', 'Hauck F', 'Maecker-Kolhoff B', 'Eiz-Vesper B', 'Kleinschmidt K', 'Debatin KM', 'Jacobsen EM', 'Furlan I', 'Suttorp M', 'Schuetz C', 'Schulz AS']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Ulm, Ulm, Germany.

Recently, we reported that CCR4 C-terminal gain-of-function mutations were frequent in ATL cases, and a subgroup with these mutations who were treated without allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and with mogamulizumab-containing [HSCT (-) and mogamulizumab (+)] regimens had a superior survival rate. Although these mutations are most likely a biomarker for predicting a strong response to mogamulizumab, their detection is time-consuming and costly. A more convenient screening tool may be necessary in the clinical setting. In this study, the clinicopathological importance of immunohistochemistry for the CCR4 N-terminus (CCR4-N-IHC) and C-terminus (CCR4-C-IHC) was examined in a large ATL cohort (n = 92). We found that CCR4-C-IHC, but not CCR4-N-IHC, was inversely correlated with the CCR4 mutation status. In ATL patients negative for CCR4-C-IHC, a subgroup treated with HSCT (-) and mogamulizumab (+) regimens showed a significantly better prognosis. In addition, CCR4-C-IHC was found to be a useful marker for high-sensitivity screening of the CCR4 mutational status (87%). The present study suggests that CCR4-C-IHC may be useful for identifying ATL patients harboring mutated CCR4 who may benefit from the superior efficacy of mogamulizumab-containing regimens and that CCR4-C-IHC may be a rapid and cost-efficient tool for screening for CCR4 mutation status.","['Fujii, Keiichiro', 'Sakamoto, Yuma', 'Masaki, Ayako', 'Murase, Takayuki', 'Tashiro, Yukie', 'Yonekura, Kentaro', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Ito, Asahi', 'Kusumoto, Shigeru', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Ueda, Ryuzo', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi']","['Fujii K', 'Sakamoto Y', 'Masaki A', 'Murase T', 'Tashiro Y', 'Yonekura K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Ito A', 'Kusumoto S', 'Iida S', 'Ueda R', 'Ishida T', 'Inagaki H']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6157-636X'],"['Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Immunology, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201006,England,J Pathol Clin Res,The journal of pathology.

We conducted a phase 1 study to assess the safety of its combination with obinutuzumab and evaluate early efficacy in 81 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) or relapsed/refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL). In this phase 1b study, zanubrutinib was tolerable at 160 mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily combined with IV obinutuzumab in patients with CLL/SLL (n = 45) and FL (n = 36). Common adverse events (AEs) included upper respiratory tract infection (51%; n = 23), neutropenia (44%; n = 20), contusion (33%; n = 15), cough, diarrhea, or fatigue (27%; n = 12 each), and pyrexia (22%; n = 10) in CLL/SLL patients and upper respiratory tract infection (39%; n = 14), contusion (28%; n = 10), fatigue (25%; n = 9), and cough (22%; n = 8) in FL patients. Neutropenia was the most common grade 3/4 AE (CLL/SLL, 31% [n = 14]; FL, 14% [n = 5]). Five patients required temporary dose reductions, and 5 discontinued the study drug because of AEs.

This report describes a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and the unusual JAK2 R795S mutation and reviews 23 additional patients with JAK2 gene mutations coexisting with myelofibrosis (MF) and CML. CASE REPORT A 50-year-old woman with MF experienced rapid disease progression 3 weeks later, accompanied by severe abdominal pain and a white blood cell count of 257.45x10(9)/l. Karyotype analysis indicated that she was 46, XY, Philadelphia (Ph) (+) and BCR-ABL1 positive. Bone marrow aspiration after 1 cycle of chemotherapy and treatment with dasatinib showed that her marrow was hypercellular, with an increased number of megakaryocytes and 48.5% myeloblasts expressing the myeloid antigens CD33, CD13, CD34, CD117, and CD71. Next-generation sequencing identified a rare JAK2 R795S mutation. She was diagnosed with CML in blast phase, and was successfully treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). CONCLUSIONS JAK2 gene mutations, including the rare JAK2 R795S mutation, can coexist with BCR-ABL1 in patients with MPNs. The clinical course of MPN in patients with both BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 mutations may be different from that in patients with classical MPNs.","['Yue, Yanhua', 'Wei, Wei', 'Guo, Yanting', 'Wang, Fei', 'Dong, Weimin', 'Liu, Yue', 'Lin, Yan', 'Cao, Yang', 'Gu, Weiying']","['Yue Y', 'Wei W', 'Guo Y', 'Wang F', 'Dong W', 'Liu Y', 'Lin Y', 'Cao Y', 'Gu W']",,"[""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Changzhou, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China (mainland).""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20201006,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/therapy', '*Primary Myelofibrosis']",PMC7548110,,,2020/10/07 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/10/06 17:12'],"['2020/10/06 17:12 [entrez]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['925151 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.925151 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2020 Oct 6;21:e925151. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.925151.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Durability of remissions and incidence of long-term adverse events are critical factors determining the utility of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, but long-term follow-up of patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells is limited. This work provides the longest follow-up of patients in remission after anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. METHODS: Between 2009 and 2015, we administered 46 CAR T-cell treatments to 43 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00924326). Patients had relapsed B-cell malignancies of the following types: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL/PMBCL; n = 28), low-grade B-cell lymphoma (n = 8), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; n = 7). This report focuses on long-term outcomes of these patients. The CAR used was FMC63-28Z; axicabtagene ciloleucel uses the same CAR. Cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine conditioning chemotherapy was administered before CAR T cells. RESULTS: The percentages of CAR T-cell treatments resulting in a > 3-year duration of response (DOR) were 51% (95% CI, 35% to 67%) for all evaluable treatments, 48% (95% CI, 28% to 69%) for DLBCL/PMBCL, 63% (95% CI, 25% to 92%) for low-grade lymphoma, and 50% (95% CI, 16% to 84%) for CLL. The median event-free survival of all 45 evaluable treatments was 55 months. Long-term adverse effects were rare, except for B-cell depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia. Median peak blood CAR-positive cell levels were higher among patients with a DOR of > 3 years (98/microL; range, 9-1,217/microL) than among patients with a DOR of < 3 years (18/microL; range, 0-308/muL, P = .0051). CONCLUSION: Complete remissions of a variety of B-cell malignancies lasting >/= 3 years occurred after 51% of evaluable anti-CD19 CAR T-cell treatments. Remissions of up to 9 years are ongoing. Late adverse events were rare.","['Cappell, Kathryn M', 'Sherry, Richard M', 'Yang, James C', 'Goff, Stephanie L', 'Vanasse, Danielle A', 'McIntyre, Lori', 'Rosenberg, Steven A', 'Kochenderfer, James N']","['Cappell KM', 'Sherry RM', 'Yang JC', 'Goff SL', 'Vanasse DA', 'McIntyre L', 'Rosenberg SA', 'Kochenderfer JN']",,"['National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Medical Oncology/Hematology Fellowship Program, Bethesda, MD.', 'Surgery Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Istitute, NIH, Bethesda, MD.', 'Surgery Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Istitute, NIH, Bethesda, MD.', 'Surgery Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Istitute, NIH, Bethesda, MD.', 'Surgery Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Istitute, NIH, Bethesda, MD.', 'Surgery Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Istitute, NIH, Bethesda, MD.', 'Surgery Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Istitute, NIH, Bethesda, MD.', 'Surgery Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Istitute, NIH, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201006,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects/*methods', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/blood/immunology', 'Survival Rate']",PMC7655016,,,2020/10/07 06:00,2021/03/24 06:00,['2020/10/06 17:10'],"['2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/06 17:10 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.20.01467 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 Nov 10;38(32):3805-3815. doi: 10.1200/JCO.20.01467.

Initial flow cytometry assays demonstrated peptide ability to induce tumor cell membrane permeabilization and caspase-dependent apoptosis, without total activity reduction by serum proteases up to 24 h (Ctn) and 18 h (Ctn[15-34]). In addition, both Ctn and Ctn[15-34] showed preference for tumor cells rather than healthy cells, with selectivity ratios (tumoral vs healthy cells) of 17 and 7, respectively. Further microscopy and flow cytometry studies suggested their preferential accumulation in the cytoplasmic membrane and nucleus and proposed multiple predominant routes of peptide uptake, including direct entry and endocytosis. Affinity purification followed by proteomic identification experiments revealed both peptides to interact with proteins involved in DNA and protein metabolism, cell cycles, signal transduction, and/or programmed cell death, among others. These results suggest a putative role of Ctn and Ctn[15-34] to interact with key intracellular pathways, ultimately contributing to tumor cell death by necrosis/apoptosis. Altogether, this work proposes a dual mechanism underlying the antitumoral activity of Ctn and Ctn[15-34] and reinforces their potential as future therapeutic drugs.","['Perez-Peinado, Clara', 'Valle, Javier', 'Freire, Joao M', 'Andreu, David']","['Perez-Peinado C', 'Valle J', 'Freire JM', 'Andreu D']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1146-2748', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6317-6666']","['Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona Biomedical Research Park, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona Biomedical Research Park, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Drug Product Development, Janssen Vaccines and Prevention, Newtonweg 1, 2333-CP Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona Biomedical Research Park, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201006,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (crotalicidin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,,2020/10/07 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/10/06 17:10'],"['2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/06 17:10 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.0c00596 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2020 Nov 20;15(11):2945-2957. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.0c00596.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify incident haematological malignancies identified exclusively through the laboratory information system and to measure the impact of that source on the sensitivity and accuracy of registering these malignancies. METHODS: We collected data from the only provincial laboratory of Reggio Emilia on molecular biology, flow cytometry tests and bone marrow smears to detect specific markers of some chronic haematological malignancies. We carried out a record linkage between laboratory reports (period 2013-2017) of patients resident in the province of Reggio Emilia and the Cancer Registry of Reggio Emilia. RESULTS: Of the 303 patients who underwent at least one of these tests, 85 were not included in our Cancer Registry. Of these 85 patients, 42 had received a diagnosis of cancer: 34 myeloproliferative neoplasms, 3 chronic myeloid leukaemias, 3 myelodysplastic neoplasms, 1 multiple myeloma and 1 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We recovered 4.2% of the total number of chronic haemolymphopoietic cancers registered in the study period, accounting for 15% of myeloproliferative neoplasms. For 30% of prelinkage cases, the specificity of the morphological code improved. CONCLUSIONS: Although the laboratory information system's contribution to the completeness of Cancer Registry incident cases was modest, it is useful to add laboratory data to routine cancer registry information flows due to the increasing use of molecular characterisation and to the phenomenon of dehospitalisation.","['Roncaglia, Francesca', 'Mancuso, Pamela', 'Vicentini, Massimo', 'Vitiello, Antonio', 'Vecchia, Luigi', 'Luminari, Stefano', 'Mangone, Lucia', 'Zorzi, Manuel', 'La Vecchia, Carlo', 'Giorgi Rossi, Paolo']","['Roncaglia F', 'Mancuso P', 'Vicentini M', 'Vitiello A', 'Vecchia L', 'Luminari S', 'Mangone L', 'Zorzi M', 'La Vecchia C', 'Giorgi Rossi P']",,"['Epidemiology Unit, Azienda Unita Sanitaria Locale - IRCCS di Reggio Emilia.', ""Laboratory of Medical Statistics, Biometry and Epidemiology 'G.A.

We summarize their results and describe the available models. Additionally, we discuss potential solutions to the hurdles currently limiting CAR technology.

It is an anthracycline antibiotic that inhibits virus multiplication and shows activity against acute leukemia. This drug is either injected into a vein of the subject or typically delivered to cellular nuclei by polymeric or metallic nanoparticles and liposomal or proteinous substrates. The size of these delivering agents becomes a controlling factor affecting the interactions of this drug with nuclear DNA, where it intercalates. The fast-developing area of ultrasmall fluorescent graphene quantum dots (GQDs) provides a new platform for delivering DN, exploiting pi-pi stacking interactions between the planar anthracenyl moiety of the drug and the crystalline GQDs. The size of the GQDs might allow them to transport the medicine inside nuclei easily so that DN can intercalate between the DNA basal planes. Bringing DN close to the DNA duplex is essential, since the daunosamine residue of the drug binds to the minor groove, easing the intercalation of the anthracenyl moiety. The presented experimental analysis uses a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism to provide the details of the dynamics of the delivery of DN by GQDs and its subsequent uptake by the DNA duplex. The process is seen to be governed by differences in the binding constants and the non-interaction of the GQDs with DNA. This research provides vital input into understanding the mechanism of action of DN in greater detail, aiding its applicability in medical science.","['Sinha, Riya', 'Purkayastha, Pradipta']","['Sinha R', 'Purkayastha P']",,"['Department of Chemical Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata, Mohanpur 741246, WB, India. ppurkayastha@iiserkol.ac.in.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201006,England,J Mater Chem B,Journal of materials chemistry.

Here, we use high-throughput chromosome conformation enhancer capture to interrogate the role of enhancer-to-enhancer interactions during differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells. We find that enhancers form an elaborate network that is dynamic during differentiation and coupled with changes in enhancer activity. Transcription factors (TFs) at baited enhancers amplify TF binding at target enhancers, a phenomenon we term cross-interaction stabilization of TFs. Moreover, highly interconnected enhancers (HICE) act as integration hubs orchestrating differentiation by the formation of three-dimensional enhancer communities, inside which, HICE, and other enhancers, converge on phenotypically important gene promoters. Collectively, these results indicate that enhancer interactions play a key role in the regulation of enhancer function, and that HICE are important for both signal integration and compartmentalization of the genome.","['Madsen, Jesper G S', 'Madsen, Maria S', 'Rauch, Alexander', 'Traynor, Sofie', 'Van Hauwaert, Elvira L', 'Haakonsson, Anders K', 'Javierre, Biola M', 'Hyldahl, Mette', 'Fraser, Peter', 'Mandrup, Susanne']","['Madsen JGS', 'Madsen MS', 'Rauch A', 'Traynor S', 'Van Hauwaert EL', 'Haakonsson AK', 'Javierre BM', 'Hyldahl M', 'Fraser P', 'Mandrup S']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0518-0800', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5039-340X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9429-7356', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5076-3730', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7407-6062', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0041-1227', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0961-5787']","['Functional Genomics & Metabolism Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Functional Genomics & Metabolism Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Functional Genomics & Metabolism Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Molecular Endocrinology & Stem Cell Research Unit, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Steno Diabetes Center Odense, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Functional Genomics & Metabolism Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Cancer and Inflammation Research, Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Functional Genomics & Metabolism Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Functional Genomics & Metabolism Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Open Patient Data Explorative Network, Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Nuclear Dynamics Programme, Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Campus ICO-Germans Trias I Pujol, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Functional Genomics & Metabolism Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Nuclear Dynamics Programme, Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Biological Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA.', 'Functional Genomics & Metabolism Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark. s.mandrup@bmb.sdu.dk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201005,United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['Adipocytes/cytology', 'Adipogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Osteoblasts/cytology', 'Osteogenesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,,,2020/10/07 06:00,2020/12/30 06:00,['2020/10/06 05:32'],"['2019/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/06 05:32 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41588-020-0709-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41588-020-0709-z [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2020 Nov;52(11):1227-1238. doi: 10.1038/s41588-020-0709-z.

Despite impressive outcomes, relapse with CD19(-) disease remains a challenge. We address this limitation through a first-in-human trial of bispecific anti-CD20, anti-CD19 (LV20.19) CAR T cells for relapsed, refractory B cell malignancies. Adult patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia were treated on a phase 1 dose escalation and expansion trial (NCT03019055) to evaluate the safety of 4-1BB-CD3zeta LV20.19 CAR T cells and the feasibility of on-site manufacturing using the CliniMACS Prodigy system. CAR T cell doses ranged from 2.5 x 10(5)-2.5 x 10(6) cells per kg. Cell manufacturing was set at 14 d with the goal of infusing non-cryopreserved LV20.19 CAR T cells. The target dose of LV20.19 CAR T cells was met in all CAR-naive patients, and 22 patients received LV20.19 CAR T cells on protocol. In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity, a dose of 2.5 x 10(6) cells per kg was chosen for expansion. Grade 3-4 cytokine release syndrome occurred in one (5%) patient, and grade 3-4 neurotoxicity occurred in three (14%) patients. Eighteen (82%) patients achieved an overall response at day 28, 14 (64%) had a complete response, and 4 (18%) had a partial response. The overall response rate to the dose of 2.5 x 10(6) cells per kg with non-cryopreserved infusion (n = 12) was 100% (complete response, 92%; partial response, 8%). Notably, loss of the CD19 antigen was not seen in patients who relapsed or experienced treatment failure. In conclusion, on-site manufacturing and infusion of non-cryopreserved LV20.19 CAR T cells were feasible and therapeutically safe, showing low toxicity and high efficacy. Bispecific CARs may improve clinical responses by mitigating target antigen downregulation as a mechanism of relapse.","['Shah, Nirav N', 'Johnson, Bryon D', 'Schneider, Dina', 'Zhu, Fenlu', 'Szabo, Aniko', 'Keever-Taylor, Carolyn A', 'Krueger, Winfried', 'Worden, Andrew A', 'Kadan, Michael J', 'Yim, Sharon', 'Cunningham, Ashley', 'Hamadani, Mehdi', 'Fenske, Timothy S', 'Dropulic, Boro', 'Orentas, Rimas', 'Hari, Parameswaran']","['Shah NN', 'Johnson BD', 'Schneider D', 'Zhu F', 'Szabo A', 'Keever-Taylor CA', 'Krueger W', 'Worden AA', 'Kadan MJ', 'Yim S', 'Cunningham A', 'Hamadani M', 'Fenske TS', 'Dropulic B', 'Orentas R', 'Hari P']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4336-1071', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8129-0614', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3085-6876', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6442-1320', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5372-510X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3861-7677']","['BMT & Cellular Therapy Program, Division of Hematology & Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA. nishah@mcw.edu.', 'BMT & Cellular Therapy Program, Division of Hematology & Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Lentigen, a Miltenyi Biotec company, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', 'BMT & Cellular Therapy Program, Division of Hematology & Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'BMT & Cellular Therapy Program, Division of Hematology & Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Lentigen, a Miltenyi Biotec company, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', 'Lentigen, a Miltenyi Biotec company, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', 'Lentigen, a Miltenyi Biotec company, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', 'BMT & Cellular Therapy Program, Division of Hematology & Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'BMT & Cellular Therapy Program, Division of Hematology & Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'BMT & Cellular Therapy Program, Division of Hematology & Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Lentigen, a Miltenyi Biotec company, Gaithersburg, MD, USA. boro.dropulic@miltenyi.com.', 'Lentigen, a Miltenyi Biotec company, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'BMT & Cellular Therapy Program, Division of Hematology & Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201005,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism/transplantation']",,,,2020/10/07 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/10/06 05:32'],"['2020/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/06 05:32 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41591-020-1081-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41591-020-1081-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2020 Oct;26(10):1569-1575. doi: 10.1038/s41591-020-1081-3.

For intermediate cytogenetic risk AML transplanted in first complete remission (CR1), multivariate analysis revealed that haplo-TBF significantly increased nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (HR 2.1; p = 0.0006) but did not affect relapse incidence (RI), leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), or graft-versus-host disease-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS). For high cytogenetic risk AML transplanted in CR1, haplo-TBF significantly increased NRM (HR = 2.7; p = 0.02), decreased RI (HR = 0.45; p = 0.03) but had no influence on LFS, OS, or GRFS.

Finally, for AML patients transplanted with active disease, haplo-TBF had no influence on transplant outcomes. In conclusion, compared to MUD-FB, haplo-TBF increased NRM, reduced RI in high-risk AML in CR, resulting in similar LFS, OS, and GRFS. These results comparing two different approaches support the use of a haploidentical family donor for high-risk AML patients lacking a matched sibling donor.","['Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Forcade, Edouard', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Berceanu, Ana', 'Angelucci, Emanuele', 'Bulabois, Claude Eric', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Ceballos, Patrice', 'Mielke, Stephan', 'El Cheikh, Jean', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Savani, Bipin', 'Spyridonidis, Alexandros', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Bazarbachi A', 'Labopin M', 'Blaise D', 'Forcade E', 'Socie G', 'Berceanu A', 'Angelucci E', 'Bulabois CE', 'Kroger N', 'Rambaldi A', 'Ceballos P', 'Mielke S', 'El Cheikh J', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Savani B', 'Spyridonidis A', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7171-4997', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4514-4748', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5684-9447', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2114-7533', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6512-6080', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2961-4183', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3739-7502', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8325-9215', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2846-9428', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3097-2532']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon. bazarbac@aub.edu.lb.', 'Department of Haematology and EBMT Paris Study Office/CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, INSERM UMR 938, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Programme de Transplantation & Therapie Cellulaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', ""CHU Bordeaux, service d'hematologie et therapie Cellulaire, F-33000, Bordeaux, France."", 'Department of Hematology-BMT, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Jean Minjoz, Besancon, France."", 'Hematology and Transplant Center, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', ""Service d'Hematologie, CHU Grenoble Alpes-Universite Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France."", 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Centre, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', ""Departement d'Hematologie Clinique, 11 CHU Saint Eloi, Unite de Greffes Hematologiques, Montpellier, France."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, CAST, Karolinska Institutet and University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'CHU Lille, Univ Lille, INSERM, Infinite, U1286, F-59000, Lille, France.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, BMT Unit, University Hospital of Patras, Patras, Greece.', 'Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel HaShomer, Israel.', 'Department of Haematology and EBMT Paris Study Office/CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, INSERM UMR 938, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France. mohamad.mohty@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201006,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Busulfan/therapeutic use', '*Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thiotepa', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical', 'Unrelated Donors', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives']",,,,2020/10/07 06:00,2021/07/06 06:00,['2020/10/06 05:30'],"['2020/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/06 05:30 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-01074-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-01074-z [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2021 Mar;56(3):622-634. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-01074-z.

The effects of the well-tolerated alkaloid Berberine (BRB), used for treating metabolic disorders, were studied on ex-vivo leukemic cells activated in vitro by microenvironment stimuli. BRB decreased expression of survival/proliferation-associated molecules (e.g. Mcl-1/Bcl-xL) and inhibited stimulation-induced cell cycle entry, irrespective of TP53 alterations or chromosomal abnormalities. CLL cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation for their bioenergetics, particularly during the activation process. In this context, BRB triggered mitochondrial dysfunction and aberrant cellular energetic metabolism. Decreased ATP production and NADH recycling, associated with mitochondrial uncoupling, were not compensated by increased lactic fermentation. Antioxidant defenses were affected and could not correct the altered intracellular redox homeostasis. The data thus indicated that the cytotoxic/cytostatic action of BRB at 10-30 muM might be mediated, at least in part, by BRB-induced impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and the associated increment of oxidative damage, with consequent inhibition of cell activation and eventual cell death. Bioenergetics and cell survival were instead unaffected in normal B lymphocytes at the same BRB concentrations. Interestingly, BRB lowered the apoptotic threshold of ABT-199/Venetoclax, a promising BH3-mimetic whose cytotoxic activity is counteracted by high Mcl-1/Bcl-xL expression and increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Our results indicate that, while CLL cells are in the process of building their survival and cycling armamentarium, the presence of BRB affects this process.","['Ravera, Silvia', 'Ghiotto, Fabio', 'Tenca, Claudya', 'Gugiatti, Elena', 'Santamaria, Sara', 'Ledda, Bernardetta', 'Ibatici, Adalberto', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Mazzarello, Andrea N', 'Bagnara, Davide', 'Cardillo, Martina', 'Zarcone, Daniela', 'Darzynkiewicz, Zbigniew', 'Ciccone, Ermanno', 'Fais, Franco', 'Bruno, Silvia']","['Ravera S', 'Ghiotto F', 'Tenca C', 'Gugiatti E', 'Santamaria S', 'Ledda B', 'Ibatici A', 'Cutrona G', 'Mazzarello AN', 'Bagnara D', 'Cardillo M', 'Zarcone D', 'Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Ciccone E', 'Fais F', 'Bruno S']",,"['Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit and Bone Marrow Transplantation, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Experimental Immunology, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-Long Island, Manhasset, NY, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology, Brander Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, 16132, Genoa, Italy. silvia.bruno@unige.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201005,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0I8Y3P32UF (Berberine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Berberine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Patients', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",PMC7536443,,,2020/10/07 06:00,2021/01/23 06:00,['2020/10/06 05:29'],"['2020/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/06 05:29 [entrez]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-73594-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-73594-z [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Oct 5;10(1):16519. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-73594-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we monitor mitochondrial membrane potential of single lymphocytic leukemia cells and demonstrate that mitochondria hyperpolarize from the G2/M transition until the metaphase-anaphase transition. This hyperpolarization was dependent on cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity. By using an electrical circuit model of mitochondria, we quantify mitochondrial ATP synthesis rates in mitosis from the single-cell time-dynamics of mitochondrial membrane potential. We find that mitochondrial ATP synthesis decreases by approximately 50% during early mitosis and increases back to G2 levels during cytokinesis. Consistently, ATP levels and ATP synthesis are lower in mitosis than in G2 in synchronized cell populations. Overall, our results provide insights into mitotic bioenergetics and suggest that cell division is not a highly energy demanding process.","['Kang, Joon Ho', 'Katsikis, Georgios', 'Li, Zhaoqi', 'Sapp,

Because of numerous fusion partners, the mutational landscape and prognostic impact of specific 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements are not fully understood. We analyzed clinical features of 172 adults with AML and recurrent 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements, 141 of whom had outcome data available. We compared outcomes of these patients with outcomes of 1,097 patients without an 11q23/KMT2A rearrangement categorized according to the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) classification. Using targeted next-generation sequencing, we investigated the mutational status of 81 leukemia/cancer-associated genes in 96 patients with 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements with material for molecular studies available. Patients with 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements had a low number of additional gene mutations (median, 1; range 0 to 6), which involved the RAS pathway (KRAS, NRAS, and PTPN11) in 32% of patients. KRAS mutations occurred more often in patients with t(6;11)(q27;q23)/KMT2A-AFDN compared with patients with the other 11q23/KMT2A subsets. Specific gene mutations were too infrequent in patients with specific 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements to assess their associations with outcomes. We demonstrate that younger (age <60 y) patients with t(9;11)(p22;q23)/KMT2A-MLLT3 had better outcomes than patients with other 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements and those without 11q23/KMT2A rearrangements classified in the 2017 ELN intermediate-risk group. Conversely, outcomes of older patients (age >/=60 y) with t(9;11)(p22;q23) were poor and comparable to those of the ELN adverse-risk group patients. Our study shows that patients with an 11q23/KMT2A rearrangement have distinct mutational patterns and outcomes depending on the fusion partner.","['Bill, Marius', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin', 'Walker, Christopher J', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Papaioannou, Dimitrios', 'Blachly, James S', 'Orwick, Shelley', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Stone, Richard M', 'de la Chapelle, Albert', 'Byrd, John C', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Bill M', 'Mrozek K', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Walker CJ', 'Nicolet D', 'Papaioannou D', 'Blachly JS', 'Orwick S', 'Carroll AJ', 'Kolitz JE', 'Powell BL', 'Stone RM', 'de la Chapelle A', 'Byrd JC', 'Bloomfield CD']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4537-1409', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9345-9248']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210; marius.bill@osumc.edu krzysztof.mrozek@osumc.edu Albert.delaChapelle@osumc.edu.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210; marius.bill@osumc.edu krzysztof.mrozek@osumc.edu Albert.delaChapelle@osumc.edu.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Statistics and Data Center, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Statistics and Data Center, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294.', 'Northwell Health Cancer Institute, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Lake Success, NY 11042.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section on Hematology & Oncology, Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Winston-Salem, NC 27157.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care, Boston, MA 02215.', 'Human Cancer Genetics Program, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; marius.bill@osumc.edu krzysztof.mrozek@osumc.edu Albert.delaChapelle@osumc.edu.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201005,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jacobsen Distal 11q Deletion Syndrome/*genetics/metabolism', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC7584992,['NOTNLM'],"['*KMT2A', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*clinical outcome', '*gene mutations', '*next-generation sequencing']",2020/10/07 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/10/06 05:26'],"['2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/06 05:26 [entrez]']","['2014732117 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.2014732117 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Oct 20;117(42):26340-26346. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2014732117.

Current therapeutic options for treating these diseases include antiangiogenic strategies that can lead to the undesirable inhibition of normal vascular development. Therefore, strategies that eliminate pathological neovascular tufts while sparing normal blood vessels are needed. In this study we exploited the hyaloid vascular network in murine eyes, which naturally undergoes regression after birth, to gain mechanistic insights that could be therapeutically adapted for driving neovessel regression in ocular diseases. We found that endothelial cells of regressing hyaloid vessels underwent down-regulation of two structurally related E-26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factors, ETS-related gene (ERG) and Friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI1), prior to apoptosis. Moreover, the small molecule YK-4-279, which inhibits the transcriptional and biological activity of ETS factors, enhanced hyaloid regression in vivo and drove Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) tube regression and apoptosis in vitro. Importantly, exposure of HUVECs to sheer stress inhibited YK-4-279-induced apoptosis, indicating that low-flow vessels may be uniquely susceptible to YK-4-279-mediated regression. We tested this hypothesis by administering YK-4-279 to mice in an oxygen-induced retinopathy model that generates disorganized and poorly perfused neovascular tufts that mimic human ocular diseases. YK-4-279 treatment significantly reduced neovascular tufts while sparing healthy retinal vessels, thereby demonstrating the therapeutic potential of this inhibitor.","['Schafer, Christopher M', 'Gurley, Jami M', 'Kurylowicz, Katarzyna', 'Lin, Prisca K', 'Chen, Wen', 'Elliott, Michael H', 'Davis, George E', 'Bhatti, Faizah', 'Griffin, Courtney T']","['Schafer CM', 'Gurley JM', 'Kurylowicz K', 'Lin PK', 'Chen W', 'Elliott MH', 'Davis GE', 'Bhatti F', 'Griffin CT']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5859-7714', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7919-9328', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1456-8097', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2289-8718', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1549-1610', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8100-3171']","['Cardiovascular Biology Research Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Dean McGee Eye Institute, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Cardiovascular Biology Research Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida School of Medicine, Tampa, FL 33612.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Dean McGee Eye Institute, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Dean McGee Eye Institute, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida School of Medicine, Tampa, FL 33612.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Dean McGee Eye Institute, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Neonatal Perinatal Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.', 'Cardiovascular Biology Research Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK 73104; courtney-griffin@omrf.org.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201005,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (ERG protein, mouse)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', '0 (YK 4-279)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blood Vessels/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism', 'Eye/*blood supply', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Retinal Vessels/pathology', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG/*metabolism']",PMC7584886,['NOTNLM'],"['*ERG', '*FLI1', '*YK-4-279', '*hyaloid vessels', '*oxygen-induced retinopathy']",2020/10/07 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/10/06 05:26'],"['2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/06 05:26 [entrez]']","['2015980117 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.2015980117 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Oct 20;117(42):26494-26502. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2015980117.

The essential splicing factor U2AF2 recognizes a polypyrimidine-tract splice-site signal and initiates spliceosome assembly. Here, we investigate representative, acquired U2AF2 mutations, namely N196K or G301D amino acid substitutions associated with leukemia or solid tumors, respectively. We determined crystal structures of the wild-type (WT) compared with N196K- or G301D-substituted U2AF2 proteins, each bound to a prototypical AdML polypyrimidine tract, at 1.5, 1.4, or 1.7 A resolutions. The N196K residue appears to stabilize the open conformation of U2AF2 with an inter-RNA recognition motif hydrogen bond, in agreement with an increased apparent RNA-binding affinity of the N196K-substituted protein. The G301D residue remains in a similar position as the WT residue, where unfavorable proximity to the RNA phosphodiester could explain the decreased RNA-binding affinity of the G301D-substituted protein. We found that expression of the G301D-substituted U2AF2 protein reduces splicing of a minigene transcript carrying prototypical splice sites. We further show that expression of either N196K- or G301D-substituted U2AF2 can subtly alter splicing of representative endogenous transcripts, despite the presence of endogenous, WT U2AF2 such as would be present in cancer cells. Altogether, our results demonstrate that acquired U2AF2 mutations such as N196K and G301D are capable of dysregulating gene expression for neoplastic transformation.","['Maji, Debanjana', 'Glasser, Eliezra', 'Henderson, Steven', 'Galardi, Justin', 'Pulvino, Mary J', 'Jenkins, Jermaine L', 'Kielkopf, Clara L']","['Maji D', 'Glasser E', 'Henderson S', 'Galardi J', 'Pulvino MJ', 'Jenkins JL', 'Kielkopf CL']",,"['Center for RNA Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, USA.', 'Center for RNA Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, USA.', 'Center for RNA Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, USA.', 'Center for RNA Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, USA.', 'Center for RNA Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, USA.', 'Center for RNA Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, USA.', 'Center for RNA Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York, USA.

The multifunctional properties of these cells are being investigated in many studies. The current research examined the influence of MSCs on the Molt-4 cell line as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. METHODS: MSCs were cultured, characterized, and co-cultured with Molt-4 cells in a trans-well system. Then, cultured Molt-4 alone and Molt-4 co-cultured with MSCs (10:1) were collected on day 7 and subjected to western blotting for protein expression assessment. Telomerase activity as well as cell senescence, were investigated by PCR-ELISA TRAP assay and beta-galactosidase activity measurement, respectively. RESULTS: It was found that MSCs resulted in a significant increase in the pro-caspase-8 and cleaved-caspase 8 and 9 expression levels. Furthermore, protein expression levels of GSK-3alpha/beta and ERK1/2 were significantly decreased. The results also showed that MSCs caused significant decreases and increases in telomerase and beta-galactosidase enzyme activity of Molt-4 cells, respectively. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that MSCs co-cultured with Molt-4 cells could be involved in the promotion of Molt-4 cell apoptosis and cell senescence via caspase-8, 9 cascade and GSK-3alpha/beta and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.","['Fathi, Ezzatollah', 'Vietor, Ilja']","['Fathi E', 'Vietor I']",,"['Department of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Institute of Cell Biology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Biocenter, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Gene Ther,Current gene therapy,101125446,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Caspase 9/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/*methods', 'Coculture Techniques', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*GSK-3alpha/beta and ERK1/2 signaling pathways', '*Mesenchymal stem cells', '*apoptosis', '*caspase 8 and 9', '*stem cell-based therapy']",2020/10/07 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/10/06 05:23'],"['2020/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/06 05:23 [entrez]']","['CGT-EPUB-110435 [pii]', '10.2174/1566523220666201005111126 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Gene Ther. 2021;21(1):81-88. doi: 10.2174/1566523220666201005111126.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate if broad metabolic aberrations may result from IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in AML, plasma metabolomics was conducted by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on 51 AML patients, 29 IDH1/2 wild-type (WT), 9 with IDH1R132, 12 with IDH2R140 and one with IDH2R172 mutations. Distinct metabolic differences were observed between IDH1/2 WT, IDH1R132 and IDH2R140 patients that comprised 22 plasma metabolites that were mainly amino acids. Only two plasma metabolites were statistically significantly different (p < 0.0001) between both IDH1R132 and WT IDH1/2 and IDH2R140 and WT IDH1/2, specifically (2R)-hydroxyglutaric acid (2R-HG) and the threonine metabolite (2R,3S)-dihydroxybutanoic acid (2,3-DHBA). Moreover, 2R-HG correlated strongly (p < 0.0001) with 2,3-DHBA in plasma. One WT patient was discovered to have a D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2HGDH) A426T inactivating mutation but this had little influence on 2R-HG and 2,3-DHBA plasma concentrations. Expression of transporter genes SLC16A1 and SLC16A3 displayed a weak correlation with 2R-HG but not 2,3-DHBA plasma concentrations. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that 2,3-DHBA was a better biomarker for IDH mutation than 2R-HG (Area under the curve (AUC) 0.861; p < 0.0001; 80% specificity; 87.3% sensitivity). It was concluded that 2,3-DHBA and 2R-HG are both formed by mutant IDH1R132, IDH2R140 and IDH2R172, suggesting a potential role of 2,3-DHBA in AML pathogenesis.","['Idle, Jeffrey R', 'Seipel, Katja', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Pabst, Thomas', 'Beyoglu, Diren']","['Idle JR', 'Seipel K', 'Bacher U', 'Pabst T', 'Beyoglu D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6143-1520', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3128-1573', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8771-947X']","[""Arthur G.

The current AML diagnostic method, a manual examination of the peripheral blood smear, is time consuming, labor intensive, and suffers from considerable inter-observer variation. Herein, a machine learning model to detect and classify immature leukocytes for efficient diagnosis of AML is presented. Images of leukocytes in AML patients and healthy controls were obtained from a publicly available dataset in The Cancer Imaging Archive. Image format conversion, multi-Otsu thresholding, and morphological operations were used for segmentation of the nucleus and cytoplasm. From each image, 16 features were extracted, two of which are new nucleus color features proposed in this study. A random forest algorithm was trained for the detection and classification of immature leukocytes. The model achieved 92.99% accuracy for detection and 93.45% accuracy for classification of immature leukocytes into four types. Precision values for each class were above 65%, which is an improvement on the current state of art. Based on Gini importance, the nucleus to cytoplasm area ratio was a discriminative feature for both detection and classification, while the two proposed features were shown to be significant for classification. The proposed model can be used as a support tool for the diagnosis of AML, and the features calculated to be most important serve as a baseline for future research.","['Dasariraju, Satvik', 'Huo, Marc', 'McCalla, Serena']","['Dasariraju S', 'Huo M', 'McCalla S']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8132-598X'],"['iResearch Institute, Glen Cove, NY 11542, USA.', 'The Lawrenceville School, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648, USA.', 'iResearch Institute, Glen Cove, NY 11542, USA.', 'School of Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'iResearch Institute, Glen Cove, NY 11542, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201001,Switzerland,Bioengineering (Basel),"Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",101676056,,,,PMC7711527,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'computer-aided diagnosis', 'cytomorphology', 'feature importance', 'immature leukocyte', 'machine learning', 'peripheral blood smear', 'random forest', 'segmentation']",2020/10/07 06:00,2020/10/07 06:01,['2020/10/06 01:07'],"['2020/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/06 01:07 [entrez]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/07 06:01 [medline]']","['bioengineering7040120 [pii]', '10.3390/bioengineering7040120 [doi]']",epublish,Bioengineering (Basel). 2020 Oct 1;7(4). pii: bioengineering7040120. doi: 10.3390/bioengineering7040120.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we report an AML patient resembling APL but with nucleoporin 98/retinoid acid receptor gamma gene (NUP98/RARG) fusion transcript and Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) mutation. PATIENT CONCERNS: An 18-year-old male presented at the hospital with a diagnosis of AML. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with bone marrow examination. Bone marrow smear displayed 90.5% promyelocytes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis failed to detect the PML/RARalpha fusion transcript or RARalpha amplification. While real-time polymerase chain reaction showed positivity for the NUP98/RARG fusion transcript. G-banding karyotype analysis showed a normal karyotype. INTERVENTIONS: The patient showed resistance to arsenic trioxide and standard 3 + 7 chemotherapy, but eventually achieved complete remission through the Homoharringtonine, Cytarabine, and Aclarubicin chemotherapy.

The implementation of measurable residual disease (MRD) using flow cytometry (FC) is highly effective but the interpretation is time-consuming and suffers from physician idiosyncrasy. Recent machine learning algorithms have been proposed to automatically classify acute leukemia samples with and without MRD to address this clinical need. However, most prior works either validate only on a small data cohort or focus on one specific type of leukemia which lacks generalization. In this work, we propose a transfer learning approach in performing automatic MRD classification that takes advantage of a large scale acute myeloid leukemia (AML) database to facilitate better learning on a small cohort of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Specifically, we develop a knowledge-reserved distilled AML pre-trained network with ALL complementary learning to enhance the ALL MRD classification. Our framework achieves 84.5% averaged AUC which shows its transferability across acute leukemia, and our further analysis reveals that younger and elder ALL patient samples benefit more from using the pre-trained AML model.","['Li, Jeng-Lin', 'Chang, Ting-Yu', 'Wang, Yu-Fen', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Lee, Chi-Chun']","['Li JL', 'Chang TY', 'Wang YF', 'Ko BS', 'Tang JL', 'Lee CC']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

Materials and Methods: Data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry were used to calculate percent distributions, age-specific incidence rates, age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) per million, annual percent changes (APCs), average APCs, and RSRs for cancers diagnosed in AYAs. RESULTS: ASR of all cancers among AYAs was 654.5 per million. The largest diagnosed group of cancers was carcinomas (almost 80%). Crude incidence increased with age, from 170.4 per million for those aged 15-19 years to 1,639.8 per million for those aged 35-39 years. ASR increased from 414.8 per million to 820.4 per million, with an APC of 9.0%. The incidence of thyroid carcinoma showed the most rapid increment (APC, 14.0%), followed by non-Hodgkin lymphoma (APC, 13.4%). The 5-year RSR among AYAs significantly improved from 62.1% to 90.8%. Survival improvement in AYAs was higher than that in children but lower than that in older adults (APC, 2.1% vs. 1.9% vs. 3.1%). The most marked survival improvement was found for leukemia and lymphoma. Astrocytoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and carcinoma of the trachea, bronchus, and lung had a 5-year RSR of < 50%. CONCLUSION: There was an improvement in cancer survivals in AYAs, comparable to that achieved in children. However, survivals in several cancer types do not appear to be improving. Further research focusing on the epidemiology and therapeutic strategies for cancers in AYAs is needed.","['Park, Meerim', 'Lim, Jiwon', 'Lee, Jun Ah', 'Park, Byung Kiu', 'Jung, Kyu-Won', 'Won, Young-Joo', 'Park, Hyeon Jin']","['Park M', 'Lim J', 'Lee JA', 'Park BK', 'Jung KW', 'Won YJ', 'Park HJ']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Division of Cancer Registration and Surveillance, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Division of Cancer Registration and Surveillance, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Division of Cancer Registration and Surveillance, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20201005,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,,IM,"['Female', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Republic of Korea', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC7811995,['NOTNLM'],"['Adolescent and young adult', 'Incidence', 'Korea', 'Neoplasms', 'Survival']",2020/10/06 06:00,2021/08/31 06:00,['2020/10/05 21:38'],"['2020/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/05 21:38 [entrez]']","['crt.2020.644 [pii]', '10.4143/crt.2020.644 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2021 Jan;53(1):32-44. doi: 10.4143/crt.2020.644.

Here, we present a narrative review of epidemiological evidence of the risk of lymphoma, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM), among various exposed populations including atomic bombing survivors, industrial and medical radiation workers and individuals exposed for medical purposes. Overall, there is a suggestion of a positive dose dependent association between radiation exposure and lymphoma. The magnitude of this association is highly imprecise, however, with wide confidence intervals frequently including zero risk. External comparisons tend to show similar incidence and mortality rates to the general population. Currently, there is insufficient information on the impact of age-at-exposure, high versus low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, external versus internal or acute versus chronic exposures. Associations are stronger for males than females, and stronger for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and MM than for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), while the risk of radiation induced CLL may be non-existent. This broad grouping of diverse diseases could potentially obscure stronger associations for certain subtypes, each with a different cell-of-origin. Additionally, the classification of malignancies as leukaemia or lymphoma may result in similar diseases being analysed separately while distinct diseases are analysed in the same category. Uncertainty in cell-of-origin means the appropriate organ for dose response analysis is unclear. Further uncertainties arise from potential confounding or bias due to infectious causes and immunosuppression. The potential interaction between radiation and other risk factors is unknown. Combined, these uncertainties make lymphoma perhaps the most challenging malignancy to study in radiation epidemiology.","['Harbron, Richard W', 'Pasqual, Elisa']","['Harbron RW', 'Pasqual E']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6073-2850'],"['Population Health Sciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND.', 'Barcelona Institute for Global Health, Barcelona, Catalunya, SPAIN.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201005,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'Epidemiology', 'Ionising radiation', 'Lymphoma', 'Multiple myeloma']",2020/10/06 06:00,2020/10/06 06:00,['2020/10/05 20:11'],"['2020/10/05 20:11 [entrez]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1088/1361-6498/abbe37 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Radiol Prot. 2020 Oct 5. doi: 10.1088/1361-6498/abbe37.,['Creative Commons Attribution license.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The splice factor kinase SRPK1 drives the activity of oncogenic splice factors such as SRSF1. SRSF1 in turn promotes the expression of splice isoforms that favour tumour growth, including proangiogenic VEGF. Knockdown (with siRNA) or chemical inhibition (using SPHINX) of SRPK1 in K562 leukemia and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines reduced cell proliferation, invasion and migration. In glomerular podocytes, the Wilms tumour suppressor zinc-finger transcription factor WT1 represses SRPK1 transcription. Here we show that in cancer cells WT1 activates SRPK1 transcription, unless a canonical WT1 binding site adjacent to the transcription start site is mutated. The ability of WT1 to activate SRPK1 transcription was reversed by the transcriptional corepressor BASP1, and both WT1 and BASP1 co-precipitated with the SRPK1 promoter. BASP1 significantly increased the expression of the antiangiogenic VEGF165b splice isoform. We propose that by upregulating SRPK1 transcription WT1 can direct an alternative splicing landscape that facilitates tumour growth.","['Belali, Tareg', 'Wodi, Chigeru', 'Clark, Bethany', 'Cheung, Man-Kim', 'Craig, Tim J', 'Wheway, Gabrielle', 'Wagner, Nicole', 'Wagner, Kay-Dietrich', 'Roberts, Stefan', 'Porazinski, Sean', 'Ladomery, Michael']","['Belali T', 'Wodi C', 'Clark B', 'Cheung MK', 'Craig TJ', 'Wheway G', 'Wagner N', 'Wagner KD', 'Roberts S', 'Porazinski S', 'Ladomery M']",,"['Centre for Research in Bioscience, Faculty of Health and Applied Sciences, University of the West of England, Coldharbour Lane, Frenchay, Bristol BS16 1QY, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Research in Bioscience, Faculty of Health and Applied Sciences, University of the West of England, Coldharbour Lane, Frenchay, Bristol BS16 1QY, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Research in Bioscience, Faculty of Health and Applied Sciences, University of the West of England, Coldharbour Lane, Frenchay, Bristol BS16 1QY, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Research in Bioscience, Faculty of Health and Applied Sciences, University of the West of England, Coldharbour Lane, Frenchay, Bristol BS16 1QY, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Research in Bioscience, Faculty of Health and Applied Sciences, University of the West of England, Coldharbour Lane, Frenchay, Bristol BS16 1QY, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Research in Bioscience, Faculty of Health and Applied Sciences, University of the West of England, Coldharbour Lane, Frenchay, Bristol BS16 1QY, United Kingdom.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS, INSERM, iBV, 06107 Nice, France."", ""Universite Cote d'Azur, CNRS, INSERM, iBV, 06107 Nice, France."", 'Biomedical Sciences Building, University of Bristol, University Walk, Clifton, Bristol BS8 1TD, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Research in Bioscience, Faculty of Health and Applied Sciences, University of the West of England, Coldharbour Lane, Frenchay, Bristol BS16 1QY, United Kingdom.

Quizartinib, a once-daily oral, highly potent, and selective FLT3 inhibitor, significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) and improved clinical benefit compared with salvage chemotherapy (median OS, 6.2 months versus 4.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], .76; 95% confidence interval [CI], .58 to .98; P = .018; composite complete remission [CRc] rate, 48% versus 27%; median duration of CRc, 2.8 months versus 1.2 months; mortality rate, .8% versus 14% by day 30, 7% versus 24% by day 60) in patients with R/R FLT3-ITD AML in the phase 3 QuANTUM-R trial. In this post hoc analysis, we described the characteristics of and clinical outcomes in patients who underwent on-study HSCT in QuANTUM-R at the investigator's discretion and institutional practices. Of 367 randomized patients, 78 (32%) in the quizartinib arm and 14 (11%) in the salvage chemotherapy arm underwent on-study allo-HSCT without any intervening therapy for AML after quizartinib or study-specified salvage chemotherapy. Pooled data of patients from both treatment arms showed a longer median overall survival (OS) in transplant recipients versus those treated without allo-HSCT (12.2 months versus 4.4 months; HR, .315; 95% CI, .233 to .427). Pooled data also showed a longer median OS in patients with a last recorded response of CRc before allo-HSCT versus patients without a CRc (20.1 months versus 8.8 months; HR, .506; 95% CI, .296 to .864). By treatment arm, the median OS was 25.1 months with quizartinib and 20.1 months with salvage chemotherapy in patients with a last recorded response of CRc before allo-HSCT. Forty-eight patients in the quizartinib arm continued quizartinib treatment after allo-HSCT. In the 31 patients with a last recorded response of CRc before allo-HSCT who continued quizartinib after allo-HSCT, the median OS was 27.1 months. Continuation of quizartinib after allo-HSCT was tolerable, and no new safety signals were identified. These results suggest that post-transplantation survival following salvage chemotherapy and quizartinib treatment are similar. However, quizartinib response occurs more frequently than with salvage chemotherapy, potentially allowing more patients to undergo transplantation and achieve durable clinical benefit. In addition, post-transplant quizartinib was found to be tolerable and may be associated with prolonged survival in some patients, highlighting its potential value in the management of patients with FLT3-ITD R/R AML.","['Ganguly, Siddhartha', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kramer, Alwin', 'Levis, Mark J', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Perl, Alexander E', 'Russell, Nigel H', 'Arunachalam, Meena', 'Santos, Cedric Dos', 'Gammon, Guy', 'Lesegretain, Arnaud', 'Mires, Derek E', 'Pham, Hoang', 'Wang, Yibin', 'Khaled, Samer K']","['Ganguly S', 'Cortes JE', 'Kramer A', 'Levis MJ', 'Martinelli G', 'Perl AE', 'Russell NH', 'Arunachalam M', 'Santos CD', 'Gammon G', 'Lesegretain A', 'Mires DE', 'Pham H', 'Wang Y', 'Khaled SK']",,"['Division of Hematological Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics, The University of Kansas Health System, Kansas City, Kansas.

The mechanism of BLV infection in humans and its implication as a primary cause of cancer in women are not known yet. BLV infection in humans may be caused by the consumption of milk and milk-products or meat from infected animals. Breast cancer incidence rates in Brazil are high, corresponding to 29.5% a year of cancer cases among women. In 2020, an estimated 66,280 new cases of breast cancer are expected, whereas in 2018 breast cancer has led to 17,572 deaths, the highest incidence and lethality among cancers in women in this country that year. BLV infection occurrence ranges from 60 to 95% in dairy herds. In addition, there are some regions, such as the Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil, where the population traditionally consume unpasteurized dairy products. Taken together, this study aimed to verify if there is a higher association between breast cancer and the presence of BLV genome in breast tissue samples within this population that consumes raw milk from animals with high rates of BLV infection. A molecular study of two BLV genes was carried out in 88 breast parenchyma samples, between tumors and controls.

Limited information on NTS infections in children is available in China. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of children admitted to the Ningbo Women and Children's Hospital with culture-confirmed NTS infections between January 2012 and December 2019. Clinical and microbiological information were collected. We compared demographic, clinical and antibiotic resistance variables of invasive NTS (iNTS) infections and non-invasive NTS (non-iNTS) infections, and explored associations between hospitalizations for pediatric NTS infections and temperature and rainfall. RESULTS: A total of 166 pediatric hospitalizations due to NTS infection were identified during the 8-year study period. Most of the 166 children were <5 years old (93.4%). The primary serotype was Salmonella Typhimurium (62.6%). Of 166 children with NTS infections, 11 had invasive infection. Compared to 155 children with non-iNTS infections, we found that iNTS infections were more likely to occur in infants </=6 months or children with an underlying medical condition of leukemia at admission, but iNTS infections less often presented with a symptom of diarrhea (P <0.05 in all cases). The resistance rates of non-iNTS isolates to ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefepime, and aztreonam were significantly higher than those of iNTS isolates (P <0.05 in all cases). In addition, compared with iNTS isolates, non-iNTS isolates were significantly associated with resistance to >/=4 CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute) classes (P = 0.041, OR: 0.089, 95% CI: 0.009-0.901) and >/=2 first-line treatment agents (P = 0.040, OR: 0.159, 95% CI: 0.028-0.916). On the other hand, we found that seasonal NTS hospitalizations were positively associated with average seasonal temperature (r = 0.961, P = 0.039) and average monthly rainfall (r = 0.921, P <0.001). CONCLUSION: Non-iNTS accounts for the majority of infections in this study; infants </=6 months and children with underlying medical conditions of leukemia are more likely to have invasive infection. The rates of antibiotic resistance in the iNTS isolates are generally lower than those in the non-iNTS isolates. On the other hand, high temperatures and heavy rainfall are positively associated with NTS hospitalizations among children in Ningbo.","['Ke, Yefang', 'Lu, Wenbo', 'Liu, Wenyuan', 'Zhu, Pan', 'Chen, Qunying', 'Zhu, Zhe']","['Ke Y', 'Lu W', 'Liu W', 'Zhu P', 'Chen Q', 'Zhu Z']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0004-4583', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9681-0507', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3450-7259']","[""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Ningbo Women and Children's Hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Ningbo Women and Children's Hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Ningbo Women and Children's Hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China."", ""Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Ningbo Women and Children's Hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Ningbo Women and Children's Hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China."", 'Department of Blood Transfusion, HwaMei Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China.', 'Ningbo Institute of Life and Health Industry, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201005,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Rain', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salmonella Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Tertiary Care Centers']",PMC7561262,,,2020/10/06 06:00,2020/12/23 06:00,['2020/10/05 17:09'],"['2020/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/05 17:09 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pntd.0008732 [doi]', 'PNTD-D-20-00511 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2020 Oct 5;14(10):e0008732. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008732. eCollection 2020 Oct.,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that homoharringtonine (HHT) was incorporated into regimens for pediatric AML with acceptable efficacy and tolerable toxicity. We treated newly diagnosed AML patients aged 0-18 years on the AML-SCMC-2009 protocol. A total of 102 de novo newly diagnosed AML patients aged 0-18 years were enrolled. All patients were treated with ten courses of chemotherapy including double induction, high dose cytarabine consolidation, and maintenance. The cumulative dose of HHT was 165 mg/m(2) and the daunorubicin dose was 120 mg/m(2). Complete remission (CR), overall survival (OS) rate, event free survival (EFS) rate, adverse effect response and prognosis factors were retrospectively evaluated to investigate the long-term outcome and safety of this protocol. Eighty-two patients (80.4%) achieved complete remission with the first induction. The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 65.0% (SE, 4.9%) and 53.3% (SE, 5.2%), respectively. A first induction failure, age older than 2 years, and BCR-ABL translocation were associated with a significantly worse outcome (p < 0.05). No significant drug-related cardiac toxicity was observed. AML-SCMC-2009 protocol which use HHT as backbone drug is efficacious and tolerated. HHT could partially replace anthracycline to be an effective option for childhood AML.","['Tang, Yanjing', 'Luo, Chengjuan', 'Shen, Shuhong', 'Xue, Huiliang', 'Pan, Ci', 'Hu, Wenting', 'Chen, Xiaoxiao', 'Cai, Jiaoyang', 'Chen, Jing', 'Tang, Jingyan']","['Tang Y', 'Luo C', 'Shen S', 'Xue H', 'Pan C', 'Hu W', 'Chen X', 'Cai J', 'Chen J', 'Tang J']",,"[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Key Lab of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology of China Ministry of Health, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Key Lab of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology of China Ministry of Health, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Key Lab of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology of China Ministry of Health, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Key Lab of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology of China Ministry of Health, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Key Lab of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology of China Ministry of Health, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Key Lab of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology of China Ministry of Health, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Key Lab of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology of China Ministry of Health, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Key Lab of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology of China Ministry of Health, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Key Lab of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology of China Ministry of Health, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Key Lab of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology of China Ministry of Health, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201005,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', 'Female', 'Homoharringtonine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'childhood', 'homoharringtonine', 'treatment']",2020/10/06 06:00,2021/04/01 06:00,['2020/10/05 12:08'],"['2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/05 12:08 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2020.1820649 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Mar;38(2):97-107. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2020.1820649.

TP53 disruption is the strongest predictor of chemo-refractoriness and its assessment is the first decisional node in the disease treatment algorithm. AREAS COVERED: The review covers the p53 biological pathway, its genetic alterations and clinical implications in CLL, and its druggable targets. The potential therapeutic options for TP53 disrupted patients are described, including: i) agents circumventing TP53 disruption; ii) targeted therapies restoring the physiological function of mutant p53; and iii) medicines potentiating p53 function. EXPERT OPINION: The key approach to improve CLL outcome is treatment tailoring in individual patients. BCR and BCL2 inhibitors have significantly improved CLL survival, however TP53 disrupted patients still have a less favorable outcome than wild type cases, possibly because these novel drugs do not directly target p53 and do not restore the function of the disrupted p53 pathway. Emerging innovative molecules in cancer are able to restore the p53 mutant protein and/or potentiate the activity of the p53 wild type protein. If these compounds were confirmed as efficacious also for CLL, they would represent another step forward in the care of high risk CLL patients with TP53 abnormalities.","['Moia, Riccardo', 'Boggione, Paola', 'Mahmoud, Abdurraouf Mokhtar', 'Kodipad, Ahad Ahmed', 'Adhinaveni, Ramesh', 'Sagiraju, Sruthi', 'Patriarca, Andrea', 'Gaidano, Gianluca']","['Moia R', 'Boggione P', 'Mahmoud AM', 'Kodipad AA', 'Adhinaveni R', 'Sagiraju S', 'Patriarca A', 'Gaidano G']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7393-1138', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4415-2906', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4681-0151']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale , Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale , Novara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201019,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Survival', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['* TP53 targeting', '*BCL2 inhibitors', '*BCR inhibitors', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*precision medicine']",2020/10/06 06:00,2021/04/22 06:00,['2020/10/05 12:08'],"['2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/05 12:08 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14728222.2020.1832465 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2020 Dec;24(12):1239-1250. doi: 10.1080/14728222.2020.1832465.

Cancer treatment-related toxicities have generated a significant need of finding predictive pharmacogenomic markers for the a priori identification of at risk patients. In the era of precision medicine, high throughput genomic screening such as genome wide association studies (GWAS) might provide useful markers to tailor therapy intensity on patients' genetic profile. Furthermore, these findings could be useful in basic research for better understanding the mechanistic and regulatory pathways of the biological functions associated with ALL treatment toxicities.

AREAS COVERED: This manuscript reviews available data for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory Ph-positive ALL, with a focus on the role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), monoclonal antibodies, and immunotherapy. EXPERT OPINION: Although a majority of patients with first relapsed Ph-positive ALL respond to subsequent salvage chemotherapy plus TKI combination, their outcomes remain poor. The main predictor of survival is the achievement of major molecular response anytime during the morphological response. More treatment strategies to improve survival are under investigation. Monoclonal antibodies and bispecific antibody constructs hold considerable promise in improving the outcomes of patients with relapsed ALL including Ph-positive ALL.","['Balsat, Marie', 'Cacheux, Victoria', 'Carre, Martin', 'Tavernier-Tardy, Emmanuelle', 'Thomas, Xavier']","['Balsat M', 'Cacheux V', 'Carre M', 'Tavernier-Tardy E', 'Thomas X']",,"[""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud , Pierre-Benite, France."", 'Service de Therapie Cellulaire et Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire , Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes , Grenoble, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Institut de Cancerologie de la Loire Lucien Neuwirth , Saint-Etienne, France."", ""Hospices Civils de Lyon, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud , Pierre-Benite, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201015,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Mutation', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*CAR-Ts', '*Philadelphia chromosome', '*blinatumomab', '*inotuzumab ozogamicin']",2020/10/06 06:00,2021/04/15 06:00,['2020/10/05 08:40'],"['2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/05 08:40 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737140.2020.1832890 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2020 Oct;20(10):879-891. doi: 10.1080/14737140.2020.1832890.

We aim to investigate the functional role and underlying mechanism of miR-144 in CRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expressional level of miR-144 and pre-leukemia transcription factor 3 (PBX3) in CRC tissues and cells was confirmed by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. The migration and invasion of CRC cells were detected by transwell assay. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine the specific target of miR-144 in CRC cells. RESULTS: The results displayed that miR-144 expression was significantly decreased in CRC tissues and cells compared to that in normal controls. Additionally, miR-144 mimic suppressed, while miR-144 inhibitor promoted the ability of CRC cell migration and invasion. More importantly, PBX3 was the direct target of miR-144 in regulating CRC development and PBX3 could reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-144 mimic on CRC cells. PBX3 expression was significantly increased in CRC and negatively correlated with miR-144 expression. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, miR-144 suppressed CRC cell migration and invasion by targeting PBX3, suggesting its potential value in the diagnosis and treatment of CRC.","['Cheng, B', 'Zhang, Y', 'Wu, Z-W', 'Cui, Z-C', 'Li, W-L']","['Cheng B', 'Zhang Y', 'Wu ZW', 'Cui ZC', 'Li WL']",,"['Department of Emergency Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China. lwldoctor@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MIRN144 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)']",IM,"['Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,2020/10/06 06:00,2021/05/08 06:00,['2020/10/05 06:25'],"['2020/10/05 06:25 [entrez]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_202009_23019 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2020 Sep;24(18):9361-9369. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_202009_23019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously we demonstrated that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) can be readily derived from non-permissive mouse strains by addition of serum-based media supplemented with GSK3B and MEK inhibitors, termed 2iS media, 3 days into reprogramming. Here, we describe the derivation of second type of iPSC colony from non-permissive mouse strains that can be stably maintained independently of 2iS media. The resulting cells display transcriptional heterogeneity similar to that observed in ESC from permissive genetic backgrounds derived in conventional serum containing media supplemented with leukemia inhibitor factor. However, unlike previous studies that report exclusive subpopulations, we observe both exclusive and simultaneous expression of naive and primed cell surface markers. Herein, we explore shifts in pluripotency in the presence of 2iS and characterize heterogenous subpopulations to determine their pluripotent state and role in heterogenous iPSCs derived from the non-permissive NOD/ShiLtJ strain. We conclude that heterogeneity is a naturally occurring, necessary quality of stem cells that allows for the maintenance of pluripotency. This study further demonstrates the efficacy of the 2iS reprogramming technique. It is also the first study to derive stable ESC-like stem cells from the non-permissive NOD/ShiLtJ and WSB/EiJ strains, enabling easier and broader research possibilities into pluripotency for these and similar non-permissive mouse strains and species.","['Garbutt, Tiffany A', 'Konganti, Kranti', 'Konneker, Thomas', 'Hillhouse, Andrew', 'Phelps, Drake', 'Jones, Alexis', 'Aylor, David', 'Threadgill, David W']","['Garbutt TA', 'Konganti K', 'Konneker T', 'Hillhouse A', 'Phelps D', 'Jones A', 'Aylor D', 'Threadgill DW']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3538-1635'],"['Program in Genetics, Department of Biological Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA.', 'Texas A&M Institute for Genome Sciences and Society, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Medicine, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.', 'Program in Genetics, Department of Biological Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA.', 'Texas A&M Institute for Genome Sciences and Society, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Medicine, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA.', 'Program in Genetics, Department of Biological Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA.', 'Program in Genetics, Department of Biological Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA.', 'Program in Genetics, Department of Biological Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, 27695, USA.', 'Texas A&M Institute for Genome Sciences and Society, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA. dwt@tamu.edu.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Medicine, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA. dwt@tamu.edu.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Biophysics, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, 77843, USA. dwt@tamu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20201004,United States,Mamm Genome,Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society,9100916,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Pecam1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Reprogramming/genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Species Specificity', '*Transcriptome']",,,,2020/10/06 06:00,2021/08/21 06:00,['2020/10/05 06:24'],"['2019/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/05 06:24 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00335-020-09849-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00335-020-09849-x [pii]']",ppublish,Mamm Genome. 2020 Dec;31(9-12):263-286. doi: 10.1007/s00335-020-09849-x.

However, clinical criteria specifically to define COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory syndrome (cHIS) have not been established. We aimed to develop and validate diagnostic criteria for cHIS in a cohort of inpatients with COVID-19. Methods: We searched for clinical research articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and Aug 20, 2020, on features and diagnostic criteria for secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, macrophage activation-like syndrome of sepsis, cytokine release syndrome, and COVID-19. We compared published clinical data for COVID-19 with clinical features of other hyperinflammatory or cytokine storm syndromes. Based on a framework of conserved clinical characteristics, we developed a six-criterion additive scale for cHIS: fever, macrophage activation (hyperferritinaemia), haematological dysfunction (neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio), hepatic injury (lactate dehydrogenase or asparate aminotransferase), coagulopathy (D-dimer), and cytokinaemia (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, or triglycerides). We then validated the association of the cHIS scale with in-hospital mortality and need for mechanical ventilation in consecutive patients in the Intermountain Prospective Observational COVID-19 (IPOC) registry who were admitted to hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. We used a multistate model to estimate the temporal implications of cHIS. Findings: We included 299 patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between March 13 and May 5, 2020, in analyses. Unadjusted discrimination of the maximum daily cHIS score was 0.81 (95% CI 0.74-0.88) for in-hospital mortality and 0.92 (0.88-0.96) for mechanical ventilation; these results remained significant in multivariable analysis (odds ratio 1.6 [95% CI 1.2-2.1], p=0.0020, for mortality and 4.3 [3.0-6.0], p<0.0001, for mechanical ventilation). 161 (54%) of 299 patients met two or more cHIS criteria during their hospital admission; these patients had higher risk of mortality than patients with a score of less than 2 (24 [15%] of 138 vs one [1%] of 161) and for mechanical ventilation (73 [45%] vs three [2%]). In the multistate model, using daily cHIS score as a time-dependent variable, the cHIS hazard ratio for worsening from low to moderate oxygen requirement was 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.6), from moderate oxygen to high-flow oxygen 2.2 (1.1-4.4), and to mechanical ventilation 4.0 (1.9-8.2). Interpretation: We proposed and validated criteria for hyperinflammation in COVID-19. This hyperinflammatory state, cHIS, is commonly associated with progression to mechanical ventilation and death. External validation is needed. The cHIS scale might be helpful in defining target populations for trials and immunomodulatory therapies.

HDAC modulates cell proliferation and angiogenesis and plays an essential role in cell growth. Research shows that up-regulated HDACs are present in many cancer types and synthetic or natural HDAC inhibitors have been used to silence overregulated HDACs. Inhibiting HDACs may cause arrest of cell proliferation, angiogenesis reduction and cell apoptosis. Recent studies indicate that HDAC inhibitors can provide a therapeutic effect in various cancers, such as B-cell lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma and some virus-associated cancers. Some evidence has demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors can increase the expression of immune-related molecules leading to accumulation of CD8 + T cells and causing unresponsive tumor cells to be recognized by the immune system, reducing tumor immunity. This may be a solution for the blockade of PD-1.

To investigate HDAC8 contribution to hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and myeloid leukemic transformation, we generated a zebrafish model with Hdac8 overexpression and observed an increase in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, a phenotype that could be reverted using a specific HDAC8 inhibitor, PCI-34051 (PCI). In addition, we demonstrated that AML cell lines respond differently to PCI treatment: HDAC8 inhibition elicits cytotoxic effect with cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis in THP-1 cells, and cytostatic effect in HL60 cells that lack p53. A combination of cytarabine, a standard anti-AML chemotherapeutic, with PCI resulted in a synergistic effect in all the cell lines tested. We, then, searched for a mechanism behind cell cycle arrest caused by HDAC8 inhibition in the absence of functional p53 and demonstrated an involvement of the canonical WNT signaling in zebrafish and in cell lines. Together, we provide the evidence for the role of HDAC8 in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation in zebrafish and AML cell lines, suggesting HDAC8 inhibition as a therapeutic target in hematological malignancies. Accordingly, we demonstrated the utility of a highly specific HDAC8 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in combination with standard chemotherapy.","['Spreafico, Marco', 'Gruszka, Alicja M', 'Valli, Debora', 'Mazzola, Mara', 'Deflorian, Gianluca', 'Quinte, Arianna', 'Totaro, Maria Grazia', 'Battaglia, Cristina', 'Alcalay, Myriam', 'Marozzi, Anna', 'Pistocchi, Anna']","['Spreafico M', 'Gruszka AM', 'Valli D', 'Mazzola M', 'Deflorian G', 'Quinte A', 'Totaro MG', 'Battaglia C', 'Alcalay M', 'Marozzi A', 'Pistocchi A']",,"['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Oncologia Sperimentale, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Oncologia Sperimentale, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'Cogentech, Societa Benefit, Milan, Italy.', 'Cogentech, Societa Benefit, Milan, Italy.', 'Cogentech, Societa Benefit, Milan, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Oncologia Sperimentale, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Oncologia ed Emato-Oncologia, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200904,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC7498549,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'HDAC8', 'PCI-34051', 'WNT', 'p53', 'zebrafish']",2020/10/06 06:00,2020/10/06 06:01,['2020/10/05 06:21'],"['2020/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/05 06:21 [entrez]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2020.00844 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2020 Sep 4;8:844. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2020.00844. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Spreafico, Gruszka, Valli, Mazzola, Deflorian, Quinte, Totaro,', 'Battaglia, Alcalay, Marozzi and Pistocchi.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aims to construct a prognostic nomogram to better inform clinical practitioners and improve risk stratification for clinical trials. Methods: The developed nomogram was based on the therapeutically applicable research to generate effective treatment (TARGET) database. With this database, we obtained 673 cALL patients with complete clinical information. We identified and integrated significant prognostic factors to build the nomogram model by univariate and multivariate Cox analysis. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of the nomogram were determined by the concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of ROC analysis. Internal validations were assessed by the bootstrapping validation. Results: In the multivariate analysis of the primary cohort, the independent factors for survival were ETV6 RUNX1 fusion status, karyotype, minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 29, and DNA index, which were all integrated into the nomogram. The calibration curve for the probability of survival showed good agreement between the prediction by the nomogram and the actual observation. The C-index of the nomogram for predicting survival was 0.754 (95% CI, 0.715-0.793), and the AUCs for 3-, 5-, and 7-year survival were 0.775, 0.776, and 0.772, respectively. Conclusion: We comprehensively evaluated the risk of clinical factors associated with prognosis and carried out risk stratification.

Chloride intracellular channel 4 (CLIC4) is regulated by p53, c-Myc, and TGF-beta. It induces the NF-kappaB-dependent activation of HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) and participates in tumor growth through its microenvironmental function. However, its prognostic value in AML remains unclear, as well as its co-expression biomarkers. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of CLIC4 expression using two independent large cohorts of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients. Multivariable analysis and multi-omics analysis with weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) in the CN-AML group were also presented. Based on CLIC4 and its related genes, microRNA-target gene interaction network analysis and downstream gene ontology analysis were performed to unveil the complex functions behind CLIC4. Results: We demonstrated that the overexpression of CLIC4 was notably associated with unfavorable outcome in the two independent cohorts of CN-AML patients [overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS): P < 0.0001, n = 185; OS: P = 0.016, n = 232], as well as in the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) Intermediate-I group (OS: P = 0.015, EFS: P = 0.012, n = 115), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Intermediate Risk AML group (OS and EFS: P < 0.0001, n = 225), and the non-M3 AML group (OS and EFS: P < 0.0001, n = 435). Multivariable analysis further validated CLIC4 as a high-risk factor in the CN-AML group. Multi-omics analysis presented the overexpression of CLIC4 as associated with the co-expression of the different gene sets in leukemia, up/downregulation of the immune-related pathways, dysregulation of microRNAs, and hypermethylation around the CpG islands, in open sea regions, and in different gene structural fragments including TSS1500, gene body, 5'UTR region, 3'UTR region, and the first exon. By further performing WGCNA on multi-omics data, certain biomarkers that are co-expressed with CLIC4 were also unveiled. Conclusion: We demonstrated that CLIC4 is a novel, potential unfavorable prognosticator and therapeutic target for CN-AML. As having a key role in CN-AML, the interactions between CLIC4 and other genomics and transcriptomics data were confirmed by performing microRNA-target gene interaction network analysis and gene ontology enrichment analysis.

This forms BCR/ABL1, an active tyrosine kinase protein that promotes cell growth and replication. Despite great progress in CML treatment in the form of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, allogeneic-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is currently used as an important treatment alternative for patients resistant to these inhibitors. Studies have shown that unregulated expression of microRNAs, which act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, is associated with human cancers. This contributes to tumor formation and development by stimulating proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion. Research has demonstrated the potential of microRNAs as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targets. In the present study, we compared the circulating microRNA expression profiles of 14 newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase-CML and 14 Philadelphia chromosome-negative patients after allo-HSCT. For each patient, we tested 758 microRNAs by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. The global expression profile of microRNAs revealed 16 upregulated and 30 downregulated microRNAs. Target genes were analyzed, and key pathways were extracted and compared. Bioinformatics tools were used to analyze data. Among the downregulated miRNA target genes, some genes related to cell proliferation pathways were identified. These results reveal the comprehensive microRNA profile of CML patients and the main pathways related to the target genes of these miRNAs in cytogenetic remission after allo-HSCT. These results provide new resources for exploring stem cell transplantation-based CML treatment strategies.","['Martins, Juliana Ravelli Baldassarre', 'de Moraes, Leonardo Nazario', 'Cury, Sarah Santiloni', 'Dadalto, Juliane', 'Capannacci, Juliana', 'Carvalho, Robson Francisco', 'Nogueira, Celia Regina', 'Hokama, Newton Key', 'Hokama, Paula de Oliveira Montandon']","['Martins JRB', 'de Moraes LN', 'Cury SS', 'Dadalto J', 'Capannacci J', 'Carvalho RF', 'Nogueira CR', 'Hokama NK', 'Hokama POM']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP-FMB), Botucatu, Brazil.', 'Department of Bioprocesses and Biotechnology, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP-FCA), Botucatu, Brazil.', 'Department of Structural and Functional Biology, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP-IBB), Botucatu, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP-FMB), Botucatu, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP-FMB), Botucatu, Brazil.', 'Department of Structural and Functional Biology, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP-IBB), Botucatu, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP-FMB), Botucatu, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP-FMB), Botucatu, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP-FMB), Botucatu, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200904,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7500210,['NOTNLM'],"['Philadelphia chromosome', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'biomarkers', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'miRNAs']",2020/10/06 06:00,2020/10/06 06:01,['2020/10/05 06:20'],"['2019/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/05 06:20 [entrez]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.01544 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Sep 4;10:1544. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01544. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Martins, Moraes, Cury, Dadalto, Capannacci, Carvalho,', 'Nogueira, Hokama and Hokama.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among compounds proposed to fight the SARS-CoV-2-related disease (COVID-19), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), already effective in Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), have been proposed on the basis of their antiviral action already demonstrated against SARS-CoV-1. Very few cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Ph+ ALL and in CML Italian cohorts; authors suggested that this low rate of infections might depend on the use of TKIs, but the biological causes of this phenomenon remain unknown. In this study, the CML model was used to test if TKIs would sustain or not the viral replication and if they could damage patient immunity. Firstly, the infection and replication rate of torquetenovirus (TTV), whose load is inversely proportional to the host immunological control, have been measured in CML patients receiving nilotinib. A very low percentage of subjects were infected at baseline, and TTV did not replicate or at least showed a low replication rate during the follow-up, with a mean load comparable to the measured one in healthy subjects. Then, after gene expression profiling experiments, we found that several ""antiviral"" genes, such as CD28 and IFN gamma, were upregulated, while genes with ""proviral"" action, such as ARG-1, CEACAM1, and FUT4, were less expressed during treatment with imatinib, thus demonstrating that TKIs are not detrimental from the immunological point of view. To sum up, our data could offer some biological explanations to the low COVID-19 occurrence in Ph+ ALL and CML patients and sustain the use of TKIs in COVID-19, as already proposed by several international ongoing studies.","['Galimberti, Sara', 'Petrini, Mario', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Ricci, Federica', 'Balducci, Serena', 'Grassi, Susanna', 'Guerrini, Francesca', 'Ciabatti, Elena', 'Mechelli, Sandra', 'Di Paolo, Antonello', 'Baldini, Chiara', 'Baglietto, Laura', 'Macera, Lisa', 'Spezia, Pietro Giorgio', 'Maggi, Fabrizio']","['Galimberti S', 'Petrini M', 'Barate C', 'Ricci F', 'Balducci S', 'Grassi S', 'Guerrini F', 'Ciabatti E', 'Mechelli S', 'Di Paolo A', 'Baldini C', 'Baglietto L', 'Macera L', 'Spezia PG', 'Maggi F']",,"['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology, AOUP, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology, AOUP, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Research and New Technologies in Medicine and Surgery, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Research and New Technologies in Medicine and Surgery, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Translational Research and New Technologies in Medicine and Surgery, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200902,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7493657,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'COVID-19', 'NanoString', 'TKIs', 'TTV', 'imatinib', 'immunity', 'nilotinib']",2020/10/06 06:00,2020/10/06 06:01,['2020/10/05 06:20'],"['2020/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/05 06:20 [entrez]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.01428 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Sep 2;10:1428. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01428. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Galimberti, Petrini, Barate, Ricci, Balducci, Grassi,', 'Guerrini, Ciabatti, Mechelli, Di Paolo, Baldini, Baglietto, Macera, Spezia and', 'Maggi.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient manifested acute coronary syndrome. Even after emergent percutaneous coronary intervention, his performance status remained poor, so no chemotherapy against leukemia was given. The final white blood cell count reached 291,700/muL, and the platelet count was elevated to 510,000/muL. No cytogenetic studies were performed. He died at the 25(th) day of hospitalization. Autopsy revealed marked leukemic infiltration to the endocardium and subendocardial myocardium. Subendocardial myonecrosis was surrounded or replaced by the leukemic blasts, and neither granulation tissue reaction nor fibrosis was observed. In the cardiovascular lumen, lard-like blood clots were formed and microscopically consisted of leukemic blasts and platelets (leukemic thrombi). Infiltration of leukemic blasts was seen in the body cavities and systemic organs including the lung. The MPO-positive blasts lacked azurophilic granules and expressed the stem cell markers, CD34 and CD117 (c-kit). No features of myelofibrosis were seen in the 100% cellular marrow. In the endocardium, liver, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, megakaryocytic cells (CD42b/CD61+, MPO-) were distributed, while the small-sized blastic cells in the blood and tissues predominantly expressed MPO. The blasts lacked expression of CD42b/CD61. Megakaryocytic differentiation might be stimulated by certain tissue factors. AML accompanying megakaryocytic differentiation in certain tissues and organs should be distinguished from acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.

Results: 18 patients (41%) had a symptomatic VTE following peg-asparaginase. The cumulative incidence rate was 25% (95% CI: 13-38%) within 30 days of the initial dose. Personal history of thrombosis was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of VTE with HR of 2.73 (95% CI: 1.40-5.33, p = 0.003) after adjusting for gender. Conclusion: These data indicate a high rate of VTE in the AYA ALL population following treatment with peg-asparaginase.","['Underwood, Brynne', 'Zhao, Qiuhong', 'Walker, Alison R', 'Mims, Alice S', 'Vasu, Sumithira', 'Long, Meixiao', 'Z Haque, Tamanna', 'Blaser, Bradley W', 'Grieselhuber, Nicole R', 'Wall, Sarah A', 'Behbehani, Gregory K', 'Blachly, James S', 'Larkin, Karilyn', 'Byrd, John C', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Wang, Tzu-Fei', 'Bhatnagar, Bhavana']","['Underwood B', 'Zhao Q', 'Walker AR', 'Mims AS', 'Vasu S', 'Long M', 'Z Haque T', 'Blaser BW', 'Grieselhuber NR', 'Wall SA', 'Behbehani GK', 'Blachly JS', 'Larkin K', 'Byrd JC', 'Garzon R', 'Wang TF', 'Bhatnagar B']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2407-9000', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4968-0712']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200904,England,Int J Hematol Oncol,International journal of hematologic oncology,101600758,,,,PMC7521187,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'adolescent young adult', 'peg-asparaginase', 'risk factors', 'venous thromboembolism']",2020/10/06 06:00,2020/10/06 06:01,['2020/10/05 06:18'],"['2020/10/05 06:18 [entrez]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.2217/ijh-2020-0009 [doi]'],epublish,Int J Hematol Oncol. 2020 Sep 4;9(3):IJH28. doi: 10.2217/ijh-2020-0009.,['(c) 2020 Bhavana Bhatnagar.'],,"['Financial & competing interests disclosure The authors have no relevant', 'affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a', 'financial interest in or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials', 'discussed in the manuscript.

The cause of chemotherapy drug resistance is related to MDR gene which is located on chromosome 7 (7q21-31) and it is mainly connected with energy-dependent efflux (P-glycoprotein). This study was conducted to assess the correlation between MDR polymorphism and chemotherapy efficiency with Vincristine in a sample of Iraqi Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients. Methods: The blood sample of 200 AML patients and 200 controls were collected and the frequency of rs2032582 was calculated through sequencing and then the role of different genetic patterns was evaluated on cancer cells by MTT assay. Results: The results indicate that GG and TT genotypes (20 and 20.5% from total patients count) are more frequent in Iraqi AML patients than other genetic patterns in MDR gene and also the genotype TA is more sensitive to Vincristine chemotherapy than other genotypes. Conclusion: It seems that genetic pattern is the main factor in determination of chemotherapy of AML patients, and patients should not undergo chemotherapy with such drugs, especially Vincristine.","['Abdulkareem, Rafid A', 'Rafaa, Tamadher Abbas', 'Jasim, Hamsa Ahmed', 'Suleiman, Ahmed Abdul Jabbar']","['Abdulkareem RA', 'Rafaa TA', 'Jasim HA', 'Suleiman AAJ']",,"['Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology for Post Graduate Studies, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'University of Anbar, Anbar, Iraq.', 'Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology for Post Graduate Studies, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'College of Science, University of Anbar, Anbar, Iraq.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Avicenna J Med Biotechnol,Avicenna journal of medical biotechnology,101511065,,,,PMC7502164,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Genetic', 'MDR gene', 'Polymorphism', 'Vincristine']",2020/10/06 06:00,2020/10/06 06:01,['2020/10/05 06:18'],"['2020/10/05 06:18 [entrez]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:01 [medline]']",['AJMB-12-241 [pii]'],ppublish,Avicenna J Med Biotechnol. 2020 Oct-Dec;12(4):241-245.,['Copyright(c) 2020 Avicenna Research Institute.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

African studies show that chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is the most common leukaemia, and registry data display a lower mean age at diagnosis. Prognosis is generally good with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but the molecular response of Imatinib treatment has never been studied in East Africa, and the outcome remains unknown. This study assessed the early molecular response (MR) as a predictor for long-term outcome and barriers to access treatment. Methods: A case series of patients with CML from Northern Tanzania documented demographics and laboratory and clinical findings at diagnosis and after 3 months. The regression analysis has been performed on early MR and clinical and demographic variables using the chi2-test. The barriers of potential treatments have been assessed. Results: A total of 30 patients have been analysed. The mean age was 41 years. All patients had splenomegaly, whereas 16 had hepatomegaly. Complete haematologic response was achieved in 16 and early MR in 9 patients. Hepatomegaly was positively correlated with unfavourable early MR. The average kilometre from home to hospital was 282 km (5-1,158 km). Travel expenses and time investments pose an impediment to treatment. Conclusion: Patients are younger, and early MR rates are lower compared to other studies. The finding of hepatomegaly as a risk factor for unfavourable early MR was described previously in West Africa. Adherence to therapy is high in the first months of treatment. Furthermore, research is needed to understand the poor MR and the common presentation of hepatomegaly. Outreach clinics might be a solution to reduce impediments to treatment.","['Henke, Oliver', 'Mapendo, Priscus John', 'Mkwizu, Elifuraha Wilson', 'le Coutre, Philipp']","['Henke O', 'Mapendo PJ', 'Mkwizu EW', 'le Coutre P']",,"['Institute for Tropical Medicine and International Health, Charite Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Cancer Care Centre, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, Moshi, Tanzania.', 'https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9838-9805.', 'Cancer Care Centre, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, Moshi, Tanzania.', 'Cancer Care Centre, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre, Moshi, Tanzania.', 'Medical Department, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Tumor Immunology (CCM), Charite Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200818,England,Ecancermedicalscience,Ecancermedicalscience,101392236,,,,PMC7498273,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'East Africa', 'Tanzania', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'molecular response']",2020/10/06 06:00,2020/10/06 06:01,['2020/10/05 06:17'],"['2020/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/10/05 06:17 [entrez]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3332/ecancer.2020.1089 [doi]', 'can-14-1089 [pii]']",epublish,Ecancermedicalscience. 2020 Aug 18;14:1089. doi: 10.3332/ecancer.2020.1089. eCollection 2020.,['(c) the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.'],,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of the intracellular Na(+) concentration ([Na(+)]i) which is closely linked to the intracellular Ca(2+) regulation has been largely overlooked. The [Na(+)]i is regulated by Na(+) transport proteins such as the Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger (NCX1), Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, and Na(+)-permeable, transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel. Stimulating with either N-formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF) or complement protein C5a causes distinct changes of the [Na(+)]i. fMLF induces a sustained increase of [Na(+)]i, surprisingly, reaching higher values in TRPM2(-/-) neutrophils. This outcome is unexpected and remains unexplained. In both genotypes, C5a elicits only a transient rise of the [Na(+)]i. The difference in [Na(+)]i measured at t = 10 min after stimulation is inversely related to neutrophil chemotaxis. Neutrophil chemotaxis is more efficient in C5a than in an fMLF gradient. Moreover, lowering the extracellular Na(+) concentration from 140 to 72 mM improves chemotaxis of WT but not of TRPM2(-/-) neutrophils. Increasing the [Na(+)]i by inhibiting the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase results in disrupted chemotaxis. This is most likely due to the impact of the altered Na(+) homeostasis and presumably NCX1 function whose expression was shown by means of qPCR and which critically relies on proper extra- to intracellular Na(+) concentration gradients. Increasing the [Na(+)]i by a few mmol/l may suffice to switch its transport mode from forward (Ca(2+)-efflux) to reverse (Ca(2+)-influx) mode. The role of NCX1 in neutrophil chemotaxis is corroborated by its blocker, which also causes a complete inhibition of chemotaxis.","['Najder, Karolina', 'Rugi, Micol', 'Lebel, Megane', 'Schroder, Julia', 'Oster, Leonie', 'Schimmelpfennig, Sandra', 'Sargin, Sarah', 'Petho, Zoltan', 'Bulk, Etmar', 'Schwab, Albrecht']","['Najder K', 'Rugi M', 'Lebel M', 'Schroder J', 'Oster L', 'Schimmelpfennig S', 'Sargin S', 'Petho Z', 'Bulk E', 'Schwab A']",,"['Institute of Physiology II, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Physiology II, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'University of Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.', 'Institute of Physiology II, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Physiology II, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Physiology II, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Physiology II, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Physiology II, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Physiology II, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Physiology II, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200908,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (NCX1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sodium-Calcium Exchanger)', '0 (TRPM Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPM2 protein, mouse)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects/*immunology', 'Complement C5a/immunology/pharmacology', 'Homeostasis/*immunology', 'Intracellular Fluid/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophil Activation/drug effects', 'Sodium/*physiology', 'Sodium-Calcium Exchanger/physiology', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/physiology', 'TRPM Cation Channels/deficiency/*physiology']",PMC7506047,['NOTNLM'],"['*NCX1', '*TRP channels', '*chemotaxis', '*intracellular sodium', '*neutrophil']",2020/10/06 06:00,2021/05/07 06:00,['2020/10/05 06:16'],"['2020/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/05 06:16 [entrez]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.02124 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Sep 8;11:2124. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.02124. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Najder, Rugi, Lebel, Schroder, Oster, Schimmelpfennig, Sargin,', 'Petho, Bulk and Schwab.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB is making control of TB more difficult. Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine fails to prevent pulmonary TB in adults, and there is an urgent need for a vaccine that is also effective in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection. Therefore, TB control may benefit on novel therapeutic options beyond antimicrobial treatment. Host-directed immunotherapies could offer therapeutic strategies for patients with drug-resistant TB or with HIV and TB coinfection. In the last years, the use of donor lymphocytes after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has emerged as a new strategy in the cure of hematologic malignancies in order to induce graft-versus leukemia and graft-versus-infection effects. Moreover, adoptive therapy has proven to be effective in controlling cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus reactivation in immunocompromised patients with ex vivo expanded viral antigen-specific T cells. Unconventional T cells are a heterogeneous group of T lymphocytes with limited diversity. One of their characteristics is that antigen recognition is not restricted by the classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC). They include CD1 (cluster of differentiation 1)-restricted T cells, MHC-related protein-1-restricted mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, MHC class Ib-reactive T cells, and gammadelta T cells. Because these T cells are genotype-independent, they are also termed ""donor unrestricted"" T cells. The combined features of low donor diversity and the lack of genetic restriction make these cells suitable candidates for T cell-based immunotherapy of TB.","['La Manna, Marco P', 'Orlando, Valentina', 'Tamburini, Bartolo', 'Badami, Giusto D', 'Dieli, Francesco', 'Caccamo, Nadia']","['La Manna MP', 'Orlando V', 'Tamburini B', 'Badami GD', 'Dieli F', 'Caccamo N']",,"['Central Laboratory of Advanced Diagnosis and Biomedical Research, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Neurosciences and Advanced Diagnostics, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Central Laboratory of Advanced Diagnosis and Biomedical Research, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Neurosciences and Advanced Diagnostics, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Central Laboratory of Advanced Diagnosis and Biomedical Research, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Neurosciences and Advanced Diagnostics, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Central Laboratory of Advanced Diagnosis and Biomedical Research, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Neurosciences and Advanced Diagnostics, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Central Laboratory of Advanced Diagnosis and Biomedical Research, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Neurosciences and Advanced Diagnostics, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Central Laboratory of Advanced Diagnosis and Biomedical Research, Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Neurosciences and Advanced Diagnostics, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200903,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,['0 (BCG Vaccine)'],IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'BCG Vaccine/immunology/therapeutic use', 'HIV Infections/immunology/therapy', 'HIV-1/immunology', 'Humans', '*Mucosal-Associated Invariant T Cells/immunology/transplantation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*immunology', '*Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/immunology/therapy']",PMC7497315,['NOTNLM'],"['*T cell receptor', '*cytotoxicity', '*host-directed therapy', '*tuberculosis', '*unconventional T cells']",2020/10/06 06:00,2021/04/29 06:00,['2020/10/05 06:16'],"['2020/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/05 06:16 [entrez]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.02107 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Sep 3;11:2107. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.02107. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 La Manna, Orlando, Tamburini, Badami, Dieli and Caccamo.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immuno-gene therapy approaches have led to the approval of four advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) for the treatment of p53-deficient tumors (Gendicine and Imlygic), refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Kymriah) and large B-cell lymphomas (Yescarta). In spite of these remarkable successes, immunotherapy is still associated with severe side effects for CD19+ malignancies and is inefficient for solid tumors. Controlling transgene expression through an externally administered inductor is envisioned as a potent strategy to improve safety and efficacy of immunotherapy. The aim is to develop smart immunogene therapy-based-ATMPs, which can be controlled by the addition of innocuous drugs or agents, allowing the clinicians to manage the intensity and durability of the therapy.

Recently, lncRNAs have been reported to participate in the development of AML. Our data demonstrated that MMP15 and LINC00963 were upregulated and miR-608 was decreased in AML cells (THP-1, HL-60, HEL and MOLM-13) compared to HS-5 cells. RT-qPCR results showed that LINC00963 levels were higher in the serum and bone marrow of AML cases than in controls. Moreover, overexpression of LINC00963 promoted AML cell growth and EMT progression in both THP-1 and HL-60 cells. Furthermore, miR-608 levels were downregulated in the serum and bone marrow of AML cases compared with controls, and Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that LINC00963 was negatively correlated with miR-608 in the serum and bone marrow of AML samples. In addition, we demonstrated that LINC00963 sponged miR-608 expression and that MMP-15 was a target of miR-608 in AML cells. Finally, rescue experiments indicated that ectopic expression of LINC00963 accelerated cell growth and EMT development by modulating MMP-15. These data demonstrated that LINC00963 acted as an oncogene and may be a potential target for AML treatment.","['Zuo, Wenli', 'Zhou, Keshu', 'Deng, Mei', 'Lin, Quande', 'Yin, Qingsong', 'Zhang, Chunlei', 'Zhou, Jian', 'Song, Yongping']","['Zuo W', 'Zhou K', 'Deng M', 'Lin Q', 'Yin Q', 'Zhang C', 'Zhou J', 'Song Y']",,"['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, Henan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201004,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,,IM,,PMC7732318,['NOTNLM'],"['LINC00963', 'MMP-15', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'miR-608']",2020/10/06 06:00,2020/10/06 06:00,['2020/10/05 06:11'],"['2020/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/05 06:11 [entrez]']","['103252 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.103252 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Aging (Albany NY). 2020 Oct 4;12(19):18970-18981. doi: 10.18632/aging.103252.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient was 52-year-old woman who had relapsed leukemia with a remission duration of 7 months, and she received re-induction with consolidation, allogeneic HSCT. After 4 days of engraftment, she had headache with fever and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis presented increased intracerebral pressure, white blood cell counts with dominant neutrophils, elevated glucose and protein level. Brain imaging showed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement with scattered miliary TB lesions suggesting disseminated TB disease. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected in CSF and sputum anti-TB medication was started. She was IGRA positive before transplantation but did not receive treatment for LTBI prior or during the transplant. Unfortunately, she expired because of intracerebral hemorrhage. TB meningitis is a rare but important complication of HSCT as it can cause serious neurologic sequelae, even death. So in transplant recipients having high risk of TB reactivation, LTBI treatment is recommended before or along with transplantation. If latent TB is not treated, vigilant suspicion and early diagnosis of TB meningitis could improve the transplant outcome.","['Yang, Jinyoung', 'Moon, Sunghyun', 'Kwon, Minsuk', 'Huh, Kyungmin', 'Jung, Chul Won']","['Yang J', 'Moon S', 'Kwon M', 'Huh K', 'Jung CW']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8378-8937', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0513-3115', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1833-6576', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5140-3964', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5474-6807']","['Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201022,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,,IM,"['Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', '*Tuberculosis, Meningeal']",PMC8244057,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'meningitis', 'miliary TB', 'stem cell transplantation', 'tuberculosis']",2020/10/05 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2020/10/04 20:36'],"['2020/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/04 20:36 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tid.13482 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2021 Apr;23(2):e13482. doi: 10.1111/tid.13482.

This is a useful model for genetic analyses of leukemia progression. To identify other mutations that deteriorate the hyperplasia, we aimed to investigate whether hyper-activation of common signaling cascade enabled to enhance the phenotypes. Ectopic expression of the constitutively active forms of MAPK signaling factors in the mutant increased the hyperplasia and the number of circulating hemocytes, resulting in the production of LG fragments. The LG phenotype was related to the reduced DE-cadherin level in the mutants. Depletion of Drosophila MCRIP, involved in MAPK-induced silencing of cadherin gene expression, exhibited a similar enhancement of the mxc(mbn1) phenotypes. Furthermore, expression of MMP1 proteinase that cleaves the extracellular matrix proteins increased in the mutant larvae harboring MAPK cascade activation. Depletion of Mmp1 and that of pnt (required for Mmp1 expression) suppressed the LG hyperplasia. Hence, we speculated that reduction in DE-cadherin level by either down-regulation of MCRIP or up-regulation of MMP1 was involved in the progression of the tumor phenotype. Our findings can contribute to understanding the mechanism underlying human leukemia progression.","['Kurihara, Masanori', 'Takarada, Kazuki', 'Inoue, Yoshihiro H']","['Kurihara M', 'Takarada K', 'Inoue YH']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0233-6726'],"['Department of Insect Biomedical Research, Center for Advanced Insect Research Promotion, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Matsugasaki, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Insect Biomedical Research, Center for Advanced Insect Research Promotion, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Matsugasaki, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Insect Biomedical Research, Center for Advanced Insect Research Promotion, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Matsugasaki, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201118,England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Mxc protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (pnt protein, Drosophila)', 'EC 3.4.24.7 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 1)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cadherins/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Hemocytes/pathology', 'Larva/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Drosophila', 'MAP kinase', 'MCRIP', 'MMP1', 'Ras', 'hemocytes', 'lymph gland', 'mxc']",2020/10/05 06:00,2021/07/07 06:00,['2020/10/04 20:35'],"['2020/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/04 20:35 [entrez]']",['10.1111/gtc.12811 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Cells. 2020 Dec;25(12):757-769. doi: 10.1111/gtc.12811.

It remains a matter of debate whether RALD is a chronic and benign lymphoproliferative disorder or a pre-malignant condition. We report the case of a 7-year-old girl diagnosed with RALD due to somatic KRAS mutation who progressed to a juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia phenotype and finally evolved into acute myeloid leukemia. The case report prompted a literature review by a search for all RALD cases published in PubMed and Embase. We identified 27 patients with RALD. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1 and median age at disease onset was 2 years (range 3 months-36 years). Sixteen patients (59%) harbored somatic mutations in KRAS and 11 patients (41%) somatic mutations in NRAS. The most common features were splenomegaly (26/27 patients), autoimmune cytopenia (15/16 patients), monocytosis (18/24 patients), pericarditis (6 patients), and skin involvement (4 patients). Two patients went on to develop a hematopoietic malignancy. In summary, the current case documents an additional warning about the long-term risk of malignancy in RALD.","['Neven, Quentin', 'Boulanger, Cecile', 'Bruwier, Annelyse', 'de Ville de Goyet, Maelle', 'Meyts, Isabelle', 'Moens, Leen', 'Van Damme, An', 'Brichard, Benedicte']","['Neven Q', 'Boulanger C', 'Bruwier A', 'de Ville de Goyet M', 'Meyts I', 'Moens L', 'Van Damme A', 'Brichard B']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1146-5933'],"['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite catholique de Louvain, Avenue Hippocrate 10, 1200, Brussels, Belgium. neven.quentin@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite catholique de Louvain, Avenue Hippocrate 10, 1200, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Grand Hopital de Charleroi, Charleroi, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite catholique de Louvain, Avenue Hippocrate 10, 1200, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Inborn Errors of Immunity, Department of Immunology, Microbiology and Transplantation, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatrics, ERN-RITA Core Center, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory for Inborn Errors of Immunity, Department of Immunology, Microbiology and Transplantation, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite catholique de Louvain, Avenue Hippocrate 10, 1200, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite catholique de Louvain, Avenue Hippocrate 10, 1200, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201004,Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,['EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome/diagnosis/etiology', 'Autoimmunity/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Management', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotype', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Skin/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Autoimmunity', '*KRAS', '*NRAS', '*Ras-associated autoimmune leukoproliferative disorder', '*malignancy']",2020/10/05 06:00,2022/01/15 06:00,['2020/10/04 20:34'],"['2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/04 20:34 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10875-020-00883-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s10875-020-00883-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 2021 Jan;41(1):51-58. doi: 10.1007/s10875-020-00883-7.

The bone marrow niche plays a major role in maintaining the homeostasis and is often injured by the chemotherapeutic drugs leading to catastrophic consequences like myelodysplastic syndrome. In the present study, we made an attempt to find out the osteoblastic niche related alterations in the myelodysplastic bone marrow through mainly flowcytometric and fluorescent microscopic studies. We have also checked the condition of the myelodysplastic bone through micro computed tomography. The results revealed that the affected osteoblasts of the myelodysplastic bone marrow compelled the hematopoietic stem cell to come out of quiescence and become actively proliferating, and in this scenario the decline in expression of cell adhesion molecules like N-Cadherin, Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM) and upregulated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) played a major role. The hike in number of osteoclasts in myelodysplastic cases than control also shattered the balance between bone formation and resorption ratio. We have recorded a dysregulated expression of transcription factors GATA2 and CEBPalpha (CCAAT-enhancer-binding-protein) in the hematopoietic stem progenitor compartment of the myelodysplastic bone marrow, the main reason behind the presence of abnormal myeloblasts in myelodysplastic cases. Collectively, we can say the coordinated perturbations in the osteoblastic niche, cell adhesion molecules together with the transcription factors has resulted in the uncontrolled proliferation of hematopoietic stem cell, dysregulated myelopoiesis, early trafficking of hematopoietic progenitors to blood compartment and at the same time pancytopenic peripheral blood conditions during the progression of N-Ethyl N Nitroso Urea (ENU) induced myelodysplasia.","['Daw, Suchismita', 'Law, Sujata']","['Daw S', 'Law S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2115-7440'],"['Stem Cell Research and Application Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Medical, Biotechnology, Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, 108, C.R Avenue, Kolkata, 700073, West Bengal, India.', 'Stem Cell Research and Application Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Medical, Biotechnology, Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, 108, C.R Avenue, Kolkata, 700073, West Bengal, India. msuj2002@yahoo.co.in.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201004,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'X-Ray Microtomography']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CEBPalpha', 'Cell adhesion molecules', 'GATA2', 'MDS', 'N-cadherin', 'Osteoblastic niche']",2020/10/05 06:00,2021/07/20 06:00,['2020/10/04 20:34'],"['2020/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/04 20:34 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11010-020-03920-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s11010-020-03920-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2021 Feb;476(2):535-551. doi: 10.1007/s11010-020-03920-6.

Our CLL patient relapsed 6 months after the end of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab frontline therapy and complained of lower limb pains. A bone marrow biopsy was performed and showed concomitant CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma and ALK-positive histiocytosis with an identical immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement in both neoplasms, suggesting clonal relationship.

This study evaluated latent longitudinal trajectories and risk factors of neurocognitive outcomes in childhood ALL. METHODS: There were 233 participants with ALL who were enrolled on a phase 3, risk-stratified chemotherapy-only clinical trial (NCT00137111) and who completed protocol-directed neurocognitive assessments [47.6% female, mean (SD) = 6.6 (3.7) years]. Measures of sustained attention, learning/memory, and parent ratings of attention were completed during and after treatment. Longitudinal latent class analyses were used to classify participants into distinct trajectories. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of class membership. RESULTS: Within the overall group, attention performance was below age expectations across time (Conners Continuous Performance Test detectability/variability, p < 0.01); memory performance and parent ratings were below expectations at later phases (California Verbal Learning Test learning slope, p < 0.05; Conners Parent Rating Scale, Revised attention/learning, p < 0.05). Most participants (80-89%) had stable neurocognitive profiles; smaller groups showed declining (3-6%) or improving (3-11%) trajectories. Older age (p = 0.020), female sex (p = 0.018), and experiencing sepsis (p = 0.047) were associated with greater attention problems over time. Lower baseline IQ was associated with improved memory (p = 0.035) and fewer ratings of attention problems (p = 0.013) over time. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with ALL have stable neurocognitive profiles. Smaller groups have significant impairments shortly after diagnosis or have worsening performance over time. A tiered assessment approach, which includes consideration of individual and clinical risk factors, may be useful for monitoring neurocognitive functioning during treatment and survivorship.","['Partanen, Marita', 'Phipps, Sean', 'Russell, Kathryn', 'Anghelescu, Doralina L', 'Wolf, Joshua', 'Conklin, Heather M', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Jacola, Lisa M']","['Partanen M', 'Phipps S', 'Russell K', 'Anghelescu DL', 'Wolf J', 'Conklin HM', 'Krull KR', 'Inaba H', 'Pui CH', 'Jacola LM']",,"['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology.', ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Psychol,Journal of pediatric psychology,7801773,,IM,"['Aged', 'Child', 'Cognition', '*Cognition Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Learning', 'Male', 'Memory', 'Neuropsychological Tests', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",PMC7896273,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer and oncology', '*longitudinal research', '*neuropsychology']",2020/10/05 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2020/10/04 20:34'],"['2020/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/04 20:34 [entrez]']","['5917812 [pii]', '10.1093/jpepsy/jsaa086 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Psychol. 2021 Feb 19;46(2):168-178. doi: 10.1093/jpepsy/jsaa086.,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

This study was designed to determine the clinical, biological features and outcomes among children with ALL treated at the only pediatric hematology-oncology center in North Macedonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy four consecutive children age 1 to 14 years, diagnosed with ALL between January 1, 2010 and October 31, 2017 and treated according to ALL IC BFM 2002 protocol were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 5 years and males were predominant (60.8%). Precursor B-cell ALL was diagnosed in 81.1% of patients, while 18.9% had T cell ALL. CNS involvement at the time of diagnoses was present in 6.8% of patients. Complete remission was achieved in 93.2% of patients. The induction death rate was 5.4%. The rate of death during first complete remission was 4.1%. Relapse occurred in 13.5% of patients. After a median observation time of 44 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates (+/- standard error) were 79.4% +/- 5.2% and 74% +/- 5.7%, respectively. The 5-year EFS rate for patients categorized as standard risk by NCI criteria was significantly higher than for high risk patients (83.3% versus 46.7%; P<0.001). Patients with precursor B-cell ALL and negative minimal residual disease (MRD) status at the end of induction had the best prognoses. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the treatment results of childhood ALL in North Macedonia are comparable to those obtained in the ALL IC BFM 2002 trial.","['Jovanovska, Aleksandra', 'Trakova-Antevska, Zorica', 'Kocheva, Svetlana', 'Stankovikj, Svetlana', 'Panovska-Stavridis, Irina', 'Dimovski, Aleksandar', 'Martinova, Kata']","['Jovanovska A', 'Trakova-Antevska Z', 'Kocheva S', 'Stankovikj S', 'Panovska-Stavridis I', 'Dimovski A', 'Martinova K']",,"[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Clinic for Children's Diseases, Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Clinic for Children's Diseases, Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Clinic for Children's Diseases, Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia."", 'University Clinic for Hematology, Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia.', 'University Clinic for Hematology, Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Ss.

Regarding the latter, it is still not clear which pathways are active, and if they are modified in case of illness of the immune system. Our goal in this study was to determine mRNA expression of different steroidogenic enzymes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals of both sexes and of different ages, and then to compare their expression between healthy individuals and patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Furthermore, to elucidate possible mechanisms that regulate enzyme expression, we analyzed epigenetic events like promoter methylation. We determined that normal cells of the immune system, regardless of sex and age, expressed P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc), cytochrome P450 17alpha-hydroxylase/c17,20-lyase (P45017alpha), 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta5-Delta4-isomerase (3beta-HSD), steroid 5 alpha reductase (5alpha-R) types 1, 2 and 3, 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3alpha-HSD) type 3, and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD) types 1, 3 and 5. We also established that 5alpha-R 1, 5alpha-R 3, 3alpha-HSD 3, 17beta-HSD 1 and 17beta-HSD 5 expression was altered in CLL patients, and that promoter regions of 5alpha-R 1, 17beta-HSD 1 and 17beta-HSD 5 were diferentially methylated. These results suggest that steroidogenic pathways may be affected in CLL cells, and this could be related to disease pathogenesis.","['Gaydou, Luisa', 'Rossetti, Ma Florencia', 'Tschopp, Ma Virginia', 'Stoker, Cora', 'Bosquiazzo, Veronica L', 'Ramos, Jorge G']","['Gaydou L', 'Rossetti MF', 'Tschopp MV', 'Stoker C', 'Bosquiazzo VL', 'Ramos JG']",,"['Departamento de Bioquimica Clinica y Cuantitativa, Facultad de Bioquimica y Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional del Litoral, Santa Fe, Argentina; Instituto de Salud y Ambiente del Litoral(ISAL), Facultad de Bioquimica y Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional del Litoral-CONICET, Santa Fe, Argentina.

Within a large international prospective cohort, we evaluated clinical outcomes in these 3 populations. We conducted a secondary analysis of the EFRAIM study, a multicenter observational study of immunocompromised adults with ARF admitted to 62 intensive care units (ICUs) in 16 countries. We described characteristics and compared outcomes of patients with HM who did not undergo transplantation and patients who underwent autologous or allogeneic HCT using multivariable logistic regression and propensity score-matched analyses. A total of 801 patients were included: 570 who did not undergo transplantation, 86 autologous HCT recipients and 145 allogeneic HCT recipients. Acute myelogenous leukemia (171 of 570; 30%) was the most common HM and most common indication for allogeneic HCT (76 of 145; 52%). Compared with the patients who did not undergo HCT and autologous HCT recipients, allogeneic HCT recipients were younger, had fewer comorbid conditions, and were more likely to undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy in the ICU. Unadjusted ICU and hospital mortality were 35% and 45%, respectively, across the entire cohort. In multivariable regression analysis, autologous HCT (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], .57 to 2.03; P = .82) and allogeneic HCT (OR, .99; 95% CI, .60 to 1.66; P = .98) were not associated with higher hospital mortality compared with the no-HCT cohort, adjusting for demographic, functional, clinical, malignancy, and ARF characteristics. The results were similar when analyzed using propensity score-matching techniques.

This heterogeneity supports poor prognosis partially through the variability in response to the standard chemotherapy. Further understanding of molecular heterogeneity has promoted the development of novel treatments, some of which target mitochondrial metabolism and function. This review discusses the relative dependency that AML cells have on mitochondrial function, and the ability to pivot this reliance to target important subsets of AML cells, including leukemia stem cells (LSCs). LSCs are tumor-initiating cells that are resistant to standard chemotherapy and promote the persistence and relapse of AML. Historically, LSCs have been targeted based on immunophenotype, but recent developments in the understanding of LSC metabolism has demonstrated unique abilities to target LSCs while sparing normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through inhibition of mitochondrial function. Here we highlight the use of small molecules that have been demonstrated to effectively target mitochondrial function. IACS-010759 and ME-344 target the electron transport chain (ETC) to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The imipridone family (ONC201, ONC206, ONC212) of inhibitors target mitochondria through activation of ClpP mitochondrial protease and reduce function of essential pathways. These molecules offer a new mechanism for developing clinical therapies in AML and support novel strategies to target LSCs in parallel with conventional therapies.","['Carter, Jenna L', 'Hege, Katie', 'Kalpage, Hasini A', 'Edwards, Holly', 'Huttemann, Maik', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Ge, Yubin']","['Carter JL', 'Hege K', 'Kalpage HA', 'Edwards H', 'Huttemann M', 'Taub JW', 'Ge Y']",,"['Cancer Biology Graduate Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA; MD/PhD Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Cancer Biology Graduate Program, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA; Molecular Therapeutics Program, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.', ""Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA; Molecular Therapeutics Program, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA; Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI, USA.

Nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) is involved in the process of T-ALL, but the regulatory mechanism is still not known clearly. METHODS: The expression levels of NEAT1 and miR-146b-5p in T-ALL cells were performed by qRT-PCR and NOTCH1 protein level- wwWwas determined by western blot assay. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to detect the interaction between NEAT1 and miR-146b-5p, as well as miR-146b-5p and NOTCH1. The cell proliferation was measured by using MTT assay and colony formation assay. RESULTS: The expression levels of NEAT1 were markedly increased, but miR-146b-5p levels were reduced in T-ALL cells. Knockdown of NEAT1 or overexpression of miR-146b-5p decreased NOTCH1 expression, inhibited the proliferation of T-ALL cells. MiR-146b-5p bound both NEAT1 and NOTCH1 3'-UTR directly. Finally, inhibition of miR-146b-5p could abrogate the effects of NEAT1 knockdown on the proliferation of T-ALL cells. CONCLUSION: NEAT1 promotes the proliferation of T-ALL cells by sponging miR-146b-5p to upregulate the expression of NOTCH1. The results of this study provide new insight into the action mechanism of NEAT1 modulating T-ALL progression.","['Luo, Yun-Ya', 'Wang, Zhi-Hua', 'Yu, Qian', 'Yuan, Ling-Li', 'Peng, Hong-Ling', 'Xu, Yun-Xiao']","['Luo YY', 'Wang ZH', 'Yu Q', 'Yuan LL', 'Peng HL', 'Xu YX']",,"['Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410011, PR China.

This phenomenon, termed clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), is associated with greater risk for hematological malignancy and cardiovascular diseases, leading to decreased overall survival of the affected individuals. The most frequently mutated genes in CHIP cases include genes associated with epigenetic modification, cell signaling, DNA damage response and RNA splicing, which are all recurrently mutated in myeloid malignancies. Recent findings suggest that these genetic alleles exert pleiotropic effects on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) functions, transcriptional regulations, DNA damage responses and resistance to cellular stresses. Recent studies have uncovered the clinical relevance of CHIP in various settings during the management of hematological malignancies. Elucidating overall picture of clonal evolution based on CHIP will help developing preventive measures and novel treatments for hematological malignancies.","['Kunimoto, Hiroyoshi', 'Nakajima, Hideaki']","['Kunimoto H', 'Nakajima H']",,"['Department of Stem Cell and Immune Regulation, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-9 Fuku-ura, Kanazawa-ku Yokohama, Japan.

However, disease-specific risk factors in AML/MDS can further inform when MAC and RIC may yield differential outcomes. We analyzed HCT outcomes stratified by the Disease Risk Index (DRI) in 4387 adults (age 40 to 65 years) to identify the impact of conditioning intensity. In the low/intermediate-risk DRI cohort, RIC was associated with lower nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (hazard ratio [HR], .74; 95% confidence interval [CI], .62 to .88; P < .001) but significantly greater relapse risk (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.76; P < .001) and thus inferior disease-free survival (DFS) (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.33; P = .001). In the high/very high-risk DRI cohort, RIC was associated with marginally lower NRM (HR, .83; 95% CI, .68 to 1.00; P = .051) and significantly higher relapse risk (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.41; P = .002), leading to similar DFS using either RIC or MAC. These data support MAC over RIC as the preferred conditioning intensity for patients with AML/MDS with low/intermediate-risk DRI, but with a similar benefit as RIC in high/very high-risk DRI. Novel MAC regimens with less toxicity could benefit all patients, but more potent antineoplastic approaches are needed for the high/very-high risk DRI group.","['Bejanyan, Nelli', 'Zhang, Meijie', 'Bo-Subait, Khalid', 'Brunstein, Claudio', 'Wang, Hailin', 'Warlick, Erica D', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Nishihori, Taiga', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Dias, Ajoy', 'Copelan, Edward', 'Hale, Gregory', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Solh, Melhem', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Diaz, Miguel Angel', 'Ganguly, Siddhartha', 'Gore, Steven', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Hossain, Nasheed M', 'Kekre, Natasha', 'Savani, Bipin', 'Byrne, Michael', 'Kanakry, Christopher', 'Cairo, Mitchell S', 'Ciurea, Stefan', 'Schouten, Harry C', 'Bredeson, Christopher', 'Munker, Reinhold', 'Lazarus, Hillard', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'van Der Poel, Marjolein', 'Rizzieri, David', 'Yared, Jean A', 'Freytes, Cesar', 'Cerny, Jan', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Palmisiano, Neil D', 'Pawarode, Attaphol', 'Bacher, Vera Ulrike', 'Grunwald, Michael R', 'Nathan, Sunita', 'Wirk, Baldeep', 'Hildebrandt, Gerhard C', 'Seo, Sachiko', 'Olsson, Richard F', 'George, Biju', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Hourigan, Christopher S', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Litzow, Mark', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Saber, Wael', 'Weisdorf, Daniel']","['Bejanyan N', 'Zhang M', 'Bo-Subait K', 'Brunstein C', 'Wang H', 'Warlick ED', 'Giralt S', 'Nishihori T', 'Martino R', 'Passweg J', 'Dias A', 'Copelan E', 'Hale G', 'Gale RP', 'Solh M', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Diaz MA', 'Ganguly S', 'Gore S', 'Verdonck LF', 'Hossain NM', 'Kekre N', 'Savani B', 'Byrne M', 'Kanakry C', 'Cairo MS', 'Ciurea S', 'Schouten HC', 'Bredeson C', 'Munker R', 'Lazarus H', 'Cahn JY', 'van Der Poel M', 'Rizzieri D', 'Yared JA', 'Freytes C', 'Cerny J', 'Aljurf M', 'Palmisiano ND', 'Pawarode A', 'Bacher VU', 'Grunwald MR', 'Nathan S', 'Wirk B', 'Hildebrandt GC', 'Seo S', 'Olsson RF', 'George B', 'de Lima M', 'Hourigan CS', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Litzow M', 'Kebriaei P', 'Saber W', 'Weisdorf D']",,"['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplant and Cellular Immunotherapy, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.

We collected 40 cases of T-cell neoplasms diagnosed in the liver from five large academic institutions to assess the clinicopathologic features. The patients included 11 women and 29 men, with a median age of 54 (range: 2-75) years and a high mortality rate (31/37, 83.8%). Fourteen (35%) patients were diagnosed with hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), 13 (32.5%) peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), and 13 (32.5%) other types of T-cell neoplasms. Patients with HSTCL were much younger and had worse survival than PTCL-NOS and other T-cell neoplasms (P < 0.05). On imaging studies, 20 cases (50%) showed abnormalities, including 10 with mass lesions that correlated with normal or cholestatic pattern enzyme elevation. Histomorphological analysis revealed four main patterns; with the exception of mass forming lesions (pattern 4; n = 8), cases with sinusoidal predominant (pattern 1; n = 12), portal predominant with sinusoidal infiltrates (pattern 2; n = 13) or lobular aggregates (pattern 3; n = 5) demonstrated small to medium lymphocytes resembling a reactive/inflammatory process. In addition, we described two cases of T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia that mimicked HSTCL, and a case of aggressive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder that developed after chronic Epstein-barr virus (EBV) infection, suggesting the importance of EBV testing in some lymphoma cases. As the largest cohort of T-cell neoplasms in liver, our study provides critical data on disease frequency, distribution, and clinicopathologic features that are essential for accurate diagnosis.","['Li, Philippa', 'Zhang, Dongwei', 'Zhou, Jiehao', 'Li, Peng', 'Shen, Yulei', 'Pan, Zenggang', 'Evans, Andrew G', 'Liao, Xiaoyan']","['Li P', 'Zhang D', 'Zhou J', 'Li P', 'Shen Y', 'Pan Z', 'Evans AG', 'Liao X']",,"['Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.

Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) gene therapy (GT) using regulated lentiviral vectors (LVs) has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for CGD patients. We performed non-clinical Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and laboratory-grade studies to assess the safety and genotoxicity of LV targeting myeloid-specific Gp91(phox) expression in X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (XCGD) mice. We found persistence of gene-corrected cells for up to 1 year, restoration of Gp91(phox) expression and NADPH oxidase activity in XCGD phagocytes, and reduced tissue inflammation after LV-mediated HSPC GT. Although most of the mice showed no hematological or biochemical toxicity, a small subset of XCGD GT mice developed T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (2.94%) and myeloid leukemia (5.88%). No hematological malignancies were identified in C57BL/6 mice transplanted with transduced XCGD HSPCs. Integration pattern analysis revealed an oligoclonal composition with rare dominant clones harboring vector insertions near oncogenes in mice with tumors. Collectively, our data support the long-term efficacy of LV-mediated HSPC GT in XCGD mice and provide a safety warning because the chronic inflammatory XCGD background may contribute to oncogenesis.","['Jofra Hernandez, Raisa', 'Calabria, Andrea', 'Sanvito, Francesca', 'De Mattia, Fabiola', 'Farinelli, Giada', 'Scala, Serena', 'Visigalli, Ilaria', 'Carriglio, Nicola', 'De Simone, Maura', 'Vezzoli, Michela', 'Cecere, Francesca', 'Migliavacca, Maddalena', 'Basso-Ricci, Luca', 'Omrani, Maryam', 'Benedicenti, Fabrizio', 'Norata, Rossana', 'Rancoita, Paola Maria Vittoria', 'Di Serio, Clelia', 'Albertini, Paola', 'Cristofori, Patrizia', 'Naldini, Luigi', 'Gentner, Bernhard', 'Montini, Eugenio', 'Aiuti, Alessandro', 'Mortellaro, Alessandra']","['Jofra Hernandez R', 'Calabria A', 'Sanvito F', 'De Mattia F', 'Farinelli G', 'Scala S', 'Visigalli I', 'Carriglio N', 'De Simone M', 'Vezzoli M', 'Cecere F', 'Migliavacca M', 'Basso-Ricci L', 'Omrani M', 'Benedicenti F', 'Norata R', 'Rancoita PMV', 'Di Serio C', 'Albertini P', 'Cristofori P', 'Naldini L', 'Gentner B', 'Montini E', 'Aiuti A', 'Mortellaro A']",,"['San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; GLP Test Facility, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'GLP Test Facility, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; Pathology Unit, Department of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'GLP Test Facility, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'GLP Test Facility, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'GLP Test Facility, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'GLP Test Facility, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'GLP Test Facility, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; Pediatric Immunohematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'GLP Test Facility, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'University Centre for Statistics in the Biomedical Sciences, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'University Centre for Statistics in the Biomedical Sciences, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'GLP Test Facility, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'GLP Test Facility, San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; Non-Clinical Safety In Vivo Translation Research, Glaxo Smith Kline, Ware, UK.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; Medical School, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; Pediatric Immunohematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; Medical School, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.

Recently, decitabine or umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) seemed to be effective in these patients. However, few studies have added decitabine to myeloablative conditioning regimens for UCBT in patients with haematological malignancies not in remission. Therefore, the objective was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) using decitabine as part of a myeloablative conditioning regimen prior to salvaged unrelated UCBT at our centre. METHODS: We enrolled 20 consecutive patients with refractory/relapsed AML/MDS between 2013 and 2018. All patients were in non-remission state before transplantation. All transplants were performed with decitabine as part of the myeloablative conditioning regimen, which was decitabine + fludarabine/busulfan/cyclophosphamide. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: All patients achieved neutrophil and platelet engraftment. Incidence of grade III/IV acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) was 20.0%, which was also decreased compared to non-decitabine group (P = .025). The median follow-up time after UCBT was 29 months (range 14-64 months). The 2-year probability of GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) was higher in the decitabine group. Univariate showed that the decitabine group was associated with a higher GRFS than the non-decitabine group. The estimated probability of overall survival and relapse was 55% and 20.0%, respectively. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that addition of decitabine as part of the myeloablative conditioning regimen prior to UCBT for refractory/relapsed AML/MDS in patients who are not in remission is safe and might be an effective treatment option.","['Yao, Wen', 'Chu, Xiandeng', 'Fang, Xinchen', 'Zhu, Xiaoyu', 'Tang, Baolin', 'Wan, Xiang', 'Geng, Liangquan', 'Tong, Juan', 'Song, Kaidi', 'Zhang, Xuhan', 'Qiang, Ping', 'Sun, Guangyu', 'Liu, Huilan', 'Sun, Zimin']","['Yao W', 'Chu X', 'Fang X', 'Zhu X', 'Tang B', 'Wan X', 'Geng L', 'Tong J', 'Song K', 'Zhang X', 'Qiang P', 'Sun G', 'Liu H', 'Sun Z']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0866-5029'],"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Science and Medicine, University of Sciences and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.

Delayed incomplete responses with graft-versus-mastocytosis effect were published in a few cases. In this particular patient's report, we describe the direct evidence and potency of graft-versus-mastocytosis effect of donor lymphocyte infusions in a patient with systemic mastocytosis with associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN). In a 53-year-old female patient, an allogeneic stem cell transplantation after conventional induction treatment was performed for transformed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) during the course of polycythemia vera. After 6 years of remission period of AML and PV, the patient developed aleukemic mast cell leukemia and JAK2-positive myeloproliferative neoplasm (SM-AHN). We were able to achieve a sustained complete remission of SM-AHN lasting for 6 years with only donor lymphocyte infusions in a status of mixed chimerism. The patient is in a good clinical condition and remission. The potent graft-versus-mastocytosis effect in this patient resembles the favorable effect of donor lymphocyte infusions in relapsing chronic myeloid leukemia patients after transplantation. This patient is, to our knowledge, the first case showing the proof of principle of graft-versus-mastocytosis effect.","['Hagglund, Hans', 'Yavuz, Akif Selim', 'Dreimane, Arta', 'Malm, Claes', 'Sundin, Anders', 'Sander, Birgitta', 'Nilsson, Gunnar']","['Hagglund H', 'Yavuz AS', 'Dreimane A', 'Malm C', 'Sundin A', 'Sander B', 'Nilsson G']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9049-4654'],"['Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Section of Hematology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Section of Hematology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Linkoping University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Linkoping University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Radiology, Section for Molecular Imaging, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Division of Pathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Section of Hematology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Immunology and Allergy Division, Karolinska Institutet, and Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201201,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC7898829,['NOTNLM'],"['donor lymphocyte infusion', 'graft-versus-mastocytosis effect', 'systemic mastocytosis']",2020/10/04 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/10/03 12:05'],"['2020/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/03 12:05 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13528 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2021 Feb;106(2):290-293. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13528.

However, there is a lack of information about the utilisation of the recommended Australian antifungal prophylaxis guidelines in haematology outpatients. Objective To assess the impact of a weekly pharmacist review of high-risk adult haematology outpatients on the utilisation of appropriate antifungal prophylaxis. Setting Outpatient cancer centre, tertiary referral hospital in Sydney, Australia. Method A 3-month pre-and post-interventional study was conducted. A retrospective audit was conducted to obtain baseline utilisation of antifungal guidelines in adult haematology outpatients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome receiving chemotherapy. This was followed by a weekly pharmacist review over a 3-month period of all eligible outpatients assessing the appropriateness of antifungal agent, dose, use of therapeutic drug monitoring and presence of drug-interactions/contraindications. Recommendations to physicians were conveyed weekly and outcomes recorded. Main outcome measure Appropriate utilisation of antifungal prophylaxis guidelines in outpatient haematology patients before and after implementation of a 3-month weekly pharmacist review service. Results Forty patients were included in the retrospective group, equating to 348 reviews, while 42 patients equating to 269 reviews were included in the prospective group. Appropriate utilisation of antifungal prophylaxis guidelines increased from 31 to 54% post implementation of a pharmacist review (Odds Ratio = 2.44, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.07-5.58, p = 0.0344). The most common reason for nonadherence to guidelines in both groups was lack of therapeutic drug monitoring and failure to prescribe antifungal prophylaxis where indicated. The percentage of appropriate use of antifungal prophylaxis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia increased from 13 to 46% (p value < 0.01) after pharmacist intervention. The pharmacist made 153 recommendations from 269 reviews, with a percentage uptake of 40%. Moderate to severe drug interactions were identified in 19 reviews from 10 patients. One major azole antifungal-chemotherapy interaction was avoided. Conclusions Appropriate utilisation of antifungal prophylaxis guidelines can be improved through a regular pharmacist review. Future studies should identify whether improving adherence to antifungal guidelines leads to improved patient outcomes.","['Reslan, Zainab', 'Lindsay, Julian', 'Kerridge, Ian', 'Gellatly, Rochelle']","['Reslan Z', 'Lindsay J', 'Kerridge I', 'Gellatly R']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9259-7195'],"['Pharmacy Department, Royal North Shore Hospital, Level 1 ASB, Reserve Road, Sydney, NSW, Australia. zainab.reslan@health.nsw.gov.au.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. zainab.reslan@health.nsw.gov.au.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'National Centre for Infection in Cancer (NCIC), Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201003,Netherlands,Int J Clin Pharm,International journal of clinical pharmacy,101554912,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['*Ambulatory Care/standards', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Monitoring', '*Drug Utilization Review/standards', 'Guideline Adherence', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', '*Hematology/standards', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Inappropriate Prescribing', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/immunology/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Opportunistic Infections/immunology/microbiology/*prevention & control', '*Pharmacists', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality Indicators, Health Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Antifungal agents', 'Hematology', 'Invasive fungal infections', 'Practice guidelines', 'Prophylaxis']",2020/10/04 06:00,2021/07/28 06:00,['2020/10/03 05:33'],"['2020/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/03 05:33 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11096-020-01090-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11096-020-01090-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Pharm. 2020 Dec;42(6):1412-1418. doi: 10.1007/s11096-020-01090-5.

We therefore studied 937 patients with AML in complete remission transplanted using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen from an unrelated donor mismatched at a single allele. In a multivariate analysis, patient age, adverse karyotype and patient cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity were correlated with decreased leukaemia free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS). There was no significant difference in LFS or OS between patients transplanted from donors mismatched at HLA-A, -B, -C or -DRB1 in comparison to a HLA-DQB1 mismatched transplant. In a multivariate analysis, patients transplanted with a HLA-A mismatched donor had higher rates of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) than patients transplanted with a HLA-DQB1 mismatched donor.

When a new treatment indication depends on events over time, such as treatment failures, this design can introduce time-related biases in comparisons with external controls. METHODS: We describe two potential biases resulting from calendar time and choice of time zero. We illustrate these biases using simulated data, emulating those from a single-arm trial of the effectiveness of blinatumomab in treating relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia on the outcome of mortality. RESULTS: The trial compared 189 patients treated with blinatumomab with 1112 external historical control patients. First, calendar time was not concurrent, with the blinatumomab arm diagnosed during 2010-2014 and the control cohort during 1990-2013. The median survival under blinatumomab was 6.1 months compared with 3.3 months in the control arm, though for the latter it increased from 2.4 to 4.2 months over the 24-year period. Second, using the latest line of salvage treatment as cohort, entry for the control cohort introduces selection bias. The corresponding hazard ratio of death with blinatumomab compared with control was 0.56 (95% CI = 0.47, 0.67) but became 0.98 (95% CI = 0.83, 1.15) after redefining cohort entry by the matched line of salvage treatment rather than the latest line. CONCLUSION: While single-arm trials with external historical controls are gaining recognition, a proper understanding of time-related sources of bias is essential if such trials will be used to provide valid evidence for drug approval from regulatory agencies.","['Suissa, Samy']",['Suissa S'],,"['From the Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, and Departments of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bias', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', '*Research Design', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2020/10/04 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2020/10/03 05:28'],"['2020/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/03 05:28 [entrez]']","['10.1097/EDE.0000000000001267 [doi]', '00001648-202101000-00013 [pii]']",ppublish,Epidemiology. 2021 Jan;32(1):94-100. doi: 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001267.,,['CIHR/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a case of a 55-year-old female undergoing treatment for CD20+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who experienced a viral reactivation after receiving rituximab, cytarabine, and dasatinib. She was initially hospitalized with COVID-19 in April and developed a high antibody titer with two negative nasal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swabs for SARS-CoV-2 on discharge. After recovery, she resumed treatment in June for her leukemia, which included rituximab, cytarabine, and dasatinib. She promptly lost her COVID-19 antibodies, and her nasal PCR turned positive in June. She developed a severe COVID-19 pneumonia with lymphopenia, high inflammatory markers, and characteristic bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT, requiring high-flow nasal cannula and transfer to the intensive care unit. She received steroids, anticoagulation, and convalescent plasma, and within 48 h she was off oxygen. She was discharged home in stable condition several days later. Given the short time frame from leukemia treatment to PCR positivity and the low case rate in mid-June in New York City, reinfection appears to have been unlikely and SARS-CoV-2 reactivation is a possible explanation. This case illustrates the risks of treating recently recovered COVID-19 patients with immunosuppressive therapy, particularly lymphocyte- and antibody-depleting therapy, and raises new questions about the potential of SARS-CoV-2 reactivation.","['Lancman, Guido', 'Mascarenhas, John', 'Bar-Natan, Michal']","['Lancman G', 'Mascarenhas J', 'Bar-Natan M']",,"['Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine At Mount Sinai, 1 Gustave Levy Place, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine At Mount Sinai, 1 Gustave Levy Place, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine At Mount Sinai, 1 Gustave Levy Place, New York, NY, 10029, USA.

KoRV is genetically diverse with co-infection with up to ten envelope subtypes (A-J) possible; KoRV-A is the prototype endogenous form. KoRV-B, first found in a small number of koalas with an increased leukemia prevalence at one US zoo, has been associated with other cancers and increased chlamydial disease. To better understand the molecular epidemiology of KoRV variants and the effect of increased viral loads (VLs) on transmissibility and pathogenicity we developed subtype-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays and tested blood and tissue samples from koalas at US zoos (n = 78), two Australian zoos (n = 27) and wild-caught (n = 21) in Australia. We analyzed PCR results with available clinical, demographic, and pedigree data. RESULTS: All koalas were KoRV-A-infected. A small number of koalas (10.3%) at one US zoo were also infected with non-A subtypes, while a higher non-A subtype prevalence (59.3%) was found in koalas at Australian zoos. Wild koalas from one location were only infected with KoRV-A. We observed a significant association of infection and plasma VLs of non-A subtypes in koalas that died of leukemia/lymphoma and other neoplasias and report cancer diagnoses in KoRV-A-positive animals. Infection and VLs of non-A subtypes was not associated with age or sex. Transmission of non-A subtypes occurred from dam-to-offspring and likely following adult-to-adult contact, but associations with contact type were not evaluated. Brief antiretroviral treatment of one leukemic koala infected with high plasma levels of KoRV-A, -B, and -F did not affect VL or disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a significant association of non-A KoRV infection and plasma VLs with leukemia and other cancers. Although we confirm dam-to-offspring transmission of these variants, we also show other routes are possible. Our validated qPCR assays will be useful to further understand KoRV epidemiology and its zoonotic transmission potential for humans exposed to koalas because KoRV can infect human cells.","['Zheng, HaoQiang', 'Pan, Yi', 'Tang, Shaohua', 'Pye, Geoffrey W', 'Stadler, Cynthia K', 'Vogelnest, Larry', 'Herrin, Kimberly Vinette', 'Rideout, Bruce A', 'Switzer, William M']","['Zheng H', 'Pan Y', 'Tang S', 'Pye GW', 'Stadler CK', 'Vogelnest L', 'Herrin KV', 'Rideout BA', 'Switzer WM']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4591-8731'],"['Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA, MS G4530329, USA.', 'Quantitative Sciences and Data Management Branch, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, 30329, USA.', 'Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA, MS G4530329, USA.', 'San Diego Zoo Global, San Diego, CA, 92112, USA.', ""Disney's Animals, Science, and Environment, Bay Lake, FL, 32830, USA."", 'Los Angeles Zoo, 5333 Zoo Drive, Los Angeles, CA, 90027, USA.', 'Taronga Conservation Society Australia, Taronga Zoo, Mosman, NSW, 2088, Australia.', 'Taronga Conservation Society Australia, Taronga Zoo, Mosman, NSW, 2088, Australia.', 'San Diego Zoo Global, San Diego, CA, 92112, USA.', 'Laboratory Branch, Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA, MS G4530329, USA. bswitzer@cdc.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20201002,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Wild', 'Animals, Zoo', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Gammaretrovirus/classification/*genetics/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Genetic Variation', 'Male', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Phascolarctidae/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Prevalence', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/epidemiology/transmission/*veterinary/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/epidemiology/transmission/*veterinary/virology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Viral Load']",PMC7530975,['NOTNLM'],"['*Diversity', '*Endogenous', '*Envelope', '*Exogenous', '*Koala retrovirus', '*Pathogenesis', '*Subtypes', '*Transmission', '*Viral load']",2020/10/04 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/10/03 05:21'],"['2020/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/03 05:21 [entrez]', '2020/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-020-00541-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-020-00541-1 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2020 Oct 2;17(1):34. doi: 10.1186/s12977-020-00541-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past years the use of ASP in adult population has been mainly limited due to a poor knowledge of its safety profile and to an approximate management of ASP-related toxicity. Recently the development of pediatric-inspired treatment protocols for adult ALL has led to a wider use of ASP and since 2010 in Italy three national treatment protocols including Pegylated asparaginase (Peg-ASP) have been sequentially developed for adolescents, young adults and adults with Philadelphia-negative (Ph-) ALL. METHODS: With the aim to better understand the approach adopted in Italian centers for the management and prevention of Peg-ASP toxicity in adult ALL and to provide practical, consensus-based recommendations, a board of 6 Italian clinicians, with known expertise in adult ALL, designed 41 consensus statements on current challenges on the management of Peg-ASP associated toxicity. A group of 19 clinical experts in the field then rated these statements using the 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). RESULTS: The main Peg-ASP related issues identified by the board included: 1) clinician's attitudes; 2) toxicity profile; 3) hypersensitivity reactions; 4) hepatic toxicity; 5) hepatic and/or metabolic toxicity; 6) hemorrhagic/thrombotic toxicity; 7) pancreatitis; 8) metabolic toxicity management and prevention; 9) activity levels monitoring. Overall, participants agreed on most statements, except those addressing the potential contraindications to the treatment with Peg-ASP, such as patients with a diagnosis of chronic liver disease or the subsequent administrations of the drug in patients who had previously developed chemical pancreatitis or severe metabolic toxicity. Participants agreed that adult patients with ALL should receive Peg-Asp because this drug is essential to improve treatment results. CONCLUSIONS: The panel agreed that a critical evaluation of specific risk factors for each patient is crucial in order to reduce the risk of adverse events and specific advices in the management of Peg-ASP toxicities are reported.","['Lussana, Federico', 'Minetto, Paola', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Bassan, Renato']","['Lussana F', 'Minetto P', 'Ferrara F', 'Chiaretti S', 'Specchia G', 'Bassan R']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6510-8616'],"['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Azienda Socio Sanitaria Territoriale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Piazza OMS, 1, 24127, Bergamo, Italy. flussana@asst-pg23.it.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine (DiMI), University of Genoa, Genova, Italy.', 'IRCCS, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Cardarelli Hospital, Naples, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', ""Complex Operative Unit of Haematology, dell'Angelo Hospital and Santissimi Giovanni and Paolo Hospital, Mestre and Venice, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201002,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/*toxicity', 'Delphi Technique', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*toxicity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC7532578,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Pegylated asparaginase', 'Toxicity']",2020/10/04 06:00,2021/04/23 06:00,['2020/10/03 05:20'],"['2020/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/03 05:20 [entrez]', '2020/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-020-07461-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-07461-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Oct 2;20(1):956. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-07461-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, 470 and 1690 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the FeNP-treated HL60 and KG1a cells, respectively, and 2008 and 2504 DEGs were found in the PBNP-treated HL60 and KG1a cells, respectively. Among them, 14 common upregulated and 4 common downregulated DEGs were found, these genes were representative genes that play key roles in lipid metabolism (GBA and ABCA1), iron metabolism (FTL, DNM1, and TRFC), antioxidation (NQO1, GCLM, and SLC7A11), vesicle traffic (MCTP2, DNM1, STX3, and BIN2), and innate immune response (TLR6, ADGRG3, and DDX24). The gene ontology revealed that the mineral absorption pathway was significantly regulated by PBNPs in two cells, whereas the lipid metabolism and HIF-1 signaling pathways were significantly regulated by FeNPs in two cells. This study established the gene signatures of two kinds of nanoparticles in two leukemia cells, which revealed the main biological processes regulated by the two kinds of iron nanoparticles. These data shed new insights into the cytotoxicity of iron nanoparticles that differently regulate ROS in leukemia cells with variant stemness.","['Luo, Tao', 'Gao, Jinliang', 'Lin, Na', 'Wang, Jinke']","['Luo T', 'Gao J', 'Lin N', 'Wang J']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8675-6762', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3352-4690']","['State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200930,Switzerland,Nanomaterials (Basel),"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",101610216,,,,PMC7600526,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA-Seq', 'cytotoxicity', 'iron nanoparticles', 'leukemia']",2020/10/04 06:00,2020/10/04 06:01,['2020/10/03 01:01'],"['2020/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/03 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/04 06:01 [medline]']","['nano10101951 [pii]', '10.3390/nano10101951 [doi]']",epublish,Nanomaterials (Basel). 2020 Sep 30;10(10). pii: nano10101951. doi: 10.3390/nano10101951.,,['61971122/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that the replication ability of the viruses released in DF-1 cell cultures was listed in order as rGX15MM6-2 > rALV-B-Jenv > rGX14FF03. rGX15MM6-2 caused the most serious suppression of body weight gain, exhibited a significant negative effect on the development of immune organs (P < 0.05) and lower antibody responses to vaccinations with the commercial oil-emulsion vaccines (OEVs) (P<0.05) in the challenged chickens. The viral detection showed that the positive rate in blood from the birds infected with rALV-B-Jenv were respectively higher than those from the birds infected with rGX14FF03 (P < 0.05). At 25 wpi, similar tumors were found in the abdominal cavity of the birds in rGX15MM6-2 and rALV-B-Jenv groups.

Therapeutic approaches for the treatment of ATL have variable effectiveness and poor prognosis, thus requiring strategies to identify novel compounds with activity on infected cells. In this sense, we initially screened a small series of 25 1,2,3-triazole derivatives to discover cell proliferation inhibitors and apoptosis inducers in HTLV-1-infected T-cell line (MT-2) for further assessment of their effect on viral tax activity through inducible-tax reporter cell line (Jurkat LTR-GFP). Eight promising compounds (02, 05, 06, 13, 15, 21, 22 and 25) with activity >/=70% were initially selected, based on a suitable cell-based assay using resazurin reduction method, and evaluated towards cell cycle, apoptosis and Tax/GFP expression analyses through flow cytometry. Compound 02 induced S phase cell cycle arrest and compounds 05, 06, 22 and 25 promoted apoptosis. Remarkably, compounds 22 and 25 also reduced GFP expression in an inducible-tax reporter cell, which suggests an effect on Tax viral protein. More importantly, compounds 02, 22 and 25 were not cytotoxic in human hepatoma cell line (Huh-7). Therefore, the discovery of 3 active and non-cytotoxic compounds against HTLV-1-infected cells can potentially contribute, as an initial promising strategy, to the development process of new drugs against ATL.","['Dos Santos, Daiane Fernanda', 'de Pilger, Denise Regina Bairros', 'Vandermeulen, Charlotte', 'Khouri, Ricardo', 'Mantoani, Susimaire Pedersoli', 'Nunes, Paulo Sergio Goncalves', 'de Andrade, Peterson', 'Carvalho, Ivone', 'Casseb, Jorge', 'Twizere, Jean-Claude', 'Willems, Luc', 'Freitas-Junior, Lucio', 'Kashima, Simone']","['Dos Santos DF', 'de Pilger DRB', 'Vandermeulen C', 'Khouri R', 'Mantoani SP', 'Nunes PSG', 'de Andrade P', 'Carvalho I', 'Casseb J', 'Twizere JC', 'Willems L', 'Freitas-Junior L', 'Kashima S']",,"['Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Regional Blood Center of Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

However, the pharmacological target of PUB-SOs was still unidentified. Consequently, the objective of the present study was to identify and confirm the pharmacological target of the prototypical PUB-SO named 2-ethylphenyl 4-(3-ethylureido)benzenesulfonate (SFOM-0046) leading to the cell cycle arrest in S-phase. The antiproliferative and the cytotoxic activities of SFOM-0046 were characterized using the NCI-60 screening program and its fingerprint was analyzed by COMPARE algorithm. Then, human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (hDHODH) colorimetric assay, uridine rescuing cell proliferation and molecular docking in the brequinar-binding site were performed. As a result, SFOM-0046 exhibited a mean antiproliferative activity of 3.5 muM in the NCI-60 screening program and evidenced that leukemia and colon cancer cell panels were more sensitive to SFOM-0046. COMPARE algorithm showed that the SFOM-0046 cytotoxic profile is equivalent to the ones of brequinar and dichloroallyl lawsone, two inhibitors of hDHODH. SFOM-0046 inhibited the hDHODH in the low nanomolar range (IC50 = 72 nM) and uridine rescued the cell proliferation of HT-29, HT-1080, M21 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines in the presence of SFOM-0046. Finally, molecular docking showed a binding pose of SFOM-0046 interacting with Met43 and Phe62 present in the brequinar-binding site. In conclusion, PUB-SOs and notably SFOM-0046 are new small molecules hDHODH inhibitors triggering replication stresses and S-phase arrest.","['Bouzriba, Chahrazed', 'Larcher, Lauriane', 'Gagne-Boulet, Mathieu', 'Fortin, Sebastien']","['Bouzriba C', 'Larcher L', 'Gagne-Boulet M', 'Fortin S']",,"[""Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 0A6, Canada; Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Axe oncologie, Hopital Saint-Francois d'Assise, 10 Rue de l'Espinay, Quebec, QC G1L 3L5, Canada."", ""Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 0A6, Canada; Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Axe oncologie, Hopital Saint-Francois d'Assise, 10 Rue de l'Espinay, Quebec, QC G1L 3L5, Canada."", ""Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 0A6, Canada; Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Axe oncologie, Hopital Saint-Francois d'Assise, 10 Rue de l'Espinay, Quebec, QC G1L 3L5, Canada."", ""Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC G1V 0A6, Canada; Centre de recherche du CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Axe oncologie, Hopital Saint-Francois d'Assise, 10 Rue de l'Espinay, Quebec, QC G1L 3L5, Canada.

The study cohort consisted of 519 patients classified according to the intensity (intensive/moderate) of PCI and their response to PCI. The group treated with PCI had higher blast counts in the peripheral blood (PB) and had a lower overall survival (OS) rate (P < .001) and higher nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate (P = .035) compared with those without PCI (no PCI group). Approximately 40% of the patients (68 of 236) achieved a good response to PCI (good PCI group), and those patients had lower blast counts in the PB compared with the group with poor response to PCI (poor PCI group). OS in the good PCI group was comparable to that in the no PCI group and significantly better than that in the poor PCI group (hazard ratio, .54; 95% confidence interval, .39 to .77; P < .001). However, OS was significantly lower in patients with intensive/moderate PCI compared with the no PCI group. These results suggest that PCI increases NRM without decreasing the post-transplantation relapse rate, but may be beneficial for patients with lower blast counts in PB irrespective of its intensity.","['Tachibana, Takayoshi', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Ishizaki, Takuma', 'Najima, Yuho', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Doki, Noriko', 'Fujiwara, Shin-Ichiro', 'Kimura, Shun-Ichi', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Saito, Takeshi', 'Mori, Takehiko', 'Fujisawa, Shin', 'Sakaida, Emiko', 'Miyazaki, Takuya', 'Aotsuka, Nobuyuki', 'Gotoh, Moritaka', 'Watanabe, Reiko', 'Shono, Katsuhiro', 'Usuki, Kensuke', 'Tsukada, Nobuhiro', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro']","['Tachibana T', 'Kanda J', 'Ishizaki T', 'Najima Y', 'Tanaka M', 'Doki N', 'Fujiwara SI', 'Kimura SI', 'Onizuka M', 'Takahashi S', 'Saito T', 'Mori T', 'Fujisawa S', 'Sakaida E', 'Miyazaki T', 'Aotsuka N', 'Gotoh M', 'Watanabe R', 'Shono K', 'Usuki K', 'Tsukada N', 'Kanamori H', 'Kanda Y', 'Okamoto S']",,"['Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.

Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database, we compared HCT outcomes in 177 MPN-BP patients with 4749 patients with de novo AML, and 1104 patients with post-MDS AML, using multivariate regression analysis in 2 separate comparisons. In a multivariate Cox model, no difference in overall survival (OS) or relapse was observed in patients with MPN-BP vs de novo AML with active leukemia at HCT. Patients with MPN-BP in remission had inferior OS in comparison with de novo AML in remission (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.76]) due to higher relapse rate (HR, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.69-2.80]). MPN-BP patients had inferior OS (HR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.00-1.43]) and increased relapse (HR, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.31-1.96]) compared with post-MDS AML. Poor-risk cytogenetics were associated with increased relapse in both comparisons. Peripheral blood grafts were associated with decreased relapse in MPN-BP and post-MDS AML (HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.57-0.86]). Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was similar between MPN-BP vs de novo AML, and MPN-BP vs post-MDS AML. Total-body irradiation-based myeloablative conditioning was associated with higher NRM in both comparisons. Survival of MPN-BP after HCT is inferior to de novo AML in remission and post-MDS AML due to increased relapse. Relapse-prevention strategies are required to optimize HCT outcomes in MPN-BP.","['Gupta, Vikas', 'Kim, Soyoung', 'Hu, Zhen-Huan', 'Liu, Ying', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Beitinjaneh,

This study aims to investigate the effect of idarubicin on controlling hyperleukocytosis in induction therapy and the efficacy and safety of a risk-adapted attenuated consolidation chemotherapy. METHODS: We summarised the characteristics and long-term outcomes of 73 paediatric APL patients treated at our institution from February 2002 to October 2018, during which treatment protocols evolved over three periods and were defined as protocol A, B and C chronologically. All of the patients received an all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-arsenic trioxide (ATO) combination remission induction therapy, with hydroxyurea (group A) or idarubicin (group B and C) to control hyperleukocytosis. Consolidation chemotherapy was modified with risk-adapted attenuated intensity and minimised cumulative doses of anthracyclines for group C (144 mg/m(2) and 288 mg/m(2) of daunorubicin equivalents for standard- and high-risk patients, respectively). RESULTS: The median initial WBC, platelet count, and fibrinogen were 2.9 x 10(9)/L (range 0.9-158.3 x 10(9)/L), 32 x 10(9)/L (range 4-226 x 10(9)/L), and 160 mg/dL (range 53-549 mg/dL), respectively. High-risk and standard-risk were seen in 20.5% and 79.5% of patients, respectively. Three patients (4.1%) suffered early haemorrhagic death. At the end of induction therapy, 68 (93.2%) patients achieved haematologic complete remission (HCR). At a median follow-up of 91.97 months, the estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates for the whole cohort were 95.9 +/- 2.3% and 88.7 +/- 3.8%, respectively. A comparison of HCR rates and documented instances of toxicity between groups A and B + C showed no significant differences. However, idarubicin significantly reduced the peak WBC count (Z = - 3.292, P = 0.001) and duration of hyperleukocytosis (Z = - 2.827, P = 0.005). Estimated 3-year EFS (91.7 +/- 8.0%) and OS (100%) rates for group C were not significantly different from those for group B, whereas the risk of treatment-related infections was significantly reduced (chi(2) = 5.515, P = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Idarubicin (8-10 mg/m(2)/day for 2 days) for hyperleukocytosis control in induction therapy is safe and effective for paediatric APL. Risk-adapted attenuated consolidation chemotherapy is advocated.","['Zhang, Zhi-Xiao', 'Lu, Ai-Dong', 'Wu, Jun', 'Zuo, Ying-Xi', 'Jia, Yue-Ping', 'Zhang, Le-Ping', 'Qin, Jiong']","['Zhang ZX', 'Lu AD', 'Wu J', 'Zuo YX', 'Jia YP', 'Zhang LP', 'Qin J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7389-5859'],"[""Department of Paediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China. zhangleping@pkuph.edu.cn."", ""Department of Paediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China. qinjiong@pkuph.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20201002,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/*mortality', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukaemia', 'Attenuated consolidation chemotherapy', 'Idarubicin', 'Induction chemotherapy', 'Paediatric']",2020/10/03 06:00,2021/03/26 06:00,['2020/10/02 12:08'],"['2020/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/02 12:08 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-020-03406-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-020-03406-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2021 Apr;147(4):1189-1201. doi: 10.1007/s00432-020-03406-4.

This unique genetic context is responsible for the predisposition of people with Down syndrome to acute leukemia. Although, the research in this field has discovered some important pathogenic keys, the exact mechanism of this predisposition is not known. METHODS: In this study we applied functional enrichment analysis to evaluate the interactions between genes localized on chromosome 21, genes already identify as having a key role in acute leukemia of Down syndrome, miRNAs and signaling pathways implicated in cancer and cell development and found that miR-155 has a high impact in genes present on chromosome 21. Forward, we performed next generation sequencing on DNA samples from a cohort of patients diagnosed with acute leukemia of Down syndrome and in vitro functional assay using a CMK-86 cell line, transfected with either mimic or inhibitor of the microRNA-155-5p. RESULTS: Our results show that the epigenetic alteration of the TNF superfamily receptors in Down syndrome, which can be correlated to microRNA-155-5p aberrant activity, may play an important role in cell signaling and thus be linked to acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: Some genes, already shown to be mutated in AML-DS, are potential targets for miR-155. Our results show that the epigenetic alteration of the TNF superfamily receptors in Down syndrome may play an important role in cell signaling and thus be linked to acute myeloid leukemia.","['Sas,

The aim of this work was to evaluate the expression level of lncRNAs in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and to explore the function of candidate lncRNA PCAT18 in clinical diagnosis and prognosis of AML. METHODS: Noncoding RNA screening was performed by second-generation sequencing on adult newly diagnosed AML patients and healthy controls. GO and KEGG pathway analysis were performed for functional analysis of differentially regulated lncRNAs. The expression of candidate lncRNA PCAT18 was detected by real-time PCR. In K-562 and THP-1 cells, proliferation, and cell cycle analysis were performed using CCK-8 assay and Cell Cycle Assay Kit. RESULTS: The lncRNA expression profile of AML patients and healthy controls showed that six upregulated (>5-fold) and eight downregulated (<0.2-fold) lncRNAs. The candidate lncRNA PCAT18 showed higher expression in AML patients with NPM1 mutation and favorable-risk. RT-PCR revealed a significant increase of PCAT18 expression comparing to control cells. PCAT18 overexpression obviously promoted cell proliferation and PCAT18 knockdown decreased cell proliferation. The fraction of the S phases was increased in the PCAT18 overexpression group and decreased in the PCAT18 knockdown group. CONCLUSIONS: The candidate lncRNA PCAT18 in our study was firstly found upregulated in AML samples, that its overexpression promoted cell proliferation and G1/S transition. Further study of PCAT18 and its target mRNAs are needed to confirm the mechanism of PCAT18 in AML. PCAT18 may act as diagnostic and prognosis biomarker for AML.","['Zhang, Jihong', 'Zhang, Henan', 'Wang, Xiaohui', 'Zhao, Yue', 'Fu, Yu', 'Liu, Xuan']","['Zhang J', 'Zhang H', 'Wang X', 'Zhao Y', 'Fu Y', 'Liu X']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5921-2417'],"['Hematology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201002,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'G1 Phase/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', '*RNA, Long Noncoding/biosynthesis/genetics', '*RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'S Phase/genetics', 'THP-1 Cells']",,['NOTNLM'],"['PCAT18', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cell cycle', 'long noncoding RNA', 'proliferation']",2020/10/03 06:00,2021/02/04 06:00,['2020/10/02 08:36'],"['2020/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/02 08:36 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13305 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2020 Dec;42(6):858-865. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13305.

The bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA)-DRB3 was reportedly associated with susceptibility of various phenotypes of infections including bovine leukemia virus-induced lymphoma. However, the association of the remaining genes with various phenotypes has not been clarified due to the complicated genomic structure of the MHC class II region. Thus, in this study, we elucidated the MHC class II genomic structure, including the novel alleles and copy number variations (CNVs). We determined the copy numbers of BOLA-DQA2 (DQA2), BOLA-DQB (DQB2), BOLA-DQA5 (DQA5), BLA-DQB (DQB1), LOC100848815 (DQA1), and BOLA-DRB3 (DRB3) in 127 unrelated Holstein cows by TaqMan copy number assay. The genomes were sequenced using target next-generation sequencing (NGS) based on multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Combining the results of the copy numbers and alleles, we identified the BoLA alleles directly without haplotype estimation. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis between alleles and genes were performed. The CNVs of DQA2, DQB2, and DQA5 in Holstein cows were detected. The frequency of the whole gene deletion in DQA2, DQB2, and DQA5 was 35.4%, 93.7%, and 93.7%, respectively. After target NGS, we identified 37 alleles in the six genes. Fifteen novel alleles (40.5%) were not registered in the IPD-MHC Database. LD analysis showed strong LD among the DQB2*deletion, DQA5*deletion, and DRB3*27:03 alleles.

Historically, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) has been used to induce TIA production, but in the past, this has only been investigated in whole seedlings, cell culture, or hairy root culture. This study examines the effects of the phytohormones MeJA and ethylene on the induction of TIA biosynthesis and accumulation in the shoots and roots of 8-day-old seedlings of two varieties of C. roseus. Using LCMS and RT-qPCR, we demonstrate the importance of variety selection, as we observe markedly different induction patterns of important TIA precursor compounds. Additionally, both phytohormone choice and concentration have significant effects on TIA biosynthesis. Finally, our study suggests that several early-induction pathway steps as well as pathway-specific genes are likely to be transcriptionally regulated. Our findings highlight the need for a complete set of'omics resources in commonly used C. roseus varieties and the need for caution when extrapolating results from one cultivar to another.","['Fraser, Valerie N', 'Philmus, Benjamin', 'Megraw, Molly']","['Fraser VN', 'Philmus B', 'Megraw M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1422-5289', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2085-0873', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6793-6151']","['Molecular and Cellular Biology Program Oregon State University Corvallis OR USA.', 'Department of Botany and Plant Pathology Oregon State University Corvallis OR USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Oregon State University Corvallis OR USA.', 'Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing Oregon State University Corvallis OR USA.', 'Department of Botany and Plant Pathology Oregon State University Corvallis OR USA.', 'Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing Oregon State University Corvallis OR USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200928,England,Plant Direct,Plant direct,101716131,,,,PMC7520646,['NOTNLM'],"['Catharanthus roseus', 'ethephon', 'methyl jasmonate', 'vinca alkaloid induction']",2020/10/03 06:00,2020/10/03 06:01,['2020/10/02 05:47'],"['2020/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/02 05:47 [entrez]', '2020/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/pld3.267 [doi]', 'PLD3267 [pii]']",epublish,Plant Direct. 2020 Sep 28;4(9):e00267. doi: 10.1002/pld3.267. eCollection 2020 Sep.,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) not only have antileukemic activity on leukemia but also affect immune cells during therapeutic application. In this in vitro study, we showed that LBH589, a pan-HDACi, impaired the proliferation of human gammadeltaT cells, as well as their proportions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). At the specific concentration, LBH589 induced significant antileukemic activity of gammadeltaT cells against the HL-60 cells and Kasumi cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, the expression levels of activating receptor and molecules, as well as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression on gammadeltaT cells, were not affected by LBH589. After treatment with LBH589 for indicated times, extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK), Akt, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways in gammadeltaT cells were not activated.

Inhibition of Notch signaling by FLI-06, the gamma-secretase inhibitor, significantly reversed the enhanced antileukemic ability of gammadeltaT cells induced by LBH589.

Methods: This retrospective study evaluated T-cell immunological reconstitution in 106 adult patients who underwent allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation for haematologic malignancies between 2013 and 2016. Results: At D30, while conventional T cells reached similar median counts in Haplo-HCT recipients (n = 19) and controls (n = 87), gammadelta and Vdelta2(+) T-cell median counts were significantly lower in Haplo-HCT recipients and it persists at least until D360 for Vdelta2(+) T cells. PTCy induces a significant reduction in early gammadelta and Vdelta2(+) T-cell proliferation at D 7. At one year, the rate of increase in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral load was significantly higher in Haplo-HCT recipients as compared to controls (61% versus 34%, P = 0.02). In multivariate analysis, a higher gammadelta T-cell count (> 4.63 muL(-1)) at D30 was the only independent parameter significantly associated with a reduced risk of increase in EBV viral load (RR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15-0.76, P = 0.009). Conclusion: Immunological reconstitution of gammadelta T cells is significantly delayed after Haplo-HCT using PTCy and low-dose ATG and is associated with an increased risk of increase in EBV viral load.","['Stocker, Nicolas', 'Gaugler, Beatrice', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Farge, Agathe', 'Ye, Yishan', 'Ricard, Laure', 'Brissot, Eolia', 'Dulery, Remy', 'Sestili, Simona', 'Battipaglia, Giorgia', 'Mediavilla, Clemence', 'Paviglianiti, Annalisa', 'Banet, Anne', 'Van De Wyngaert, Zoe', 'Ledraa, Tounes', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Malard, Florent']","['Stocker N', 'Gaugler B', 'Labopin M', 'Farge A', 'Ye Y', 'Ricard L', 'Brissot E', 'Dulery R', 'Sestili S', 'Battipaglia G', 'Mediavilla C', 'Paviglianiti A', 'Banet A', 'Van De Wyngaert Z', 'Ledraa T', 'Mohty M', 'Malard F']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7316-5832', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3474-0002']","['INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA) Sorbonne Universite Paris France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP Paris France."", 'INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA) Sorbonne Universite Paris France.', 'INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA) Sorbonne Universite Paris France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP Paris France."", 'Acute Leukemia Working Party Paris Study Office European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Paris France.', 'INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA) Sorbonne Universite Paris France.', 'INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA) Sorbonne Universite Paris France.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center The First Affiliated Hospital School of Medicine Zhejiang University Hangzhou China.', 'INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA) Sorbonne Universite Paris France.', 'INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA) Sorbonne Universite Paris France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP Paris France."", 'INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA) Sorbonne Universite Paris France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP Paris France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP Paris France."", 'INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA) Sorbonne Universite Paris France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP Paris France."", 'INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA) Sorbonne Universite Paris France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP Paris France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP Paris France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP Paris France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP Paris France."", 'INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA) Sorbonne Universite Paris France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP Paris France."", 'INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA) Sorbonne Universite Paris France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP Paris France."", 'Acute Leukemia Working Party Paris Study Office European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Paris France.', 'INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA) Sorbonne Universite Paris France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire Hopital Saint-Antoine, AP-HP Paris France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200923,Australia,Clin Transl Immunology,Clinical & translational immunology,101638268,,,,PMC7511259,['NOTNLM'],"['Epstein-Barr virus', 'allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation', 'haploidentical haematopoietic cell transplantation', 'immune reconstitution', 'post-transplantation cyclophosphamide', 'gammadelta T cell']",2020/10/03 06:00,2020/10/03 06:01,['2020/10/02 05:45'],"['2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/02 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/cti2.1171 [doi]', 'CTI21171 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Transl Immunology. 2020 Sep 23;9(9):e1171. doi: 10.1002/cti2.1171. eCollection 2020.,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

A 48-year-old woman presented with pancytopenia and splenomegaly. The diagnosis was HCL with lymph node infiltration. Unlike previously described HCL cases, the current case showed strong expression of CD5 and cyclin D1 in the lymph nodes. The patient underwent cladribine chemotherapy, and the leukocyte count increased during and after treatment. The 8-month follow-up revealed that she had recovered well. This case highlights the distinctive immunophenotype of HCL infiltrating the lymph nodes and the potential misdiagnosis of HCL as mantle cell lymphoma.

To study potential carry-over effects of idelalisib and to assess the impact of pathway-inhibitor (PI) failure we performed a retrospective EBMT registry-based study. Patients with CLL who had a history of idelalisib treatment and received a first alloHCT between 2015 and 2017 were eligible. Data on 72 patients (median age 58 years) were analyzed. Forty percent of patients had TP53mut/del CLL and 64% had failed on at least one PI. No primary graft failure occurred. Cumulative incidences of acute GVHD degrees II-IV and chronic GVHD were 51% and 39%, respectively. Estimates for 2-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and cumulative incidences of relapse/progression (CIR) and non-relapse mortality NRM were 59%, 44%, 25%, and 31%. In univariate analysis, drug sensitivity was a strong risk factor. For patients who had failed neither PI treatment nor chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) the corresponding 2-year estimates were 73%, 65%, 15%, and 20%, respectively. In conclusion, idelalisib may be considered as an option for bridging therapy prior to alloHCT.

Further examination of the lymphomas from Trp53-null and Trp53-mDeltapro homozygous mutant mice revealed that 63% and 69% respectively of the isolated lymphomas were Testin negative, which is similar to reported rates in childhood T-ALL. Surprisingly, lymphomas from Trp53-Delta122 mice were frequently Testin positive (> 60%), suggesting that the presence of the Trp53-Delta122 protein appeared to mitigate the requirement for Tes silencing in lymphomagenesis. Quantitative RT-PCR results confirmed that this lack of Testin protein was due to Tes transcriptional silencing, although bisulfite sequencing demonstrated that this was not due to promoter methylation. These results are consistent with the Testin protein having lymphoid tumour suppressor activity in both mice and humans.","['Weeks, Robert J', 'Ludgate, Jackie L', 'Le Mee, Gwenn', 'Khanal, Rubina', 'Mehta, Sunali', 'Williams, Gail', 'Slatter, Tania L', 'Braithwaite, Antony W', 'Morison, Ian M']","['Weeks RJ', 'Ludgate JL', 'Le Mee G', 'Khanal R', 'Mehta S', 'Williams G', 'Slatter TL', 'Braithwaite AW', 'Morison IM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0474-9089'],"['Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. rob.weeks@otago.ac.nz.', 'Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.', 'Department of Pathology, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201001,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tes protein, mouse)', '0 (Trp53 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Silencing', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",PMC7530732,,,2020/10/03 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/10/02 05:39'],"['2019/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/02 05:39 [entrez]', '2020/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-73229-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-73229-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Oct 1;10(1):16255. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-73229-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognosis of CLL-associated PNP is dismal due to its refractory course and secondary infection and no standard treatment was recommended. We retrospectively reported six CLL with PNP cases from 842 cases of CLL including diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. The median time between the initial of CLL to PNP was 36 months while the median overall survival from the diagnosis of PNP was 26 months. And three cases died of lung infection while 5 developed pulmonary symptoms. And 5 cases received fludarabine-based chemotherapy before developing PNP, which suggesting fludarabine was one of potential causes of PNP. For the treatment, five patients were rescued by combined regimens including rituximab, methylprednisolone, immunoglobulin, fresh frozen plasma and the last received ibrutinib combined with short-term prednisone. Fludarabine-based regimen may be one of the potential causes of PNP. The combined regimen might shed a new light, while ibrutinib is a promising drug for CLL with PNP, but needs much more evidence. PNP should be carefully treated to guide early diagnosis and intervention for a better prognosis.","['Cao, Lei', 'Wang, Fei', 'Du, Xin-Yi', 'Zhu, Hua-Yuan', 'Wang, Li', 'Xu, Wei', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Fan, Lei']","['Cao L', 'Wang F', 'Du XY', 'Zhu HY', 'Wang L', 'Xu W', 'Li JY', 'Fan L']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9368-4987'],"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China. lijianyonglm@126.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China. lijianyonglm@126.com.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China. lijianyonglm@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, 210029, China. fanlei3014@126.com.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China. fanlei3014@126.com.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, 210029, China. fanlei3014@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201001,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Pemphigus/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",PMC7529904,,,2020/10/03 06:00,2021/01/02 06:00,['2020/10/02 05:38'],"['2020/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/02 05:38 [entrez]', '2020/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-73131-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-73131-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Oct 1;10(1):16357. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-73131-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL6 family cytokines mainly activate the JAK-STAT3 pathway via the coreceptor, gp130, and IL6 is known to activate the Src family kinase (SFK)-Yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway. The current study investigated the role of autocrine LIF in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) that highly expresses LIF. LIF knockdown had various effects on cancer cells, including profound changes in gene expression, suppression of cell proliferation, migration/invasion and sphere formation, and induction of apoptosis. Similar to IL6, LIF activated the SFK-YAP pathway as well as the JAK-STAT3 pathway. LIF-induced YAP activation was more important for cancer cell proliferation than LIF-induced STAT3 activation, and concomitant YAP and STAT3 activation completely compensated for the role of LIF in human ESCC growth. We also confirmed that SFK activation and LIF expression were correlated with YAP activation in human ESCC clinical samples. Furthermore, simultaneous inhibition of the SFK-YAP and JAK-STAT3 pathways in human ESCC cells was more effective at suppressing cell proliferation than single inhibition, and autocrine LIF signaling promoted human ESCC growth in vivo. Therefore, the LIF-SFK-YAP axis may represent a new therapeutic target for human ESCC. IMPLICATIONS: Autocrine LIF signaling promotes human ESCC progression via SFK-dependent YAP activation and is a new potential target of treatment for human ESCC.","['Kawazoe, Tetsuro', 'Saeki, Hiroshi', 'Oki, Eiji', 'Oda, Yoshinao', 'Maehara, Yoshihiko', 'Mori, Masaki', 'Taniguchi, Koji']","['Kawazoe T', 'Saeki H', 'Oki E', 'Oda Y', 'Maehara Y', 'Mori M', 'Taniguchi K']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5351-5089', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9763-9366', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1532-3537']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Keio University School of -Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of General Surgical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomic Pathology, Pathological Sciences, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Kyushu Central Hospital of the Mutual Aid Association of Public School Teachers, Minami-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery and Science, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Keio University School of -Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan. kotaniguchi@keio.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201001,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (YAP-Signaling Proteins)', '0 (YAP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",,,,2020/10/03 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2020/10/02 05:36'],"['2020/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/02 05:36 [entrez]']","['1541-7786.MCR-20-0186 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-20-0186 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2020 Dec;18(12):1876-1888. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-20-0186.

To understand the molecular networks driving leukemia in the Ebf1(+/-)Pax5(+/-) (dHet) mouse model for B-ALL, we interrogated the transcriptional profiles and chromatin status of leukemic cells, preleukemic dHet pro-B, and wild-type pro-B cells with the corresponding EBF1 and Pax5 cistromes. In dHet B-ALL cells, many EBF1 and Pax5 target genes encoding pre-BCR signaling components and transcription factors were down-regulated, whereas Myc and genes downstream from IL-7 signaling or associated with the folate pathway were up-regulated. We show that blockade of IL-7 signaling in vivo and methotrexate treatment of leukemic cells in vitro attenuate the expansion of leukemic cells. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed heterogeneity of leukemic cells and identified a subset of wild-type pro-B cells with reduced Ebf1 and enhanced Myc expression that show hallmarks of dHet B-ALL cells.

New research on the role of early life exposures and the ability of chemicals to act via multiple biological pathways, including immunosuppression, inflammation, and endocrine disruption as well as mutagenesis, further supports the potential for chemicals and chemical mixtures to influence disease. Epidemiologic observations, such as higher leukemia incidence in children living near roadways and industrial sources of air pollution, and new in vitro technologies that decode carcinogenesis at the molecular level, illustrate the diverse evidence that primary prevention of some cancers may be achieved by reducing harmful chemical exposures. The path forward requires cross-disciplinary approaches, increased environmental research investment, system-wide collaboration to develop safer economic alternatives, and community engagement to support evidence-informed action.

Here we present a case of SMZL and review relevant literature to provide a better recognition of this disease entity. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old Chinese female was admitted to our hospital with complaints of abdominal distension and acid reflux. Physical examinations and imaging investigations suggested the presence of splenomegaly. Laboratory workups revealed mildly reduced white blood cell count otherwise was not remarkable. The patient underwent splenectomy. Histological examination combined with immunohistochemical analysis of the resected spleen confirmed the diagnosis of SMZL. The patient recovered uneventfully during follow-ups. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the rarity and unspecific clinical features, SMZL is extremely challenging to be diagnosed preoperatively.

NOTCH undergoes remodeling, maturation, and trafficking in a series of post-translational events, including glycosylation, ubiquitination, and endocytosis. The regulatory modifications occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi precede the intramembrane gamma-secretase proteolysis and the transfer of active NOTCH to the nucleus. Hence, NOTCH proteins coexist in different subcellular compartments and undergo continuous relocation. Various factors, including ion concentration, enzymatic activity, and co-regulatory elements control Notch trafficking. Interfering with these regulatory mechanisms represents an innovative therapeutic way to bar oncogenic Notch signaling. In this review, we briefly summarize the role of Notch signaling in cancer and describe the protein modifications required for NOTCH to relocate across different subcellular compartments. We focus on the functional relationship between these modifications and the corresponding therapeutic options, and our findings could support the development of trafficking modulators as a potential alternative to the well-known gamma-secretase inhibitors.","['Pagliaro, Luca', 'Sorrentino, Claudia', 'Roti, Giovanni']","['Pagliaro L', 'Sorrentino C', 'Roti G']",,"['Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, 43126 Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, 43126 Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, 43126 Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200929,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endocytosis/genetics', 'Golgi Apparatus/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/genetics', 'Protein Transport/genetics', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",PMC7600097,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAD204520', '*NOTCH1', '*SERCA', '*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*thapsigargin', '*trafficking']",2020/10/03 06:00,2021/03/20 06:00,['2020/10/02 01:02'],"['2020/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/02 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9102212 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9102212 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Sep 29;9(10). pii: cells9102212. doi: 10.3390/cells9102212.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oncogenic mutations in the FLT3 gene resulting in constitutively active FLT3 variants are frequently found in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and correlate with patient's poor survival. Targeting FLT3 mutant leukaemic stem cells (LSC) is a key to efficient treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory AML. It is therefore essential to understand how LSC escape current therapies in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on mechanisms of FLT3 activity regulation and its cellular consequences. Furthermore, we discuss how aberrant FLT3 signalling cooperates with other oncogenic lesions and the microenvironment to drive haematopoietic malignancies and how this can be harnessed for therapeutical purposes.","['Muller, Jorg P', 'Schmidt-Arras, Dirk']","['Muller JP', 'Schmidt-Arras D']",,"['Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Biomedicine (CMB), Jena University Hospital, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel, 24118 Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200929,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7600363,['NOTNLM'],"['FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)', 'acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)', 'cancer cell vulnerability', 'haematopoietic niche', 'oncogenic signaling', 're-sistance development']",2020/10/03 06:00,2020/10/03 06:01,['2020/10/02 01:02'],"['2020/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/02 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/03 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12102806 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12102806 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Sep 29;12(10). pii: cancers12102806. doi: 10.3390/cancers12102806.,,"['SFB841, project C1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', 'Mu955/14-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to demonstrate that EPCAM IHC is a useful tool to guide the LS germ-line analysis when a loss of MSH2 expression was present. We retrospectively studied MSH2 and EPCAM IHC in a large series of 190 lesions composed of malignant neoplasms (102), precursor lesions of gastrointestinal (71) and extra-gastrointestinal origin (9), and benign neoplasms (8) from different organs of 71 patients suspicious of being LS due to MSH2 alterations. LS was confirmed in 68 patients, 53 with MSH2 mutations and 15 with EPCAM 3'-end deletions. Tissue microarrays were constructed with human normal tissues and their malignant counterparts to assist in the evaluation of EPCAM staining. Among 154 MSH2-negative lesions, 17 were EPCAM-negative, including 10 CRC and 7 colorectal polyps, and 5 of them showed only isolated negative glands. All lesions showing a lack of EPCAM expression belonged to patients with EPCAM 3'-end deletions. EPCAM IHC is a useful screening tool, with 100% specificity to identify LS patients due to EPCAM 3'-end deletions in MSH2-negative CRC and MSH2-negative colorectal polyps.","['Cuatrecasas, Miriam',

One of the features of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells is a reduction in telomere length which may result in increased genomic instability and progression of the disease. Aberrant telomere maintenance in CML is not fully understood and other mechanisms such as the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) are involved. In this work, we employed five BCR-ABL1-positive cell lines, namely K562, KU-812, LAMA-84, MEG-A2, and MOLM-1, commonly used in the laboratories to study the link between mutation, copy number, and expression of telomere maintenance genes with the expression, copy number, and activity of BCR-ABL1. Our results demonstrated that the copy number and expression of BCR-ABL1 are crucial for telomere lengthening. We observed a correlation between BCR-ABL1 expression and telomere length as well as shelterins upregulation. Next-generation sequencing revealed pathogenic variants and copy number alterations in major tumor suppressors, such as TP53 and CDKN2A, but not in telomere-associated genes. Taken together, we showed that BCR-ABL1 kinase expression and activity play a crucial role in the maintenance of telomeres in CML cell lines. Our results may help to validate and properly interpret results obtained by many laboratories employing these in vitro models of CML.","['Deregowska, Anna', 'Pepek, Monika', 'Pruszczyk, Katarzyna', 'Machnicki, Marcin M', 'Wnuk, Maciej', 'Stoklosa, Tomasz']","['Deregowska A', 'Pepek M', 'Pruszczyk K', 'Machnicki MM', 'Wnuk M', 'Stoklosa T']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8525-543X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8518-6670', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6918-5056']","['Department of Biotechnology, University of Rzeszow, Pigonia 1, 35-310 Rzeszow, Poland.', 'Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Trojdena 2a, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Trojdena 2a, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Nielubowicza 5, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Nielubowicza 5, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Trojdena 2a, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Nielubowicza 5, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Biotechnology, University of Rzeszow, Pigonia 1, 35-310 Rzeszow, Poland.', 'Department of Tumor Biology and Genetics, Medical University of Warsaw, Pawinskiego 7, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200929,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods', '*Telomere', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC7601685,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL1', '*alternative lengthening of telomeres', '*blast crisis', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*next-generation sequencing', '*shelterin complex', '*telomerase', '*telomere length']",2020/10/03 06:00,2021/07/17 06:00,['2020/10/02 01:01'],"['2020/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/02 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['genes11101145 [pii]', '10.3390/genes11101145 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2020 Sep 29;11(10). pii: genes11101145. doi: 10.3390/genes11101145.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To explore the lived experiences of Omani mothers who are parenting children with leukemia, using interpretative phenomenological analysis design. METHODS: Data were collected from 10 mothers who were parenting children with leukemia who shared their experiences through a face-to-face recorded interview. Data were analyzed using the interpretative phenomenological analysis approach methods. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged from the mothers' experiences: (1) unexpected shocking diagnosis; (2) life is not the same anymore; and (3) viable support systems. Mothers found their child's diagnosis to be shocking and terrifying. The diagnosis and treatment cast a shadow on the mothers' lives. Mothers abandoned their work and left their healthy children to their spouses. Mothers relied on other mothers also parenting children with cancer and on the support of the extended family and health team members to cope and prayed to God to help them overcome the calamity. CONCLUSION: The mothers perceived their life as changing immediately upon hearing their child's cancer diagnosis as they experienced a plethora of emotions. They sought support at various points during their child's illness to cope and overcome the challenges during the cancer treatment journey. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Pediatric oncology nurses can support mothers during their transition to caring for a child with leukemia and can provide the needed support to reduce maternal distress and increase effective coping with the challenges.","['Al Omari, Omar', 'Roach, Erna Judith', 'Shakman, Lina', 'Al Hashmi, Aysha', 'Sunderraj, Sheeba John', 'Francis, Frincy', 'Joseph, Mickael Antoine']","['Al Omari O', 'Roach EJ', 'Shakman L', 'Al Hashmi A', 'Sunderraj SJ', 'Francis F', 'Joseph MA']",,"[""Author's Affiliation: College of Nursing, Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Child', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/therapy', 'Mothers', '*Parenting']",,,,2020/10/02 06:00,2021/11/26 06:00,['2020/10/01 20:22'],"['2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/01 20:22 [entrez]']","['00002820-202111000-00016 [pii]', '10.1097/NCC.0000000000000898 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2021 Nov-Dec 01;44(6):E374-E381. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000898.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We examined the association between outdoor ALAN and a cancer strongly associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), in the prospective California Teachers Study cohort. METHODS: Outdoor ALAN was assigned to participant addresses at study baseline (1995-96) through use of the New World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness. Among 105,937 women followed from 1995 to 2015, linkage to the California Cancer Registry identified 873 incident cases of NHL. Age-stratified Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI) for overall NHL and the most common NHL subtypes; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). Multivariate analyses adjusted for previously reported subtype specific covariates (e.g. body mass index (BMI) for DLBCL). RESULTS: Compared to the lowest quintile, participants residing in the highest quintile of outdoor ALAN at baseline were more likely to develop NHL (HR = 1.32, 95 %CI = 1.07-1.63), and, in particular, DLBCL (HR = 1.87, 95 %CI = 1.16-3.02). The elevated risk for DLBCL remained statistically significant after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, BMI, and socioeconomic status (DLBCL:HR = 1.87, 95 %CI = 1.16-3.02, NHL:HR = 1.32, 95 %CI = 1.07-1.63). There was no association between ALAN and FL or CLL/SLL. CONCLUSION: DLBCL risk was elevated among women residing in neighborhoods with greater outdoor ALAN. Future research in circadian disruption and DLBCL may clarify potential biological processes implicated in this association.","['Zhong, Charlie', 'Franklin, Meredith', 'Wiemels, Joseph', 'McKean-Cowdin, Roberta', 'Chung, Nadia T', 'Benbow, Jennifer', 'Wang, Sophia S', 'Lacey, James V Jr', 'Longcore, Travis']","['Zhong C', 'Franklin M', 'Wiemels J', 'McKean-Cowdin R', 'Chung NT', 'Benbow J', 'Wang SS', 'Lacey JV Jr', 'Longcore T']",,"['Division of Health Analytics, Department of Computational and Quantitative Medicine, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, United States; Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States.

Parkinson disease protein 7 (DJ-1) and Lyn kinase were reported as the receptor-proximal events in IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) signals in human MC. Kaempferol, a natural flavonol mainly derived from the rhizome of traditional Chinese herb Kaempferia galanga L. (Zingiberaceae), has been known to inhibit allergic reactions, but it was limited to the receptor-distal signals on rat basophilic leukemia cells. A thorough investigation of the inhibitory effects of kaempferol on human MC has not been done. PURPOSE: To investigate the inhibitory effects of kaempferol on IgE-mediated anaphylaxis in vivo and in human MCs, as well as the mechanism underlying its effects, especially the receptor-proximal signals. METHODS: IgE-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and systemic anaphylaxis model were applied to elucidate the antiallergic activity of kaempferol in vivo. The degranulation assay, calcium imaging, the release of cytokines and chemokines on the laboratory of allergic disease 2 (LAD2) cells were used to evaluate the antiallergic effect of kaempferol in vitro. Western blot analysis was performed to investigate the DJ-1/Lyn signaling pathway and downstream molecules. Kinase activity assay, immunofluorescence, and molecular docking were conducted to confirm the influence of kaempferol on DJ-1/Lyn molecules. RESULTS: Kaempferol dose-dependently attenuated ovalbumin/IgE-induced mice paw swelling, primary MC activation from paw skin, as well as rehabilitated the hypothermia, and reduced the serum concentrations of histamine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-8, and monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1. Additionally, kaempferol suppressed IgE-mediated LAD2 cell degranulation and calcium fluctuation. Remarkably, kaempferol was found to bind with DJ-1 protein, and initially prevented DJ-1 from translocating to the plasma membrane, thereby inhibited full activation of Lyn, and eventually restrained those receptor-distal signaling molecules, involved Syk, Btk, PLCgamma, IP3R, PKC, MAPKs, Akt and NF-kappaB. CONCLUSION: Kaempferol could be used as a DJ-1 modulator for preventing MC-mediated allergic disorders through attenuating Lyn activation.","['Cao, Jiao', 'Li, Chaomei', 'Ma, Pengyu', 'Ding, Yuanyuan', 'Gao, Jiapan', 'Jia, Qianqian', 'Zhu, Jing', 'Zhang, Tao']","['Cao J', 'Li C', 'Ma P', 'Ding Y', 'Gao J', 'Jia Q', 'Zhu J', 'Zhang T']",,"[""School of Pharmacy, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China; Solomon H.

Currently, PCBs are among the most prominent environmental contaminants. Previously we showed that PCBs impair secretion of prostaglandins (PGs) at the oviduct. PGs are involved in the regulation of oviductal contractions and the synthesis of leukemia inhibitory factors LIF. Since oviductal contractions are crucial for gamete and embryo transport, and LIF is essential for embryo implantation, the direct effect of PCBs on oviductal motor activity and LIF mRNA expression were investigated. Oviductal strips and cells were taken from cows during the estrous cycle and were treated with PCBs at concentrations close to their environmental ranges. All the studied PCBs decreased the force of the contractions of the longitudinal and circular muscles of the isthmus. Additionally, these PCBs decreased the amplitude of the longitudinal muscle of the oviduct. Moreover, PCB-30-OH and PCB-153 increased the mRNA expression of LIF. Since PCBs inhibit the motor function of the oviduct and stimulate the synthesis of LIF, it is possible that PCBs can slow gamete or embryo transport and increase the potential for pathological embryo implantation in the oviduct.","['Wrobel, Michal Hubert', 'Mlynarczuk, Jaroslaw']","['Wrobel MH', 'Mlynarczuk J']",,"['Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research, Polish Academy of Sciences, Tuwima Street 10, 10-748 Olsztyn, Poland.

Cryoconservation of testicular cells before cancer treatment can preserve SSCs from treatment side effects. Different two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) culture systems of SSCs have been used in many species as a useful technique to in vitro spermatogenesis. We evaluated the proliferation of SSCs in 2D and 3D culture systems of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). testicular cells of four brain-dead patients cultivated in 2D pre-culture system, characterization of SSCs performed by RT-PCR, flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry and their functionality assessed by xenotransplantation to azoospermia mice. PRP prepared and dosimetry carried out to determine the optimized dose of PRP. After preparation of PRP scaffold, cytotoxic and histological evaluation performed and SSCs cultivated into three groups: control, 2D culture by optimized dose of PRP and PRP scaffold. The diameter and number of colonies measured and relative expression of GFRa1 and c-KIT evaluated by real-time PCR. Results indicated the expression of PLZF, VASA, OCT4, GFRa1 and vimentin in colonies after 2D pre-culture, xenotransplantation demonstrated proliferated SSCs have proper functionality to homing in mouse testes. The relative expression of c-KIT showed a significant increase as compared to the control group (*: p<0.05) in PRP- 2D group, expression of GFRa1 and c-KIT in PRP scaffold group revealed a significant increase as compared to other groups (***: p<0.001).

METHODS: Five patients underwent whole-body CT and thoraco-abdominal 4DCT. A planning target volume (PTV) including all bones and ABM was contoured on each whole-body CT. PRV of selected OAR (liver, heart, kidneys, lungs, spleen, stomach) were determined with 4DCT. Planning consisted of 9-10 full 6 MV photon VMAT arcs. Four plans were created for each patient with 12 Gy prescribed to the PTV, with or without an additional 4 Gy SIB to the ABM. Planning dose constraints were set on the OAR or on the PRV. Planning objective was a PTV Dmean < 110% of the prescribed dose, a PTV V110% < 50%, and OAR Dmean </= 50-60%. RESULTS: PTV Dmean < 110% was accomplished for most plans (n = 18/20), while all achieved V110%<50%. SIB plans succeeded to optimally cover the boost volume (median ABM Dmean = 16.3 Gy) and resulted in similar OAR sparing compared to plans without SIB (median OAR Dmean = 40-54% of the ABM prescribed dose). No statistically significant differences between plans optimized with constraints on OAR or PRV were found. CONCLUSIONS: Adding a 4 Gy SIB to the ABM for TMI is feasible with VMAT technique, and results in OAR sparing similar to plans without SIB. Setting dose constraints on PRV does not impair PTV dosimetric parameters.","['Jaccard, Maud', 'Lamanna, Giorgio', 'Kountouri, Melpomeni', 'Rouzaud, Michel', 'Miralbell, Raymond', 'Zilli, Thomas']","['Jaccard M', 'Lamanna G', 'Kountouri M', 'Rouzaud M', 'Miralbell R', 'Zilli T']",,"['Radiation Oncology, University Hospital of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.

Total marrow irradiation and total marrow and lymphoid irradiation represent more targeted forms of radiotherapy compared with total body irradiation that have the potential to decrease toxicity and escalate the dose to the bone marrow for high-risk patients. We review the technological basis and the clinical development of total marrow irradiation and total marrow and lymphoid irradiation, highlighting both the possible advantages as well as the current roadblocks for widespread implementation among transplantation units. The exact role of total marrow irradiation or total marrow and lymphoid irradiation in new conditioning regimens seems dependent on its technological implementation, aiming to make the whole procedure less time consuming, more streamlined, and easier to integrate into the clinical workflow. We also foresee a role for computer-assisted planning, as a way to improve planning and delivery and to incorporate total marrow irradiation and total marrow and lymphoid irradiation in multi-centric phase 2-3 trials.","['Wong, Jeffrey Y C', 'Filippi, Andrea R', 'Scorsetti, Marta', 'Hui, Susanta', 'Muren, Ludvig P', 'Mancosu, Pietro']","['Wong JYC', 'Filippi AR', 'Scorsetti M', 'Hui S', 'Muren LP', 'Mancosu P']",,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo and University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.

The potential interplay between ferroptosis and apoptosis remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the expression of a nuclear long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), LINC00618, is reduced in human leukemia and strongly increased by vincristine (VCR) treatment. Furthermore, LINC00618 promotes apoptosis by increasing the levels of BCL2-Associated X (BAX) and cleavage of caspase-3. LINC00618 also accelerates ferroptosis by increasing the levels of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) and iron, two surrogate markers of ferroptosis, and decreasing the expression of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). Interestingly, VCR-induced ferroptosis and apoptosis are promoted by LINC00618, and LINC00618 accelerates ferroptosis in a manner dependent upon apoptosis. LINC00618 attenuates the expression of lymphoid-specific helicase (LSH), and LSH enhances the transcription of SLC7A11 after the recruitment to the promoter regions of SLC7A11, further inhibiting ferroptosis. Knowledge of these mechanisms demonstrates that lncRNAs related to ferroptosis and apoptosis are critical to leukemogenesis and chemotherapy.","['Wang, Zuli', 'Chen, Xiaowen', 'Liu, Na', 'Shi, Ying', 'Liu, Yating', 'Ouyang, Lianlian', 'Tam, Samantha', 'Xiao, Desheng', 'Liu, Shuang', 'Wen, Feiqiu', 'Tao, Yongguang']","['Wang Z', 'Chen X', 'Liu N', 'Shi Y', 'Liu Y', 'Ouyang L', 'Tam S', 'Xiao D', 'Liu S', 'Wen F', 'Tao Y']",,"['Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, Ministry of Education, Department of Pathology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Hunan 410078, China; NHC Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis (Central South University), Cancer Research Institute and School of Basic Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China.', ""Shenzhen Institute of Pediatrics, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, 7019 Yi Tian Road, Shenzhen 518038, China; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, 7019 Yi Tian Road, Shenzhen 518038, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, Ministry of Education, Department of Pathology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Hunan 410078, China; NHC Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis (Central South University), Cancer Research Institute and School of Basic Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, Ministry of Education, Department of Pathology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Hunan 410078, China; NHC Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis (Central South University), Cancer Research Institute and School of Basic Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, Ministry of Education, Department of Pathology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Hunan 410078, China; NHC Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis (Central South University), Cancer Research Institute and School of Basic Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, Ministry of Education, Department of Pathology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Hunan 410078, China; NHC Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis (Central South University), Cancer Research Institute and School of Basic Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410078, China.', ""Department of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Cancer Invasion, Ministry of Education, Department of Pathology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Hunan 410078, China; Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medicine and Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, China.', ""Shenzhen Institute of Pediatrics, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, 7019 Yi Tian Road, Shenzhen 518038, China; Division of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, 7019 Yi Tian Road, Shenzhen 518038, China.

Our analyses revealed a continuous differentiation trajectory from Il18r1(+) ST2(-) ILCPs to Il18r(-) ST2(+) ILC2s, which was experimentally validated. Upon helminth infection, recruited and BM-derived cells generated the entire spectrum of ILC2s in parabiotic and shield chimeric mice, consistent with their potential role in the renewal of tissue ILC2s.

The smears showed many atypical lymphocytes with a plasmacytoid appearance. There were many large cells with round to reniform shaped nuclei having with hair-like cytoplasmic processes. Flow cytometry (FCM) revealed a clonal B cell population with light chain restriction and positive CD20, CD79b, CD22, CD11c, CD25, CD103, CD123, and CD200 markers.

IC50 values of Pred showed the strongest association with rs904419 (P = 4.34 x 10(-8) ), located between the FRMD4B and MITF genes. The median IC50 values of prednisolone for cell lines with rs904419 AA (n = 13), AG (n = 31) and GG (n = 28) genotypes were 0.089, 0.139 and 297 micromol/L, respectively. For dexamethasone sensitivity, suggestive association was observed for SNP rs2306888 (P = 1.43 x 10(-6) ), a synonymous SNP of the TGFBR3 gene. For NR3C1 gene expression, suggestive association was observed for SNP rs11982167 (P = 6.44 x 10(-8) ), located in the PLEKHA8 gene. These genetic variants may affect GC sensitivity of ALL cells and may give rise to opportunities in personalized medicine for effective and safe chemotherapy in ALL patients.","['Shinohara, Tamao', 'Urayama, Kevin Y', 'Watanabe, Atsushi', 'Akahane, Koshi', 'Goi, Kumiko', 'Huang, Meixian', 'Kagami, Keiko', 'Abe, Masako', 'Sugita, Kanji', 'Okada, Yukinori', 'Goto, Hiroaki', 'Minegishi, Masayoshi', 'Iwamoto, Shotaro', 'Inukai, Takeshi']","['Shinohara T', 'Urayama KY', 'Watanabe A', 'Akahane K', 'Goi K', 'Huang M', 'Kagami K', 'Abe M', 'Sugita K', 'Okada Y', 'Goto H', 'Minegishi M', 'Iwamoto S', 'Inukai T']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0714-1239', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4181-8111', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8591-1281', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4783-2184']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Social Medicine, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Graduate School of Public Health, St Luke's International University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Statistical Genetics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', ""Hematology/Oncology and Regenerative Medicine, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan."", 'Tohoku Block Center, Japanese Red Cross Society, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201001,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Japan', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics']",PMC7701530,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*genome-wide association studies', '*glucocorticoid sensitivity']",2020/10/02 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/10/01 17:18'],"['2020/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/01 17:18 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.15882 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2020 Nov;24(22):12920-12932. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.15882.

We compared late mortality in the North American Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) and British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (BCCSS). METHODS: Late mortality was assessed among 49 822 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed before 15 years of age from 1970 to 1999 (CCSS, n = 31 596; BCCSS, n = 18 226) using cumulative mortality probabilities (CM%) and adjusted ratios of the standardized mortality ratio. RESULTS: The all-cause CM% at 10 years from diagnosis was statistically significantly lower in the CCSS (4.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.5% to 5.0%) compared with the BCCSS (6.9%, 95% CI = 6.5% to 7.2%), attributable to a lower probability of death from recurrence or progression of the primary cancer, with statistically significant differences observed in survivors of leukemia, lymphoma, central nervous system tumors, and sarcoma. However, at 40 years from diagnosis, the CCSS had a greater CM% (22.3% vs 19.3%), attributable to a twofold higher risk of mortality from subsequent malignant neoplasms, cardiac and respiratory diseases, and other health-related causes. Differences increased when assessed by follow-up interval, with the CCSS faring worse as time-since-diagnosis increased. Finally, the gap in all-cause mortality widened more recently, with CCSS survivors diagnosed in 1990-1999 experiencing one-half the excess deaths observed in the BCCSS (ratios of the standardized mortality ratio = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.5 to 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that US survivors may have received more intensive regimens to achieve sustainable remission and cure, but the cost of this approach was a higher risk of death from late effects. Although the clinical impact of these differences is unclear, our results provide important evidence to aid the discussion of late effects management.","['Fidler-Benaoudia, Miranda M', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Winter, David L', 'Reulen, Raoul C', 'Leisenring, Wendy M', 'Chen, Yan', 'Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Hawkins, Michael M']","['Fidler-Benaoudia MM', 'Oeffinger KC', 'Yasui Y', 'Robison LL', 'Winter DL', 'Reulen RC', 'Leisenring WM', 'Chen Y', 'Armstrong GT', 'Hawkins MM']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9594-9881', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7717-8638', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1597-4081', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7328-0467', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7405-0906', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6496-4800']","['Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Departments of Oncology and Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK.', 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'School of Public Health, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, West Midlands, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,,PMC8096371,,,2020/10/02 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2020/10/01 17:16'],"['2020/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/01 17:16 [entrez]']","['5917026 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djaa151 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2021 May 4;113(5):562-571. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djaa151.,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Using a qualitative approach, we conducted 49 interviews with parents (n = 29 mothers, n = 20 fathers) from 31 families with a child (<18 years) with leukemia or CNS tumor. Interviews were conducted about 16 to 24 months after the end of the treatment. We used a semi-structured interview guideline and analyzed the data using content analysis. Average age of pediatric cancer patients was 5.5 years at the time of diagnosis; mean time since diagnosis was 3.5 years. Parents reported immediate impact of the disease on their children. Reintegration had gone along with delayed nursery/school enrollment or social challenges. In most cases reintegration was organized with a gradual increase of attendance. Due to exhaustion by obligatory activities, reintegration in leisure time activities was demanding and parents reported a gradual increase of activity level for their children. Parents described several barriers and facilitators influencing the reintegration process into nursery/school and leisure time activities (structural support, social support, health status, intrapersonal aspects). Although many children reintegrate well, the process takes lots of effort from parents and children. Childhood cancer survivors and their families should be supported after the end of intensive treatment to facilitate reintegration.","['Inhestern, Laura', 'Peikert, Mona L', 'Krauth, Konstantin A', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Rutkowski, Stefan', 'Kandels, Daniela', 'Bergelt, Corinna']","['Inhestern L', 'Peikert ML', 'Krauth KA', 'Escherich G', 'Rutkowski S', 'Kandels D', 'Bergelt C']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2513-7954'],"['Department of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Klinik Bad Oexen, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Swabian Children's Cancer Center, University Hospital Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany."", 'Department of Medical Psychology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201001,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Attitude', 'Brain Neoplasms/*psychology/rehabilitation', 'Cancer Survivors/*education/psychology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/rehabilitation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Schools/statistics & numerical data', '*Social Adjustment', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC7529258,,,2020/10/02 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/10/01 17:16'],"['2020/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/01 17:16 [entrez]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0239967 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-01993 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Oct 1;15(10):e0239967. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0239967. eCollection 2020.,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, TP53 gene mutations have been described as a potential predictive biomarker of better outcome in patients treated with a ten-day decitabine regimen., However, functional characteristics of TP53 mutant are heterogeneous, as reflected in multiple functional TP53 classifications and their impact in patients treated with azacitidine is less clear. We analyzed the therapeutic course and outcome of 279 patients treated with azacitidine between 2007 and 2016, prospectively enrolled in our regional healthcare network. By screening 224 of them, we detected TP53 mutations in 55 patients (24.6%), including 53 patients (96.4%) harboring high-risk cytogenetics. The identification of any TP53 mutation was associated with worse overall survival but not with response to azacitidine in the whole cohort and in the subgroup of patients with adverse karyotype. Stratification of patients according to three recent validated functional classifications did not allow the identification of TP53 mutated patients who could benefit from azacitidine. Systematic TP53 mutant classification will deserve further exploration in the setting of patients treated with conventional therapy and in the emerging field of therapies targeting TP53 pathway.","['Bories, Pierre', 'Prade, Nais', 'Lagarde, Stephanie', 'Cabarrou, Bastien', 'Largeaud, Laetitia', 'Plenecassagnes, Julien', 'Luquet, Isabelle', 'De Mas, Veronique', 'Filleron, Thomas', 'Cassou, Manon', 'Sarry, Audrey', 'Fornecker, Luc-Matthieu', 'Simand, Celestine', 'Bertoli, Sarah', 'Recher, Christian', 'Delabesse, Eric']","['Bories P', 'Prade N', 'Lagarde S', 'Cabarrou B', 'Largeaud L', 'Plenecassagnes J', 'Luquet I', 'De Mas V', 'Filleron T', 'Cassou M', 'Sarry A', 'Fornecker LM', 'Simand C', 'Bertoli S', 'Recher C', 'Delabesse E']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2252-0395'],"[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Reseau Onco-occitanie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Unite de biostatistique, Institut Claudius Regaud, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Unite de bioinformatique, Institut Claudius Regaud, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Unite de biostatistique, Institut Claudius Regaud, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'Unite de bioinformatique, Institut Claudius Regaud, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'Onco-Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", ""Service d'Onco-Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201001,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Registries', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",PMC7529302,,,2020/10/02 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/10/01 17:15'],"['2020/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/01 17:15 [entrez]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0238795 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-11937 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Oct 1;15(10):e0238795. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0238795. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Christian Recher has received research funding from Celgene, unrelated to this', 'study.

While many studies simultaneously perform bulk and single-cell sequencing, some studies have analyzed initial bulk data to identify which mutations to target in a follow-up single-cell sequencing experiment, thereby decreasing cost. Bulk data provide an additional untapped source of valuable information, composed of candidate phylogenies and associated clonal prevalence. Here, we introduce PhyDOSE, a method that uses this information to strategically optimize the design of follow-up single cell experiments. Underpinning our method is the observation that only a small number of clones uniquely distinguish one candidate tree from all other trees. We incorporate distinguishing features into a probabilistic model that infers the number of cells to sequence so as to confidently reconstruct the phylogeny of the tumor. We validate PhyDOSE using simulations and a retrospective analysis of a leukemia patient, concluding that PhyDOSE's computed number of cells resolves tree ambiguity even in the presence of typical single-cell sequencing errors. We also conduct a retrospective analysis on an acute myeloid leukemia cohort, demonstrating the potential to achieve similar results with a significant reduction in the number of cells sequenced. In a prospective analysis, we demonstrate the advantage of selecting cells to sequence across multiple biopsies and that only a small number of cells suffice to disambiguate the solution space of trees in a recent lung cancer cohort. In summary, PhyDOSE proposes cost-efficient single-cell sequencing experiments that yield high-fidelity phylogenies, which will improve downstream analyses aimed at deepening our understanding of cancer biology.","['Weber, Leah L', 'Aguse, Nuraini', 'Chia, Nicholas', 'El-Kebir, Mohammed']","['Weber LL', 'Aguse N', 'Chia N', 'El-Kebir M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9652-691X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1468-2407']","['Dept. of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, United States of America.', 'Dept. of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, United States of America.', 'Microbiome Program, Center for Individualized Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'Division of Surgical Research, Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, United States of America.', 'Dept. of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20201001,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genome/genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/classification/*genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods']",PMC7553321,,,2020/10/02 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2020/10/01 17:15'],"['2020/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/01 17:15 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008240 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-20-00693 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2020 Oct 1;16(10):e1008240. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008240. eCollection 2020 Oct.,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HOXA9 overexpression not only predicts poor diagnosis and outcome but also plays a critical role in leukemia transformation and maintenance. However, our current understanding of HOXA9 regulation in leukemia is limited, hindering development of therapeutic strategies. Here, we generated the HOXA9-mCherry knock-in reporter cell lines to dissect HOXA9 regulation. By utilizing the reporter and CRISPR/Cas9 screens, we identified transcription factors controlling HOXA9 expression, including a novel regulator, USF2, whose depletion significantly down-regulated HOXA9 expression and impaired MLLr leukemia cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of Hoxa9 rescued impaired leukemia cell proliferation upon USF2 loss. Cut and Run analysis revealed the direct occupancy of USF2 at HOXA9 promoter in MLLr leukemia cells. Collectively, the HOXA9 reporter facilitated the functional interrogation of the HOXA9 regulome and has advanced our understanding of the molecular regulation network in HOXA9-driven leukemia.","['Zhang, Hao', 'Zhang, Yang', 'Zhou, Xinyue', 'Wright, Shaela', 'Hyle, Judith', 'Zhao, Lianzhong', 'An, Jie', 'Zhao, Xujie', 'Shao, Ying', 'Xu, Beisi', 'Lee, Hyeong-Min', 'Chen, Taosheng',

These findings advanced both the development of prognostic parameters and the evolvement of therapy strategies. In this manuscript, we will present haematopoietic diseases as a prime example of this progress because they are relevant not only for their frequency but also for the evident diagnostic and therapeutic progress. The growing understanding of the underlying pathophysiology originates from the cellular pathology as it was described by, e.g., Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902). The identification of specific genomic changes in haematological malignancies and solid tumour diseases provided us with very sensitive tools for diagnostics and prediction of prognosis. Thus, it paved the way for individualized or personalized therapy. In particular, the rapid development of sequencing techniques for the human genome using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has contributed to this progress. Recently, artificial intelligence provided us with the tools to analyze the complex interactions of genomic alterations, course of the disease, and further factors of as yet unknown significance. With all these indisputable improvements, we should not neglect the holistic treatment mandate of personalized therapy, i.e., therapy appropriate to the individual. In this context, the treating physician should address relevant co-morbidities, the psychosocial embedding of the patient and his desire for treatment.","['Jager, Paul', 'Twarock, Soren', 'Haas, Rainer']","['Jager P', 'Twarock S', 'Haas R']",,"['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Dusseldorf, Medical Faculty, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Dusseldorf, Medical Faculty, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University of Dusseldorf, Medical Faculty, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,,IM,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', '*Microscopy', '*Neoplasms', '*Precision Medicine/trends', 'Prognosis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Myeloid malignancies', '*allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*artificial intelligence', '*diagnostic', '*next generation sequencing', '*prognosis', '*targeted therapies']",2020/10/02 06:00,2021/11/27 06:00,['2020/10/01 12:12'],"['2020/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/01 12:12 [entrez]']","['CDT-EPUB-110373 [pii]', '10.2174/1389450121666201001122816 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2021;22(2):202-213. doi: 10.2174/1389450121666201001122816.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, significant numbers of patients do not respond or eventually relapse. Strategies for improvement of treatment outcomes are required. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the main structural and functional features of blinatumomab, and its place in the treatment of ALL. Furthermore, prospects to increase the efficacy of blinatumomab are addressed. The developments in the field of bispecific antibodies and their possible implications for treatment of ALL are reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Better understanding the mechanisms of response and resistance to blinatumomab might help us to identify the group of patients benefiting most from treatment and to spare potentially toxic subsequent treatment strategies. Data emerging from ongoing clinical trials might change the treatment landscape of ALL and beyond. Early use of blinatumomab in frontline protocols with more advantageous treatment sequences and in combination with other targeted therapies might reduce the failure rates. Exponentially increasing number of novel treatment options and their possible combinations might complicate treatment decision-making without data from randomized trials.","['Chitadze, Guranda', 'Laqua, Anna', 'Lettau, Marcus', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Bruggemann, Monika']","['Chitadze G', 'Laqua A', 'Lettau M', 'Baldus CD', 'Bruggemann M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9609-4643', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3824-9923']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein , Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein , Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein , Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein , Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein , Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein , Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201104,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/adverse effects/economics/immunology/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/immunology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*T cells', '*T-cell engagers', '*bispecific antibodies', '*blinatumomab', '*cytokine release syndrome', '*immunotherapy', '*neurotoxicity']",2020/10/02 06:00,2021/06/05 06:00,['2020/10/01 12:12'],"['2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/01 12:12 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2020.1831380 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2020 Nov;13(11):1211-1233. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2020.1831380.

However, it is unclear whether an HID-HSC transplant also augments the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect among refractory/relapsed (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who are not in remission (NR). We conducted a retrospective analysis of 124 R/R AML patients with NR status who underwent HID-HSCT between April 2012 and December 2016 and compared these to 27 R/R AML patients who underwent an ISD-HSCT within the same timeframe. Among all of the patients, 68 (45.0%) had primary induction failure (PIF) and 83 (54.9%) were relapsed and had failed to respond to at least one cycle of salvage combination chemotherapy. Myeloablative conditioning regimens were administered to all patients. Here, we present a retrospective multivariate analysis of pre-transplantation risk factors and characteristics of all 151 patients and developed a predictive scoring system to predict patient survival. The median period of follow-up was 46 months for all patients. The HID cohort had a higher 5-year overall survival (OS) compared with the ISD cohort (48.6% +/- 4.6% vs 25.9% +/- 8.4, respectively; P = 0.017) and higher LFS (leukemia-free survival) (41.6% +/- 7.5% vs 25.9% +/- 8.4%, respectively; P = 0.019). There was no difference in the 5-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) (18.0% +/- 3.8% and 34.9% +/- 12.6%, respectively; P = 0.212) between the two group. However, the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIRs) was lower in the HID group compared with the ISD group (55.4% +/- 8.9% vs 67.3% +/- 9.9%, respectively; P = 0.021). Multivariate analysis showed three risk factors associated with OS and LFS: (1) ISD-HSCT, (2) use of a standardized conditioning regimen, and (3) less than 50% proportional reduction of blast cells in the bone marrow (BM). Based on these three risk factors, we developed a predictive scoring system for R/R AML patients undergoing HSCT. Patients who had a predictive score of 0 and 1 had a 66.6% +/- 4.5% and 44.1% +/- 3.6% OS rate at 5 years, respectively. Patients with a score >/= 2 had only a 4.4 +/- 0.2% OS rate at 5 years. An HID-HSCT had a better anti-leukemia effect among R/R AML patients with an NR status compared with an ISD-HSCT. We also identified pre-transplantation risk factors to delineate subgroups that could derive maximal benefit from HSCT.","['Lu, Yue', 'Zhao, Yan-Li', 'Zhang, Jian-Ping', 'Xiong, Min', 'Cao, Xing-Yu', 'Liu, De-Yan', 'Sun, Rui-Juan', 'Wei, Zhi-Jie', 'Zhou, Jia-Rui', 'Lu, Dao-Pei']","['Lu Y', 'Zhao YL', 'Zhang JP', 'Xiong M', 'Cao XY', 'Liu DY', 'Sun RJ', 'Wei ZJ', 'Zhou JR', 'Lu DP']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6827-8146'],"['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, China Si Pu Lan Road, Yanjiao Development Zone, Langfang, 065201, Hebei, China. dpluyue@sina.com.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, China Si Pu Lan Road, Yanjiao Development Zone, Langfang, 065201, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, China Si Pu Lan Road, Yanjiao Development Zone, Langfang, 065201, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, China Si Pu Lan Road, Yanjiao Development Zone, Langfang, 065201, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, China Si Pu Lan Road, Yanjiao Development Zone, Langfang, 065201, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, China Si Pu Lan Road, Yanjiao Development Zone, Langfang, 065201, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, China Si Pu Lan Road, Yanjiao Development Zone, Langfang, 065201, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, China Si Pu Lan Road, Yanjiao Development Zone, Langfang, 065201, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, China Si Pu Lan Road, Yanjiao Development Zone, Langfang, 065201, Hebei, China.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, China Si Pu Lan Road, Yanjiao Development Zone, Langfang, 065201, Hebei, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20201001,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/trends', 'Histocompatibility Testing/methods/trends', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*therapy', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Siblings', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods/trends', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical/*methods/trends', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Haplo-identical donor', 'Identical sibling donor', 'Predictive scoring system', 'Refractory or relapsed AML']",2020/10/02 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/10/01 05:40'],"['2020/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/01 05:40 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04283-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04283-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Dec;99(12):2911-2925. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04283-0.

Resistance to chemotherapy remains an important factor for treatment failure. The aim of the present study was to investigate drug resistance in Tcell ALL (TALL). Bioinformatics analysis of Oncomine and Gene Expression Omnibus data was performed to evaluate the expression of haematopoietic SH2 domain containing (HSH2D) in various lymphomas. HuT78 cells with HSH2D overexpression and or knockdown were constructed, and the effect on related downstream signalling molecules was detected. To study the effect of HSH2D on methotrexate (MTX) resistance, cell cycle and apoptosis analyses were conducted using flow cytometry, and MTT and EdU assays were used to detect the effect of MTX resistance and HSH2D gene expression on the biological function of HuT78 cells. Via the analysis of the data sets, it was identified that the expression of HSH2D was downregulated in TALL compared with Bcell ALL. Western blotting and reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR demonstrated that the overexpression of HSH2 resulted in the inhibition of CD28mediated IL2 activation. In related experiments with drugresistant cell lines, it was determined that HSH2D expression is necessary for HuT78 cells to be resistant to MTX. In conclusion, the results suggested that HSH2D serves an important role in the resistance of TALL to MTX, which provides a potential research target for the study of drug resistance of TALL.","['Wang, Jing', 'Xiong, Yiying']","['Wang J', 'Xiong Y']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, P.R.

However, some patients become resistant to imatinib therapy. To overcome this resistance, secondgeneration (dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) and thirdgeneration (ponatinib) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed and have been shown to be effective against refractory CML. Although these TKIs provide many benefits for patients with CML, advanced patients show resistance even to these TKIs. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed for the treatment of TKIresistant CML patients. AT9283 is a multitargeted kinase inhibitor with potent activity against Janus kinase (JAK), Aurora kinases, and Abl. In the present study, we showed that AT9283 significantly decreased the cell viability of both TKIsensitive and TKIresistant CML cells as determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. In addition, cell cycle analysis, Annexin V assay, and caspase3/7 activity assay revealed that AT9283 increased the cell population in the G2/M phase and induced apoptosis. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the decrease in cell viability upon treatment with AT9283 by western blotting. Interestingly, our results showed that AT9283 inhibited the expression of Aurora A, Aurora B, and downstream Histone H3 phosphorylation. In contrast, we observed no changes in the levels of BcrAbl, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK), and Akt phosphorylation. In addition, we found that AMG900, a selective Aurora A and Aurora B inhibitor, increased the G2/M phase cell population and induced apoptosis via inhibition of Aurora A and Aurora B in both TKIsensitive and TKIresistant CML cells. Our studies show that Aurora A and Aurora B are promising therapeutic targets for TKIsensitive and TKIresistant CML, and AT9283 may have potential clinical applications for the treatment of TKIresistant CML patients.","['Takeda, Tomoya', 'Tsubaki, Masanobu', 'Genno, Shuji', 'Nemoto, Chisato', 'Onishi, Yasuka', 'Yamamoto, Yuuta', 'Imano, Motohiro', 'Satou, Takao', 'Nishida, Shozo']","['Takeda T', 'Tsubaki M', 'Genno S', 'Nemoto C', 'Onishi Y', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Imano M', 'Satou T', 'Nishida S']",,"['Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kindai University School of Pharmacy, HigashiOsaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kindai University School of Pharmacy, HigashiOsaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kindai University School of Pharmacy, HigashiOsaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kindai University School of Pharmacy, HigashiOsaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kindai University School of Pharmacy, HigashiOsaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kindai University School of Pharmacy, HigashiOsaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Kindai University School of Medicine, Osakasayama, Osaka 5890014, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kindai University School of Medicine, Osakasayama, Osaka 5890014, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kindai University School of Pharmacy, HigashiOsaka, Osaka 5778502, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200818,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0', '(1-cyclopropyl-3-(3-(5-morpholin-4-ylmethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-y', 'l)urea)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase B)']",IM,"['Aurora Kinase A/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Aurora Kinase B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Urea/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*AT9283', '*Aurora A', '*Aurora B', '*imatinib']",2020/10/02 06:00,2021/07/07 06:00,['2020/10/01 05:39'],"['2020/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/01 05:39 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2020.7739 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2020 Nov;44(5):2211-2218. doi: 10.3892/or.2020.7739.

Recent work in a pediatric leukemia mouse model exposed a surprising potential application of histidine supplementation for cancer therapy enhancement. These findings demand a deeper reassessment of the physiological effects and potential drawbacks of histidine supplementation. As pertinent to this question, we discuss the safety of high doses of histidine and its relevant metabolic fates in the human body. We refrain from recommendations or final conclusions because comprehensive preclinical evidence for safety and efficacy of histidine supplementation is still lacking. However, we emphasize the incentive to study the safety of histidine supplementation and its potential to improve the clinical outcome of pediatric blood cancers through a simple dietary supplementation. The need for comprehensive preclinical testing of histidine supplementation in healthy and tumor-bearing mice is fundamental, and we hope that this review will facilitate such studies.","['Petrova, Boryana', 'Kanarek, Naama']","['Petrova B', 'Kanarek N']",,"[""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,"['4QD397987E (Histidine)', '816-90-0 (Formiminoglutamic Acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Dietary Supplements', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Formiminoglutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Histidine/adverse effects/*metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*amino acid', '*antifolate', '*cancer therapy', '*dietary supplement', '*folate', '*histidine', '*leukemia', '*methotrexate']",2020/10/02 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2020/10/01 05:39'],"['2019/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/01 05:39 [entrez]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['5913282 [pii]', '10.1093/jn/nxaa132 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nutr. 2020 Oct 1;150(Suppl 1):2580S-2587S. doi: 10.1093/jn/nxaa132.,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Although the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has substantially improved patients' prognosis, drug resistance remains one of the major challenges in CML therapy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of short non-coding RNAs acting as post-transcriptional regulators, are implicated in CML progression and drug resistance. The aim of the present study was to analyze the miRNA expression profiles of 45 treatment-naive CML patients in chronic phase (28 peripheral blood and 17 bone marrow samples) with respect to future response to imatinib therapy. Methods: TaqMan low density arrays were used to analyze the miRNA expression pattern of the patient samples. For selected microRNAs, reporter gene assays were performed to study their ability to regulate CML associated target genes. Results: Significant lower expression levels of miR-142-5p were identified in both, peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of future non-responders suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role of this miRNA. This was supported by reporter gene assays that identified the survival, proliferation and invasion promoting CML related genes ABL2, cKIT, MCL1 and SRI as targets of miR-142-5p and miR-365a-3p, the latter identified as potential biomarker in peripheral blood samples. Conclusion: MiR-142-5p and to a certain extend also miR-365a-3p were able to discriminate treatment-naive CML patients not responding to imatinib in the course of their treatment from patients, who responded to therapy. However, further large-scale studies should clarify if the identified miRNAs have the potential as predictive biomarkers for TKI resistance.","['Klumper, Theresa', 'Bruckmueller, Henrike', 'Diewock, Tobias', 'Kaehler, Meike', 'Haenisch, Sierk', 'Pott, Christiane', 'Bruhn, Oliver', 'Cascorbi, Ingolf']","['Klumper T', 'Bruckmueller H', 'Diewock T', 'Kaehler M', 'Haenisch S', 'Pott C', 'Bruhn O', 'Cascorbi I']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2182-9534'],"['Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, 24105 Kiel, Germany.grid.412468.d0000 0004 0646 2097', 'Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, 24105 Kiel, Germany.grid.412468.d0000 0004 0646 2097', 'Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, 24105 Kiel, Germany.grid.412468.d0000 0004 0646 2097', 'Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, 24105 Kiel, Germany.grid.412468.d0000 0004 0646 2097', 'Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, 24105 Kiel, Germany.grid.412468.d0000 0004 0646 2097', 'Department of Medicine II, Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, 24105 Kiel, Germany.grid.412468.d0000 0004 0646 2097', 'Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, 24105 Kiel, Germany.grid.412468.d0000 0004 0646 2097', 'Institute of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, 24105 Kiel, Germany.grid.412468.d0000 0004 0646 2097']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200926,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,,PMC7519530,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'Chemoresistance', 'Imatinib', 'Leukemia', 'miR-142-5p', 'miR-365a-3p']",2020/10/02 06:00,2020/10/02 06:01,['2020/10/01 05:37'],"['2020/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/01 05:37 [entrez]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-020-00183-1 [doi]', '183 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2020 Sep 26;9:26. doi: 10.1186/s40164-020-00183-1. eCollection 2020.,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anterior segment exam was also normal in both eyes. On funduscopy, foveal reflex was significantly reduced. On optical coherence tomography, subretinal fluid was evident in both eyes. Fluorescein angiography showed a hypofluorescent area compatible with subretinal fluid and multiple pinpoint hyper- and hypofluorescent dots surrounding the detached retina. After 4 days, we were informed that the patient had been admitted to a general hospital due to spontaneous ecchymosis and melena. On complete blood count, there was a high white cell count, thrombocytopenia, and low hemoglobin concentration with a probable diagnosis of leukemia. On bone marrow biopsy, ALL with B-cell precursor was confirmed. In conclusion, exudative retinal detachment can be a primary presentation of leukemia and/or lymphoma.

Herein, we report a rare chromosome abnormality with der(16)t(1;16)(q12;q11.2) in CML-BC. It has been demonstrated that this chromosomal abnormality is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis in other malignancies, such as Ewing sarcoma. A 70-year-old man with CML who had been treated with imatinib and dasatinib was admitted to our hospital after complaining for several weeks of fatigue and dyspnea and diagnosed with CML-BC. His tumor cells presented additional chromosomal abnormality with der(16)t(1;16)(q12;q11.2), which has never been reported in CML cases. We successfully treated him using cytotoxic agents combined with ponatinib, and this chromosome abnormality was detected via G-banding. Our patient has lived for over 8 months without any progression with ponatinib treatment alone. Although the biological function of this chromosomal abnormality remains unclear, the satellite DNA of 1q12, which induces genomic instability in other malignancies, and the loss of 16q may contribute to the disease progression of CML in this case.

Chromosomal abnormality monosomy 7 was also observed, in addition to Ph1. Despite treatment difficulties that were anticipated based on these findings, the patient had long-time complete molecular response (CMR) for approximately 5 years using chemotherapy and two tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib and dasatinib. Lymphocytes were elevated after the patient switched from imatinib to dasatinib, and a T-cell receptor (TCR) V beta gene repertoire analysis revealed oligoclonal expansion of effector and memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), including Wilms tumor 1-specific CTLs. More specifically, the two memory CTLs expressing TCR V beta 3 and V beta 7.1 gradually increased after dasatinib administration. The activation and maintenance of anti-leukemia immunity may have allowed the patient to obtain long-time CMR. These results highlight that obtaining memory CTLs for leukemia cells may lead to safe withdrawal from dasatinib in the patient.","['Jo, Tatsuro', 'Shioya, Haruna', 'Tominaga, Hiroo', 'Sakai, Takahiro', 'Hayashi, Shizuka', 'Matsuzaka, Kaori', 'Kaneko, Yohei', 'Matsuo, Masatoshi', 'Taguchi, Jun']","['Jo T', 'Shioya H', 'Tominaga H', 'Sakai T', 'Hayashi S', 'Matsuzaka K', 'Kaneko Y', 'Matsuo M', 'Taguchi J']",,"['Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory, Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory, Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory, Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory, Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory, Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory, Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagasaki Genbaku Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200819,Switzerland,Case Rep Oncol,Case reports in oncology,101517601,,,,PMC7506382,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytotoxic T lymphocyte', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'Wilms tumor 1', 'bcr-abl1']",2020/10/02 06:00,2020/10/02 06:01,['2020/10/01 05:37'],"['2020/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/01 05:37 [entrez]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000508997 [doi]', 'cro-0013-0990 [pii]']",epublish,Case Rep Oncol. 2020 Aug 19;13(2):990-996. doi: 10.1159/000508997. eCollection 2020 May-Aug.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 by S.

We generated STING V154M knock-in mice and showed that B cells carrying constitutively activated STING specifically degraded membrane-bound IgM, Igalpha, and Igbeta via SEL1L/HRD1-mediated ER-associated degradation (ERAD). B cells with activated STING were thus less capable of responding to BCR activation by phosphorylating Igalpha and Syk than those without activated STING. When immunized with T-independent antigens, STING V154M mice produced significantly fewer antigen-specific plasma cells and antibodies than immunized wild-type (WT) mice. We further generated B cell-specific STING(KO) mice and showed that STING(KO) B cells indeed responded to activation by transducing stronger BCR signals than their STING-proficient counterparts. When B cell-specific STING(KO) mice were T-independently immunized, they produced significantly more antigen-specific plasma cells and antibodies than immunized STING(WT) mice. Since both human and mouse IGHV-unmutated malignant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells downregulated the expression of STING, we explored whether STING downregulation could contribute to the well-established robust BCR signaling phenotype in malignant CLL cells. We generated a STING-deficient CLL mouse model and showed that STING-deficient CLL cells were indeed more responsive to BCR activation than their STING-proficient counterparts. These results revealed a novel B cell-intrinsic role of STING in negatively regulating BCR signaling in both normal and malignant B cells.","['Tang, Chih-Hang Anthony', 'Lee, Avery C', 'Chang, Shiun', 'Xu, Qin', 'Shao, Andong', 'Lo, Yun', 'Spalek, Walker T', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier A', 'Del Valle, Juan R', 'Hu, Chih-Chi Andrew']","['Tang CA', 'Lee AC', 'Chang S', 'Xu Q', 'Shao A', 'Lo Y', 'Spalek WT', 'Pinilla-Ibarz JA', 'Del Valle JR', 'Hu CA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9024-2932'],"['The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA, 19104, USA.

Here we propose a novel efficient and reproducible protocol for electrotransfection of lymphoblastoid, B-cell lymphoma, leukemia cell lines, and B cells from PBMCs. The proposed protocol requires neither costly equipment nor expensive reagents; it can be used with small or large plasmids. Transfection and viability rates of about 79% and 58%, respectively, have been routinely achieved by optimizing the salt concentration in the electrotransfection medium and the amount of plasmid used. A validation of the protocol was obtained via the generation of a TP53(-/)(-) RPMI8866 lymphoblastoid cell line which should prove useful in future hematological and blood cancer studies.","['Canoy, Reynand Jay', 'Andre, Franck', 'Shmakova, Anna', 'Wiels, Joelle', 'Lipinski, Marc', 'Vassetzky, Yegor', 'Germini, Diego']","['Canoy RJ', 'Andre F', 'Shmakova A', 'Wiels J', 'Lipinski M', 'Vassetzky Y', 'Germini D']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7162-074X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3313-2937', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3101-7043', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6157-1929']","['UMR 9018, CNRS, Univ.

EuroFlow has previously designed an AL orientation tube (ALOT) to guide toward the relevant classification panel and final diagnosis. In this study, we designed and validated an algorithm for automated (database-supported) gating and identification (AGI tool) of cell subsets within samples stained with ALOT. A reference database of normal peripheral blood (PB, n = 41) and bone marrow (BM; n = 45) samples analyzed with the ALOT was constructed, and served as a reference for the AGI tool to automatically identify normal cells. Populations not unequivocally identified as normal cells were labeled as checks and were classified by an expert. Additional normal BM (n = 25) and PB (n = 43) and leukemic samples (n = 109), analyzed in parallel by experts and the AGI tool, were used to evaluate the AGI tool. Analysis of normal PB and BM samples showed low percentages of checks (<3% in PB, <10% in BM), with variations between different laboratories. Manual analysis and AGI analysis of normal and leukemic samples showed high levels of correlation between cell numbers (r(2) > 0.95 for all cell types in PB and r(2) > 0.75 in BM) and resulted in highly concordant classification of leukemic cells by our previously published automated database-guided expert-supervised orientation tool for immunophenotypic diagnosis and classification of acute leukemia (Compass tool). Similar data were obtained using alternative, commercially available tubes, confirming the robustness of the developed tools. The AGI tool represents an innovative step in minimizing human intervention and requirements in expertise, toward a ""sample-in and result-out"" approach which may result in more objective and reproducible data analysis and diagnostics. The AGI tool may improve quality of immunophenotyping in individual laboratories, since high percentages of checks in normal samples are an alert on the quality of the internal procedures.","['Lhermitte, Ludovic', 'Barreau, Sylvain', 'Morf, Daniela', 'Fernandez, Paula', 'Grigore, Georgiana', 'Barrena, Susana', 'de Bie, Maaike', 'Flores-Montero, Juan', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Nierkens, Stefan', 'Burgos, Leire', 'Caetano, Joana', 'Gaipa, Giuseppe', 'Buracchi, Chiara', 'da Costa, Elaine Sobral', 'Sedek, Lukasz', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Aanei, Carmen-Mariana', 'van der Sluijs-Gelling, Alita', 'Delgado, Alejandro Hernandez', 'Fluxa, Rafael', 'Lecrevisse, Quentin', 'Pedreira, Carlos E', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J']","['Lhermitte L', 'Barreau S', 'Morf D', 'Fernandez P', 'Grigore G', 'Barrena S', 'de Bie M', 'Flores-Montero J', 'Bruggemann M', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Nierkens S', 'Burgos L', 'Caetano J', 'Gaipa G', 'Buracchi C', 'da Costa ES', 'Sedek L', 'Szczepanski T', 'Aanei CM', 'van der Sluijs-Gelling A', 'Delgado AH', 'Fluxa R', 'Lecrevisse Q', 'Pedreira CE', 'van Dongen JJM', 'Orfao A', 'van der Velden VHJ']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2498-0376', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1119-4387', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5336-261X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1001-7597']","['Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Institut National de Recherche Medicale U1151, Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, Institut National de Recherche Medicale U1151, Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'FACS/Stem Cell Laboratory, Kantonsspital Aarau, Aarau, Switzerland.', 'FACS/Stem Cell Laboratory, Kantonsspital Aarau, Aarau, Switzerland.', 'Cytognos SL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Cytognos SL, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Translational and Clinical Research Program, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC, CSIC-USAL), Cytometry Service, NUCLEUS, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Salamanca (USAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Networking Centre Consortium of Oncology (CIBERONC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology, Laboratory for Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Translational and Clinical Research Program, Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC, CSIC-USAL), Cytometry Service, NUCLEUS, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Salamanca (USAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Networking Centre Consortium of Oncology (CIBERONC), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Motol, Charles University, Prague, Czechia.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Applied Medical Research Center (CIMA), IDISNA, Clinica Universidad de Navarra (UNAV), Pamplona, Spain.', 'Hemato-Oncology Laboratory, Portuguese Institute of Oncology, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Tettamanti Research Center, Pediatric Clinic University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, MB, Italy.', 'Tettamanti Research Center, Pediatric Clinic University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, MB, Italy.', 'Pediatrics Institute IPPMG, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Av.

This regimen increases the clusterization of FLT3 within lipid rafts on the cell surface of primitive hematopoietic cells, which overactivates this receptor as well as the downstream JAK/STAT signaling known to enhance the transformation of MLL-AF9 knock-in cells. Treatment of mice on a HFD with Quizartinib, a potent inhibitor of FLT3 phosphorylation, inhibits the JAK3/STAT3, signaling and finally antagonizes the accelerated development of AML that occurred following the HFD regimen. We can therefore conclude that, on a mouse model of AML, a HFD enforces the FLT3 signaling pathway on primitive hematopoietic cells and, in turn, improves the oncogenic transformation of MLL-AF9 knock-in cells and the leukemia initiation.","['Hermetet, Francois', 'Mshaik, Rony', 'Simonet, John', 'Callier, Patrick', 'Delva, Laurent', 'Quere, Ronan']","['Hermetet F', 'Mshaik R', 'Simonet J', 'Callier P', 'Delva L', 'Quere R']",,"['Inserm UMR1231, Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC LabEx, Dijon, France.', 'Inserm UMR1231, Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'Inserm UMR1231, Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'Laboratoire de Genetique Chromosomique et Moleculaire, Plateau Technique de Biologie, CHU Dijon, Dijon, France.', 'Inserm UMR1231, Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France.', 'LipSTIC LabEx, Dijon, France.', 'Inserm UMR1231, Universite Bourgogne Franche-Comte, Dijon, France. ronan.quere@inserm.fr.', 'LipSTIC LabEx, Dijon, France. ronan.quere@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200930,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', '*Diet, High-Fat', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",PMC7528010,,,2020/10/02 06:00,2020/12/29 06:00,['2020/10/01 05:33'],"['2020/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/01 05:33 [entrez]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-73020-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-73020-4 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Sep 30;10(1):16187. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-73020-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metabolic profiling is often used to identify possible correlations between a compound's metabolic profile and pharmacologic activity. Direct-injection electron ionization-mass spectrometry (DI-EI-MS) is a novel metabolomics method useful for characterizing biological materials. This review demonstrates the establishment of a DI-EI-MS method for metabolic profiling using several closely related lichen species: Cladonia krempelhuberi, C. gracilis, C. pseudogymnopoda, and C. ramulosa. The qualitative DI-EI-MS method was used to profile major and/or minor constituents in extracts of lichen samples. Each lichen sample could be distinguished by altering the DI-EI-MS electron energy and examining the resulting data using one-way analysis of variance. We also attempted to predict pharmacologic activity using DI-EI-MS metabolomics. Blueberry leaf extracts inhibited the proliferation of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells. Blueberry leaf extracts could be distinguished by principal component analysis based on the absolute intensity of characteristic fragment ions. Twenty cultivars were categorized into four species, and the most appropriate discriminative marker m/z value for identifying each cultivar was selected statistically. Components extracted based on DI-EI-MS analyses could be used to construct a model to predict ATL cell bioactivity. These data suggest that the novel DI-EI-MS metabolomics method is suitable for identifying species of natural materials and predicting their pharmacologic activity. This approach could enhance public health by facilitating evaluations of pharmacologic activity and functionality, leading to the elimination of counterfeit products.","['Kai, Hisahiro']",['Kai H'],,"['Department of Pharmaceutical Health Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University of Health and Welfare.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,"['0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Biological Products/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Blueberry Plants/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lichens/*metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', '*Metabolomics/methods', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['adult T-cell leukemia', 'blueberry', 'direct-injection electron ionization-mass spectrometry', 'lichen', 'metabolomics']",2020/10/02 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/10/01 05:30'],"['2020/10/01 05:30 [entrez]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1248/yakushi.20-00165 [doi]'],ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 2020;140(10):1251-1258. doi: 10.1248/yakushi.20-00165.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All the doubly linked cardenolides (11-17) except for 14 showed more potent activity than the other cardenolides. A comparison of the activities of 11, 14 and 16 revealed that the presence of hydroxy or acetoxy functional groups at C-16 led to a decrease in the activity. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) value of calotropin (11) against MT-2 cells was comparable to the potency of the clinical antineoplastic drug doxorubicin. The cytotoxic effect of 11 toward normal mononuclear cells obtained from the peripheral blood (PB-MNCs) was observed at a concentration 6 to 12 times higher than that used to induce growth inhibition against MT-1 and MT-2 cells. The proportions of annexin V-positive cells after 72 h of treatment with 11 were increased, indicating that it significantly induced apoptosis in MT-1 and MT-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Cell cycle experiments demonstrated that 11 arrested MT-1 and MT-2 cells at the G2/M phase. Therefore, compound 11 may be a promising candidate for the treatment of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.","['Nakano, Daisuke', 'Ishitsuka, Kenji', 'Takashima, Maya', 'Arima, Rie', 'Satou, Aya', 'Tsuchihashi, Ryota', 'Okawa, Masafumi', 'Tamura, Kazuo', 'Kinjo, Junei']","['Nakano D', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Takashima M', 'Arima R', 'Satou A', 'Tsuchihashi R', 'Okawa M', 'Tamura K', 'Kinjo J']",,"['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University.', 'Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Disease, Fukuoka University.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cardenolides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Asclepias', 'Cardenolides/isolation & purification/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Humans', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Asclepias curassavica', 'adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'cardenolide', 'screening']",2020/10/02 06:00,2021/07/07 06:00,['2020/10/01 05:30'],"['2020/10/01 05:30 [entrez]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1248/bpb.b20-00465 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2020;43(10):1609-1614. doi: 10.1248/bpb.b20-00465.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emodin, the predominant compound of traditional medicine rhubarb, was reported to inhibit the multidrug resistance by downregulating P-glycoprotein of K562/ADM cells with overexpression of P-glycoprotein in our previous studies. In the present study, we found that emodin can be a potential inhibitor for the imatinib-resistance in K562/G01 cells which are the imatinib-resistant subcellular line of human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells with overexpression of breakpoint cluster region-abelson (Bcr-Abl) oncoprotein. Emodin greatly enhanced cell sensitivity to imatinib, suppressed resistant cell proliferation and increased potentiated apoptosis induced by imatinib in K562/G01 cells. After treatment of emodin and imatinib together, the levels of p-Bcr-Abl and Bcr-Abl were significantly downregulated. Moreover, Bcr-Abl important downstream target, STAT5 and its phosphorylation were affected. Furthermore, the expression of Bcr-Abl and signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) related molecules, including c-MYC, MCL-1, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), Bcl-2 and caspase-3, were changed. Emodin also decreased Src expression and its phosphorylation. More importantly, emodin simultaneously targeted both the ATP-binding and allosteric sites on Bcr-Abl by molecular docking, with higher affinity with the myristoyl-binding site for enhanced Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition. Overall, these data indicated emodin might be an effective therapeutic agent for inhibiting resistance to imatinib in CML treatment.","['Wang, Xin-Yi', 'Sun, Gui-Bin', 'Wang, Ya-Jing', 'Yan, Fang']","['Wang XY', 'Sun GB', 'Wang YJ', 'Yan F']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, School of pharmacology, China Pharmaceutical University.', 'Nanjing Syrois Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, School of pharmacology, China Pharmaceutical University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'KA46RNI6HN (Emodin)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/physiology', 'Emodin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Genes, abl/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Molecular Docking Simulation/methods', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['allosteric inhibition', 'breakpoint cluster region-abelson tyrosine kinase', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'emodin', 'imatinib-resistance', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription 5']",2020/10/02 06:00,2021/07/07 06:00,['2020/10/01 05:30'],"['2020/10/01 05:30 [entrez]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1248/bpb.b20-00325 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2020;43(10):1526-1533. doi: 10.1248/bpb.b20-00325.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until now, no information concerning provirus mutations of HTLV-2 and its consequences, as well as those of HTLV-1/2 in HIV-coinfected individuals, had been described. Therefore, we searched for these mutations in provirus samples of 44 HIV/HTLV-1- and 25 HIV/HTLV-2-coinfected individuals. Using protocols well established for amplification and sequencing of segments of the LTR, env, and tax regions, we searched for defective type 1 particles that retain LTRs and lack internal sequences and type 2 particles that lack the 5'LTR region. In addition, using as references the prototypes ATK (HTLV-1) and Mo (HTLV-2), we searched for point mutations in the LTR and synonyms and nonsynonymous mutations and non-sense mutations in env and tax regions. Defective HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 provirus type 1 or 2 was detected in 31.8% of HIV/HTLV-1- and 32.0% of HIV/HTLV-2-coinfected individuals. Synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations were identified mostly in HTLV-2 and associated with lower levels of specific antibodies. No non-sense mutations that resulted in premature termination of Env and Tax proteins were detected. On the contrary, mutation in the stop codon of Tax2a produced a long protein characteristic of the HTLV-2c subtype. The clinical significance of these mutations in coinfected individuals remains to be defined, but they confirmed the lower sensitivity of serological and molecular diagnostic tests in HIV/HTLV-1/2 coinfections.IMPORTANCE HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are endemic to Brazil, and they have different effects in HIV/AIDS disease progression. HIV/HTLV-1 has been described as accelerating the progression to AIDS and death, while HIV/HTLV-2 slows the progression to AIDS. Provirus mutations of HTLV-1 were implicated in severe leukemia development and in problems in the diagnosis of HTLV-1; in contrast, provirus mutations of HTLV-2 had not been confirmed and associated with problems in HTLV-2 diagnosis or disease outcome. Nevertheless, data obtained here allowed us to recognize and understand the false-negative results in serologic and molecular tests applied for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 diagnosis. Defective proviruses, as well as synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations, were associated with the diagnosis deficiencies. Additionally, since HIV-1 and HTLV-1 infect the same cells (CD4 positive), the production of HIV-1 pseudotypes with HTLV-1 envelope glycoprotein during HIV/HTLV-1 coinfection cannot be excluded. Defective provirus of HTLV-2 and Tax2c is speculated to influence progression to AIDS.","['Campos, Karoline Rodrigues', 'Caterino-de-Araujo, Adele']","['Campos KR', 'Caterino-de-Araujo A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5461-1937', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0155-6580']","['Laboratorio de Pesquisa em HTLV, Centro de Imunologia, Instituto Adolfo Lutz, Coordenadoria de Controle de Doencas, Secretaria de Estado da Saude, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Pesquisa em HTLV, Centro de Imunologia, Instituto Adolfo Lutz, Coordenadoria de Controle de Doencas, Secretaria de Estado da Saude, Sao Paulo, Brazil adele.caterino@ial.sp.gov.br.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200930,United States,mSphere,mSphere,101674533,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Brazil', 'Coinfection/virology', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*virology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Point Mutation', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC7529439,['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV', '*HTLV-1', '*HTLV-2', '*coinfection', '*diagnostic impairment', '*human T-lymphotropic virus 1', '*human T-lymphotropic virus 2', '*provirus mutation', '*sequencing']",2020/10/02 06:00,2021/07/21 06:00,['2020/10/01 05:30'],"['2020/10/01 05:30 [entrez]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['5/5/e00923-20 [pii]', '10.1128/mSphere.00923-20 [doi]']",epublish,mSphere. 2020 Sep 30;5(5). pii: 5/5/e00923-20. doi: 10.1128/mSphere.00923-20.,['Copyright (c) 2020 Campos and Caterino-de-Araujo.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alvocidib has shown clinical activity in a timed sequential regimen with cytarabine and mitoxantrone in relapsed/refractory and newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but has not been studied in combination with traditional 7+3 induction therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multiinstitutional phase I dose-escalation study of alvocidib on days 1-3 followed by 7+3 (cytarabine 100 mg/m(2)/day i.v. infusion days 5-12 and daunorubicin 60 mg/m(2) i.v. days 5-7) was performed in newly diagnosed AML </=65 years. Core-binding factor AML was excluded. RESULTS: There was no MTD on this study; the recommended phase II dose of alvocidib was 30 mg/m(2) i.v. over 30 minutes followed by 60 mg/m(2) i.v. infusion over 4 hours. There was one dose-limiting toxicity of cytokine release syndrome. The most common grade >/=3 nonhematologic toxicities were diarrhea (44%) and tumor lysis syndrome (34%). Overall, 69% (22/32) of patients achieved complete remission (CR). In an exploratory cohort, eight of nine (89%) patients in complete remission had no measurable residual disease, as determined by a centralized flow cytometric assay. Clinical activity was seen in patients with secondary AML, AML with myelodysplastic syndrome-related changes, and a genomic signature of secondary AML (50%, 50%, and 92% CR rates, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Alvocidib can be safely administered prior to 7+3 induction with encouraging clinical activity. These findings warrant further investigation of alvocidib combinations in newly diagnosed AML.

Such targeted therapies have shown long-term relapse-free survival in patients with B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. However, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) represents a serious, potentially life-threatening side effect often associated with CAR T-cell therapy. CRS manifests as a rapid (hyper)immune reaction driven by excessive inflammatory cytokine release, including IFNgamma and IL6. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Many cytokines implicated in CRS are known to signal through the JAK-STAT pathway. Here we study the effect of blocking JAK pathway signaling on CAR T-cell proliferation, antitumor activity, and cytokine levels in in vitro and in vivo models. RESULTS: We report that itacitinib, a potent, selective JAK1 inhibitor, was able to significantly and dose-dependently reduce levels of multiple cytokines implicated in CRS in several in vitro and in vivo models. Importantly, we also report that at clinically relevant doses that mimic human JAK1 pharmacologic inhibition, itacitinib did not significantly inhibit proliferation or antitumor killing capacity of three different human CAR T-cell constructs (GD2, EGFR, and CD19). Finally, in an in vivo model, antitumor activity of CD19-CAR T cells adoptively transferred into CD19(+) tumor-bearing immunodeficient animals was unabated by oral itacitinib treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data suggest that itacitinib has potential as a prophylactic agent for the prevention of CAR T cell-induced CRS, and a phase II clinical trial of itacitinib for prevention of CRS induced by CAR T-cell therapy has been initiated (NCT04071366).","['Huarte, Eduardo', ""O'Connor, Roddy S"", 'Peel, Michael T', 'Nunez-Cruz, Selene', 'Leferovich, John', 'Juvekar, Ashish', 'Yang, Yan-Ou', 'Truong, Lisa', 'Huang, Taisheng', 'Naim, Ahmad', 'Milone, Michael C', 'Smith, Paul A']","['Huarte E', ""O'Connor RS"", 'Peel MT', 'Nunez-Cruz S', 'Leferovich J', 'Juvekar A', 'Yang YO', 'Truong L', 'Huang T', 'Naim A', 'Milone MC', 'Smith PA']",,"['Incyte Research Institute, Wilmington, Delaware. ehuarte@incyte.com.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Incyte Research Institute, Wilmington, Delaware.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Incyte Research Institute, Wilmington, Delaware.', 'Incyte Research Institute, Wilmington, Delaware.', 'Incyte Research Institute, Wilmington, Delaware.', 'Incyte Research Institute, Wilmington, Delaware.', 'Incyte Corporation, Wilmington, Delaware.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Incyte Research Institute, Wilmington, Delaware.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200930,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Azetidines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (INCB039110)', '0 (Isonicotinic Acids)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Azetidines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokine Release Syndrome/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*adverse effects', 'Isonicotinic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC7895329,,,2020/10/02 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/10/01 05:30'],"['2020/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/10/01 05:30 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-20-1739 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-1739 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2020 Dec 1;26(23):6299-6309. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-1739.

We conducted a phase Ib study of the PLK1 inhibitor, onvansertib, in combination with either low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) or decitabine in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Onvansertib was administered orally, in escalating doses, on days 1-5 in combination with either LDAC (20 mg/m(2); days 1-10) or decitabine (20 mg/m(2); days 1-5) in a 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint was to evaluate first-cycle dose-limiting toxicities and the MTD. Secondary and exploratory endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics, antileukemic activity, and response biomarkers. RESULTS: Forty patients were treated with onvansertib (12-90 mg/m(2)) in combination with LDAC (n = 17) or decitabine (n = 23). Onvansertib was well tolerated with most grades 3 and 4 adverse events related to myelosuppression. In the decitabine arm, the MTD was established at 60 mg/m(2), and 5 (24%) of the 21 evaluable patients achieved complete remission with or without hematologic count recovery. Decrease in mutant circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) during the first cycle of therapy was associated with clinical response. Engagement of the PLK1 target, TCTP, was measured in circulating blasts and was associated with greater decrease in bone marrow blasts. CONCLUSIONS: The onvansertib and decitabine combination was well tolerated and had antileukemic activity particularly in patients with target engagement and decreased mutant ctDNA following treatment.

Leucovorin and MTX are structural analogues, possibly competing for cellular transport and intracellular metabolism. We hypothesize that Leucovorin accumulates during consecutive courses, which might result in a lower MTX uptake. METHODS: We prospectively measured red blood cell (RBC) folate and MTX levels during four HD-MTX and Leucovorin courses in 43 patients treated according the DCOG ALL-11 protocol with 2-weekly HD-MTX (5 g/m(2)/dose) and Leucovorin (15 mg/m(2)/dose) using LC-MS/MS. We estimated a linear mixed model to assess the relationship between these variables over time. RESULTS: Both RBC MTX-PG and folate levels increased significantly during protocol M. MTX-PG2-5 levels increased most substantially after the first two HD-MTX courses (until median 113.0 nmol/L, IQR 76.8-165.2) after which levels plateaued during the 3(d) and 4th course (until median 141.3 nmol/L, IQR 100.2-190.2). In parallel, folate levels increased most substantially after the first two HD-MTX courses (until median 401.6 nmol/L, IQR 163.3-594.2) after which levels plateaued during the 3(d) and 4th course (until median 411.5 nmol/L, IQR 240.3-665.6). The ratio folate/MTX-PG decreased significantly over time, which was mostly due to the relatively higher increase (delta) of MTX-PG. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the increase in RBC folate levels does not seem to have a large effect on RBC MTX levels. Future studies, assessing competition of Leucovorin and MTX on other cellular mechanisms which might negatively affect treatment efficacy, are necessary.","['Oosterom, N', 'Fiocco, M', 'Kloos, R Q H', 'van der Sluis, I M', 'Pieters, R', 'van Zelst, B D', 'Smith, D E C', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M', 'de Jonge, R', 'Heil, S G']","['Oosterom N', 'Fiocco M', 'Kloos RQH', 'van der Sluis IM', 'Pieters R', 'van Zelst BD', 'Smith DEC', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'de Jonge R', 'Heil SG']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9871-1887'],"['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Postbus 113, 3720 AC Bilthoven, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

In addition, three known cholestane glycosides (9-11) were isolated and identified. The structures of the new compounds were determined based on spectroscopic data and chemical transformations.

The antiproliferative properties of these metal compounds were assessed against two leukemia cell lines, i.e., CCRF-CEM and its multidrug-resistant counterpart, CEM/ADR5000. Interestingly, potent cytotoxic effects were disclosed for both series of compounds against leukemia cells, with IC50 values generally falling in the low-micromolar range, the gold derivatives being on the whole more effective than the silver analogues. Some initial structure-function relationships were drawn. Subsequently, the ability of the study compounds to inhibit the three main catalytic activities of the proteasome was investigated. Different patterns of enzyme inhibition emerged for the various metal complexes. Notably, gold compounds were able to inhibit effectively both the trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like proteasome activities, being less effective toward the caspase-like catalytic activity. In most cases, a significant selectivity of the study compounds toward the proteasome proteolytic activities was detected when compared to other proteases.

Given that AML is a stem cell-driven disease, recent studies have addressed the effects of atRA on leukemic stem cells (LSCs). atRA promoted stemness of MLL-AF9-driven AML in an Evi1-dependent manner but had the opposite effect in Flt3-ITD/Nup98-Hoxd13-driven AML. Overexpression of the stem cell-associated transcription factor EVI1 predicts a poor prognosis in AML, and is observed in different genetic subtypes, including cytogenetically normal AML. Here, we therefore investigated the effects of Evi1 in a mouse model for cytogenetically normal AML, which rests on the combined activity of Flt3-ITD and Npm1c mutations. Experimental expression of Evi1 on this background strongly promoted disease aggressiveness. atRA inhibited leukemia cell viability and stem cell-related properties, and these effects were counteracted by overexpression of Evi1. These data further underscore the complexity of the responsiveness of AML LSCs to atRA and point out the need for additional investigations which may lay a foundation for a precision medicine-based use of retinoids in AML.","['Nguyen, Chi Huu', 'Grandits, Alexander M', 'Vassiliou, George S', 'Staber, Philipp B', 'Heller, Gerwin', 'Wieser, Rotraud']","['Nguyen CH', 'Grandits AM', 'Vassiliou GS', 'Staber PB', 'Heller G', 'Wieser R']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4125-224X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9929-1861', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4337-8022', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6729-7708', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8742-5631', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4384-6658']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Wellcome Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0AW, UK.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200928,Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,,,,PMC7600968,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'EVI1', 'FLT3-ITD', 'MECOM', 'all-trans retinoic acid', 'leukemia stem cells']",2020/10/02 06:00,2020/10/02 06:01,['2020/10/01 01:00'],"['2020/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/01 01:00 [entrez]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines8100385 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines8100385 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2020 Sep 28;8(10). pii: biomedicines8100385. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines8100385.,,"['MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_17230/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'P 28256/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'P-28256/Austrian Science Fund']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To self-renew, leukemia cells must continuously activate genes that were previously active in their mother cells. Here, we describe the circuitry of a transactivation system responsible for oncogenic self-renewal. MLL recruits RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) to unmethylated CpG-rich promoters by its CXXC domain and activates transcription by transcriptional regulators, including the AF4 family/ENL family/P-TEFb complex, DOT1L, and p300/CBP histone acetyl transferases. MOZ also targets a broad range of CpG-rich promoters through association with RNAP2 and MLL. Leukemic fusion proteins such as MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-AFX constitutively activate CpG-rich promoters by aberrantly recruiting p300/CBP. Pharmacological inhibition of MLL or DOT1L induces differentiation of MOZ-TIF2-transformed cells. These results reveal that activation of unmethylated CpG-rich promoters mediated by MLL is the central mechanism of oncogenic self-renewal in MOZ-rearranged leukemia and indicate that the molecularly targeted therapies intended for MLL-rearranged leukemia can be applied for MOZ-rearranged leukemia.","['Miyamoto, Ryo', 'Okuda, Hiroshi', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Kawamura, Takeshi', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Kitamura, Toshio', 'Kitabayashi, Issay', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Yokoyama, Akihiko']","['Miyamoto R', 'Okuda H', 'Kanai A', 'Takahashi S', 'Kawamura T', 'Matsui H', 'Kitamura T', 'Kitabayashi I', 'Inaba T', 'Yokoyama A']",,"['Tsuruoka Metabolomics Laboratory, National Cancer Center, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-0052, Japan.', 'Tsuruoka Metabolomics Laboratory, National Cancer Center, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-0052, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Tsuruoka Metabolomics Laboratory, National Cancer Center, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-0052, Japan; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Isotope Science Center, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0032, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Therapy and Division of Stem Cell Signaling, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Tsuruoka Metabolomics Laboratory, National Cancer Center, Tsuruoka, Yamagata 997-0052, Japan; Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.

The mechanism of relapse post-CART therapy is under vigorous research. We report a 9-year-old boy who received CD19-CART therapy after BM ALL relapse post-HSCT. He presented with unilateral eye swelling which was initially managed as orbital cellulitis. Later on, it was proven to be an isolated ALL orbital relapse without peripheral blood B-cell detection or BM involvement. Despite radiotherapy, he subsequently developed refractory CD19 positive ALL BM relapse. This case highlights the possibility of unusual relapse sites after CART-therapy and that regular peripheral B-cell monitoring is not enough to assure remission status. Better monitoring tools are needed to detect early disease relapse. Further understanding of the pathophysiology of isolated extramedullary relapse post-CART therapy is warranted to improve the management of such challenging presentations.","['Essa, Mohammed F', 'Alsultan, Abdulrahman']","['Essa MF', 'Alsultan A']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4860-0796', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5577-3228']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Abdullah Specialist Children's Hospital, Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."", 'College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200930,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'CART-therapy', 'extramedullary', 'orbital']",2020/10/01 06:00,2020/10/01 06:00,['2020/09/30 17:13'],"['2020/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/30 17:13 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13852 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2021 Aug;25(5):e13852. doi: 10.1111/petr.13852.

In addition to cohesin, whether proteins that regulate cohesin's function have any direct role in hematopoiesis and hematologic diseases have not been fully examined. Separase, encoded by the ESPL1 gene, is an important regulator of cohesin's function. Canonically, protease activity of Separase resolves sister chromatid cohesion by cleaving cohesin subunit-Rad21 at the onset of anaphase. Using a Separase haploinsufficient mouse model, we have uncovered a novel role of Separase in hematopoiesis. We report that partial disruption of Separase distinctly alters the functional characteristics of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Although analyses of peripheral blood and bone marrow of Espl1(+/Hyp) mice broadly displayed unperturbed hematopoietic parameters during normal hematopoiesis, further probing of the composition of early hematopoietic cells in Espl1(+/Hyp) bone marrow revealed a mild reduction in the frequencies of the Lin(-) Sca1(+) Kit(-) (LSK) or LSK CD48(+) CD150(-) multipotent hematopoietic progenitors population without a significant change in either long-term or short-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) subsets at steady state. Surprisingly, however, we found that Separase haploinsufficiency promotes regeneration activity of HSCs in serial in vivo repopulation assays. In vitro colony formation assays also revealed an enhanced serial replating capacity of hematopoietic progenitors isolated from Espl1(+/Hyp) mice. Microarray analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that Separase haploinsufficiency in HSCs (SP-KSL) leads to enrichment of gene signatures that are upregulated in HSCs compared to committed progenitors and mature cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a key role of Separase in promoting hematopoietic regeneration of HSCs.","['Kumar, Praveen', 'Cheng, Haizi', 'Paudyal, Samridhdi', 'Nakamura, Lanelle V', 'Zhang, Nenggang', 'Li, Jessica T', 'Sasidharan, Rajkumar', 'Jeong, Mira', 'Pati, Debananda']","['Kumar P', 'Cheng H', 'Paudyal S', 'Nakamura LV', 'Zhang N', 'Li JT', 'Sasidharan R', 'Jeong M', 'Pati D']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2149-835X'],"['Texas Childrens Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Texas Childrens Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Texas Childrens Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Texas Childrens Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Texas Childrens Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Texas Childrens Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Solvuu, Inc, New York, New York, USA.', 'Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Texas Childrens Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200930,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ESPL1', 'Separase', 'cohesin', 'haploinsufficiency', 'hematopoiesis', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'mouse model']",2020/10/01 06:00,2020/10/01 06:00,['2020/09/30 17:13'],"['2019/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/30 17:13 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.3280 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Stem Cells. 2020 Sep 30. doi: 10.1002/stem.3280.,['(c) 2020 AlphaMed Press.'],"['RP160022/Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas', 'T32 Pediatric Hematology Research Training Program']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The median age was 59 years (20-80), 20 patients (71%) had ECOG 2-4 status, and 18 patients (64%) were stratified to European Leukemia Network 2017 adverse risk group. The most common mutations were ASXL1 (21%), RUNX1 (18%), FLT3 ITD/TKD (18%), PTPN11 (15%), NRAS/KRAS (15%), and WT1 (15%). Twenty-two patients (79%) received different post-venetoclax salvage therapies with the overall response rate of 23% (complete remission + morphological leukemia-free state). Three of six (50%) patients achieved complete remissions after therapy with venetoclax + actinomycin D +/- low-dose cytarabine. The remaining 6 patients did not receive any further salvage treatment mainly due to poor general condition. The median overall survival was 3.9 months for all patients (4.3 for those receiving post-venetoclax salvage vs 1.3 months receiving palliative care alone, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Though the remission rate and survival of patients failing venetoclax are poor, a small proportion of these R/R AML patients may still respond to cautious intensification of chemotherapy with venetoclax.","['Zucenka, Andrius', 'Pileckyte, Regina', 'Trociukas, Igoris', 'Peceliunas, Valdas', 'Vaitekenaite, Vilmante', 'Maneikis, Kazimieras', 'Davainis, Linas', 'Zvirblis, Tadas', 'Stoskus, Mindaugas', 'Gineikiene, Egle', 'Norvilas, Rimvydas', 'Dirse, Vaidas', 'Surauciute, Agne', 'Zucenkiene, Emile', 'Griskevicius, Laimonas']","['Zucenka A', 'Pileckyte R', 'Trociukas I', 'Peceliunas V', 'Vaitekenaite V', 'Maneikis K', 'Davainis L', 'Zvirblis T', 'Stoskus M', 'Gineikiene E', 'Norvilas R', 'Dirse V', 'Surauciute A', 'Zucenkiene E', 'Griskevicius L']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5520-1534', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4937-1924', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8949-3902']","['Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201027,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/etiology/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Failure', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],['acute myeloid leukemia'],2020/10/01 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/09/30 17:13'],"['2020/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/30 17:13 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13527 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2021 Jan;106(1):105-113. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13527.

It is difficult to evaluate progress in survival because of paucity of data in National Cancer Registry. In this study, we studied survival rates and trends in survival of the largest available cohort of children with cancer (n = 15 779, aged 0-18 years) from Egypt between 2007 and 2017, treated at Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt-(CCHE), representing 40% to 50% of all childhood cancers across Egypt. We estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) for 14 808 eligible patients using Kaplan-Meier method, and determined survival trends using Cox regression by single year of diagnosis and by diagnosis periods. We compared age-standardized rates to international benchmarks in England and the United States, identified cancers with inferior survival and provided recommendations for improvement. Five-year OS was 72.1% (95% CI 71.3-72.9) for all cancers combined, and survival trends increased significantly by single year of diagnosis (P < .001) and by calendar periods from 69.6% to 74.2% (P < .0001) between 2007-2012 and 2013-2017. Survival trends improved significantly for leukemias, lymphomas, CNS tumors, neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma and Ewing Sarcoma. Survival was significantly lower by 9% and 11.2% (P < .001) than England and the United States, respectively. Significantly inferior survival was observed for the majority of cancers. Although survival trends are improving for childhood cancers in Egypt/CCHE, survival is still inferior in high-income countries. We provide evidence-based recommendations to improve survival in Egypt by reflecting on current obstacles in care, with further implications on practice and policy.","['Soliman, Ranin M', 'Elhaddad,

Host factors interacting with p8 and mediating p8 transfer are unknown. Here, we report that vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), which promotes actin filament elongation, is a novel interaction partner of p8 and important for p8 and HTLV-1 Gag cell-to-cell transfer. VASP contains an Ena/VASP homology 1 (EVH1) domain that targets the protein to focal adhesions. Bioinformatics identified a short stretch in p8 (amino acids (aa) 24-45) which may mediate interactions with the EVH1 domain of VASP. Co-immunoprecipitations confirmed interactions of VASP:p8 in 293T, Jurkat and HTLV-1-infected MT-2 cells. Co-precipitation of VASP:p8 could be significantly blocked by peptides mimicking aa 26-37 of p8. Mutational studies revealed that the EVH1-domain of VASP is necessary, but not sufficient for the interaction with p8. Further, deletion of the VASP G- and F-actin binding domains significantly diminished co-precipitation of p8. Imaging identified areas of partial co-localization of VASP with p8 at the plasma membrane and in protrusive structures, which was confirmed by proximity ligation assays. Co-culture experiments revealed that p8 is transferred between Jurkat T-cells via VASP-containing conduits. Imaging and flow cytometry revealed that repression of both endogenous and overexpressed VASP by RNA interference or by CRISPR/Cas9 reduced p8 transfer to the cell surface and to target Jurkat T-cells. Stable repression of VASP by RNA interference in chronically infected MT-2 cells impaired both p8 and HTLV-1 Gag transfer to target Jurkat T-cells, while virus release was unaffected. Thus, we identified VASP as a novel interaction partner of p8, which is important for transfer of HTLV-1 p8 and Gag to target T-cells.","['Donhauser, Norbert', 'Socher, Eileen', 'Millen, Sebastian', 'Heym, Stefanie', 'Sticht, Heinrich', 'Thoma-Kress, Andrea K']","['Donhauser N', 'Socher E', 'Millen S', 'Heym S', 'Sticht H', 'Thoma-Kress AK']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2801-225X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6239-3749', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8182-4041', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5644-045X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8568-9526']","['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Division of Bioinformatics, Institute of Biochemistry, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Division of Bioinformatics, Institute of Biochemistry, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200930,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein)']",IM,"['*Cell Adhesion Molecules/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Focal Adhesions/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/virology', '*Gene Products, gag/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Microfilament Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Phosphoproteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Domains', '*T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/metabolism/virology']",PMC7526893,,,2020/10/01 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/09/30 17:12'],"['2020/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 17:12 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1008879 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-20-00804 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2020 Sep 30;16(9):e1008879. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008879. eCollection 2020 Sep.,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32997466,,Publisher,,,,,,2012,Rasburicase Therapy and G6PD and CYB5R Genotype,,,"Rasburicase (brand name Elitek) is a uric oxidase used to treat the high levels of uric acid that are associated with tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Tumor lysis syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by rapid break down of tumor cells during chemotherapy. Tumor lysis syndrome is associated with the treatment of aggressive lymphoma and leukemia, but it may also occur with other tumors including solid tumors. Massive cell breakdown results in the release of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid into the circulation. Urate crystals can precipitate in the kidneys, causing acute kidney damage. Prophylaxis and treatment of TLS involve aggressive intravenous (IV) hydration and the use of drugs to lower uric acid levels. Rasburicase breaks down uric acid to a more soluble metabolite (allantoin), which is then eliminated by the kidneys. A by-product of this reaction is hydrogen peroxide, an oxidizing agent. Red blood cells that lack the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) are sensitive to oxidative damage caused by agents like hydrogen peroxide due to a deficiency in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Once exposed, the red blood cells become rigid, trapped, and are rapidly broken down (hemolysis). This can lead to a deficiency of mature red blood cells (hemolytic anemia) and the production of red blood cells with abnormally high levels of methemoglobin (methemoglobinemia). Approximately 400 million people worldwide have G6PD deficiency. Most of these individuals are asymptomatic. However, they are at risk of life-threating hemolytic reactions and methemoglobinemia if given oxidizing drugs such as rasburicase. Rasburicase is contraindicated in individuals with G6PD deficiency. The FDA-approved drug label states that individuals at higher risk for G6PD deficiency should be screened before starting rasburicase therapy, for example, individuals of African or Mediterranean ancestry (Table 1) (1). Approximately 12% of African-Americans have G6PD deficiency. A rare cause of methemoglobinemia is a deficiency of antioxidant enzymes such as cytochrome b5 reductase 3 (CYB5R3). The drug label states it is not known whether individuals who have a deficiency of this enzyme, or another enzyme with antioxidant activity, are at increased risk of methemoglobinemia or hemolytic anemia during rasburicase therapy. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) has published dosing recommendations for rasburicase based on G6PD phenotype (Table 2). The CPIC states for individuals with normal G6PD phenotype, there is no reason to withhold rasburicase based on G6PD status. For individuals who are G6PD deficient, with or without hemolytic anemia, rasburicase is contraindicated. For individuals who have a variable G6PD phenotype, G6PD enzyme activity must be measured to ascertain that G6PD status is normal. For cases where rasburicase is contraindicated, alternative drugs include allopurinol (2).","['Dean, Laura', 'Kane, Megan']","['Dean L', 'Kane M']",,,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Bethesda (MD),,,,,,,,['NLM'],"['Rasburicase', 'rasburicase response', 'Elitek', 'G6PD', 'CYB5R3']",2020/10/01 06:01,2020/10/01 06:01,,,['NBK562585 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20201001,['20200929'],['National Center for Biotechnology Information (US)'],['Medical Genetics Summaries'],"['Pratt, Victoria M.', 'Scott, Stuart A.', 'Pirmohamed, Munir', 'Esquivel, Bernard', 'Kane, Megan S.', 'Kattman, Brandi L.', 'Malheiro, Adriana J.']","['Pratt VM', 'Scott SA', 'Pirmohamed M', 'Esquivel B', 'Kane MS', 'Kattman BL', 'Malheiro AJ']",['2020/10/01 06:01'],,

After preparing dimethoxy conduritol-B as a key compound, regiospecific bromination of the alkene moiety of dimethoxy conduritol-B and acid-catalyzed ring opening of dimethoxydiacetate conduritol-B epoxide with Ac2 O afforded the desired new chiro-inositol derivatives and scyllo-inositol derivative, respectively. Spectroscopic methods were employed for the characterization of all synthesized compounds. The novel inositols (11-17) had effective inhibition profiles against human carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes I and II (hCA I and II) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The novel inositols 11-17 were found to be effective inhibitors against AChE, hCA I, and hCA II enzymes. Ki values were calculated in the range of 87.59 +/- 7.011 to 237.95 +/- 17.75 muM for hCA I, 65.08 +/- 12.39 to 538.98 +/- 61.26 muM for hCA II, and 193.28 +/- 43.13 to 765.08 +/- 209.77 muM for AChE, respectively.

The aim of this pilot study is to determine the presence of premature ocular aging features in CCS, specifically childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors. Methods: This prospective case-control study was conducted over a period of 21 months, starting July 2015 till March 2017. A total of 59 childhood ALL survivors who attended the Paediatric Oncology Clinic of University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) and 48 age, race, and gender-matched controls went through a series of ocular examinations and tests. Inclusion criteria used to recruit survivors were age above 16 years, history of ALL in childhood, completion of treatment for ALL, and a remission period of at least 5 years. Patients with ocular disease and those who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were excluded. The parameters measured were visual acuity, amplitude of accommodation, pupil cycle time (PCT), and tear break-up time (TBUT). Results: Survivors of childhood ALL demonstrated significant differences in amplitude of accommodation, PCT, and TBUT compared to age-matched controls. Survivors had a lower median (interquartile range [IQR]) amplitude of accommodation compared to controls (11.0 D [9.0-13.0] vs. 12.0 D [10.5-15]; p = 0.045). Survivors also showed a longer median (IQR) PCT in comparison to controls (931.00 mseconds (857.00-1063.00) vs. 875.50 mseconds (825.75-966.00); p = 0.024). In addition, median (IQR) TBUT was worse in survivors in comparison to the control group (9 seconds [6-13] vs. 11 seconds [10-15]; p = 0.001). Conclusion: Survivors of childhood ALL demonstrate premature ocular aging features compared to age-matched controls. Thus, survivors may benefit from having ocular examinations as part of their routine late-effects screening to detect age-related ocular morbidities early in its course.","['Chandrasekaran, Sudhashini', 'Ramli, Norlina', 'Ahmad, Marium Jamaluddin', 'Effendi, Irina', 'Amir, Nurul Najieha', 'Chow, Rhuen Chiou', 'Chee, Caroline Ka Lin', 'Azanan, Mohamad Shafiq', 'Abd Ghafar, Sayyidatul Syahirah', 'Ariffin, Hany', 'Kamalden, Tengku Ain']","['Chandrasekaran S', 'Ramli N', 'Ahmad MJ', 'Effendi I', 'Amir NN', 'Chow RC', 'Chee CKL', 'Azanan MS', 'Abd Ghafar SS', 'Ariffin H', 'Kamalden TA']",,"['Department of Ophthalmology, UM Eye Research Centre, University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, UM Eye Research Centre, University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, UM Eye Research Centre, University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, UM Eye Research Centre, University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, UM Eye Research Centre, University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, UM Eye Research Centre, University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, UM Eye Research Centre, University Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200930,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aging', '*Aging, Premature', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Pilot Projects', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Survivors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors', '*childhood cancer survivors', '*ocular changes', '*premature ocular aging']",2020/10/01 06:00,2021/11/27 06:00,['2020/09/30 12:13'],"['2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/30 12:13 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2020.0064 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2021 Aug;10(4):425-431. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2020.0064.

The aim of the paper was to analyze immunoglobulin heavy variable chain (IGHV) rearrangement and IGHV usage in CLL cases associated with ionizing radiation (IR) exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples of 76 clean-up workers of Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident of 1986 (the main group) and 194 non-exposed patients (the control group) were analyzed. Two groups of CLL patients were comparable by gender (all patients were male), age, and place of residence (rural or urban). RESULTS: Some features of IR-associated CLL cases as compared to CLL cases in patients without history of IR exposure were revealed. Among unmutated IGHV sequences, IGHV1 genes were less commonly used (29.4% vs 48.6%; p = 0.018), while the frequency of IGHD6 genes was higher (23.5% vs 10%; p = 0.029). The unmutated IGHV sequences did not use IGHD3-16 gene (0% vs 7.9%, p = 0.038). Mutated IGHV sequences were less frequently expressed IGHV3 genes (44% vs 68.5%; p = 0.037) due low representation of IGHV3-21 (4% vs 11.1%) and IGHV3-23 (0% vs 11.1%) genes; did not use IGHD3-22 gene (0% vs 18.5%, p = 0.025); and have signs of positive selection in the HCDR regions (Sigma = 0.5029 +/- 0.155 vs -0.0539 +/- 0.14; p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: The revealed differences in IGHV gene usage and B-cell receptor structure in the main and the control groups of CLL patients indirectly indicate a change in the spectrum of antigens associated with CLL under IR exposure. The possible antigenic drivers associated with CLL associated with IR exposure are discussed.","['Abramenko, I V *', 'Bilous, N I', 'Chumak, A A', 'Dyagil, I S', 'Martina, Z V']","['Abramenko IV *', 'Bilous NI', 'Chumak AA', 'Dyagil IS', 'Martina ZV']",,"['National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.', 'National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv 02000, Ukraine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Russia/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,2020/10/01 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2020/09/30 11:03'],"['2020/09/30 11:03 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['14839 [pii]', '10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-42-no-3.14839 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2020 Sep;42(3):172-177. doi: 10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-42-no-3.14839.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, most initial therapies can induce remission while some patients then relapse and do not respond well to chemotherapy. The sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide (PTL) can induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines via inhibition of pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B and has anti-tumor activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment. AIM: To study the role of OPN in conferring in vitro resistance to PTL in Jurkat cells. METHODS: Jurkat cells were cultured with 8-20 mum PTL for 48 h. Transfection with OPN siRNA was provided. Apoptosis assays were performed with Annexin V-Alexa Fluor-488/PI. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure OPN gene expression using the 2-2(-DeltaDeltaCt) method. RESULTS: PTL has cytotoxic and apoptotic effect on Jurkat cells with IC50 values of 16.1 mum, and growth inhibition effect of PTL does not differ significantly in combination with OPN-siRNA. OPN gene expression is not affected by PTL. CONCLUSIONS: Parthenolide induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells, but inhibition of osteopontin gene expression with siRNA does not reduce apoptotic effect of parthenolide.","['Mehri, S', 'Mohammadi, S', 'Nikbakht, M', 'Sahmani, M', 'Zahedpanah, M *']","['Mehri S', 'Mohammadi S', 'Nikbakht M', 'Sahmani M', 'Zahedpanah M *']",,"['Qazvin University of Medical Sciences, Qazvin, 34197-59811, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 14155-6559, Iran.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 14155-6559, Iran.', 'Qazvin University of Medical Sciences, Qazvin, 34197-59811, Iran.', 'Qazvin University of Medical Sciences, Qazvin, 34197-59811, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Osteopontin/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology/toxicity']",,,,2020/10/01 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2020/09/30 11:03'],"['2020/09/30 11:03 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['15180 [pii]', '10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-42-no-3.15180 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2020 Sep;42(3):188-191. doi: 10.32471/exp-oncology.2312-8852.vol-42-no-3.15180.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study aimed to investigate how the opioid analgesic remifentanil treatment affects I/R-induced hepatic injury and explore the possible mechanisms related to HIF1alpha. Initially, an I/R-induced hepatic injury animal model was established in C57BL/6 mice, and an in vitro hypoxia-reoxygenation model was constructed in NCTC-1469 cells, followed by remifentanil treatment and HIF1alpha silencing treatment. The levels of blood glucose, lipids, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in mouse serum were measured using automatic chemistry analyser, while the viability and apoptosis of cells were detected using CCK8 assay and flow cytometry. Our results revealed that mice with I/R-induced hepatic injury showed higher serum levels of blood glucose, lipids, ALT and AST and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression, and lower HIF1alpha and ZEB1 expression (P < .05), which were reversed after remifentanil treatment (P < .05). Besides, HIF1alpha silencing increased the serum levels of blood glucose, lipids, ALT and AST (P < .05). Furthermore, hypoxia-induced NCTC-1469 cells exhibited decreased HIF1alpha and ZEB1 expression, reduced cell viability, as well as increased LIF expression and cell apoptosis (P < .05), which were reversed by remifentanil treatment (P < .05). Moreover, HIF1alpha silencing down-regulated ZEB1 expression, decreased cell viability, and increased cell apoptosis (P < .05). ZEB1 was identified to bind to the promoter region of LIF and inhibit its expression. In summary, remifentanil protects against hepatic I/R injury through HIF1alpha and downstream effectors.","['Zhou, Rongsheng', 'Li, Shuang', 'Mei, Xiaopeng', 'Jiang, Tao', 'Wang, Qiang']","['Zhou R', 'Li S', 'Mei X', 'Jiang T', 'Wang Q']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1135-3632'],"[""Department of Anesthesiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Anesthesiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Anesthesiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Anesthesiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Anesthesiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200930,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Analgesics, Opioid)', '0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hif1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (ZEB1 protein, human)', '0 (ZEB1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'P10582JYYK (Remifentanil)']",IM,"['Alanine Transaminase/metabolism', 'Analgesics, Opioid/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/metabolism', 'Blood Glucose/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Liver/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Remifentanil/*pharmacology', 'Reperfusion Injury/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1/*metabolism']",PMC7701522,['NOTNLM'],"['*HIF1alpha', '*LIF', '*ZEB1', '*hepatic ischaemia/reperfusion injury', '*remifentanil']",2020/10/01 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/09/30 08:45'],"['2020/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/30 08:45 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.15929 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2020 Nov;24(22):13196-13207. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.15929.

AML outcomes between resource-constrained and developed countries have not been compared directly. We analyzed two cohorts: from Sao Paulo state, Brazil (USP, n = 312) and Oxford, United Kingdom (OUH, n = 158). USP cohort had inferior 5-year overall survival compared with OUH (29% vs. 49%, adjusted-p=.027). USP patients have higher early-mortality (23% vs. 6% p<.001) primarily due to multi-resistant Gram-negative bacterial and fungal infections. USP had higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (60% vs. 50%, p=.0022), were less likely to undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) (28% vs. 75%, p<.001) and waited longer for HSCT (median, 23.8 vs. 7.2 months, p<.001). Three-year survival in relapsed patients was worse in USP than OUH (10% vs. 39%, p<.001). Our study indicates that efforts to improve AML outcomes in Brazil should focus on infection prevention and control, and access to HSCT.","['Silveira, Douglas R A', 'Coelho-Silva, Juan L', 'Silva,

Extensive epigenetic changes were found in this group of patients. In clinical study, we found miR-181a expression level was significantly lower in MLL-rearranged AML. As an important epi-miRNA, the role of miR-181a as an epigenetic regulator in leukemia has not been investigated before. In this study, we found miR-181a overexpression enhanced total protein acetylation in THP-1 cells, which harbor MLL-AF9 fusion gene, and protein Mass Spectrum identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) was a major downstream target. Increased PARP1 acetylation was mediated by down-regulation of histone deacetylase Sirtuin1 (Sirt1). MiR-181a overexpression resulted in DNA trapping of PARP1, increased DNA double strand break formation and increased chemosensitivity of leukemia cells both in vitro and in vivo. This study indicates miR-181a-Sirt1-PARP1 acetylation pathway could be a promising target for this special group of AML.","['Zhou, Di', 'Xu, Peipei', 'Zhou, Xuan', 'Diao, Zhenyu', 'Ouyang, Jian', 'Yan, Guijun', 'Chen, Bing']","['Zhou D', 'Xu P', 'Zhou X', 'Diao Z', 'Ouyang J', 'Yan G', 'Chen B']",,"[""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Reproductive Medicine, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Reproductive Medicine, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200930,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', '*MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', '*Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*PARP1', '*Sirt1', '*acetylation', '*miR-181a']",2020/10/01 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/09/30 08:41'],"['2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/30 08:41 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1824067 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2021 Jan;62(1):136-146. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1824067.

ATM is frequently altered in several human cancers. Recently, we and others have shown that loss of ATM is associated with defective mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) fibroblasts and B-cell lymphomas. Further, we reported that ATM protein but not ATM kinase activity is required for mitophagy. However, the mechanism of ATM kinase activation during ionophore-induced mitophagy is unknown. In the work reported here, using several ionophores in A-T and multiple T-cell and B-cell lymphoma cell lines, we show that ionophore-induced mitophagy triggers oxidative stress-induced ATM(Ser1981) phosphorylation through ROS activation, which is different from neocarzinostatin-induced activation of ATM(Ser1981), Smc1(Ser966), and Kap1(Ser824). We used A-T cells overexpressed with WT or S1981A (auto-phosphorylation dead) ATM plasmids and show that ATM is activated by ROS-induced oxidative stress emanating from ionophore-induced mitochondrial damage and mitophagy. The antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and glutathione significantly inhibited ROS production and ATM(Ser1981) phosphorylation but failed to inhibit mitophagy as determined by retroviral infection with mt-mKeima construct followed by lysosomal dual-excitation ratiometric pH measurements. Our data suggest that while ATM kinase does not participate in mitophagy, it is activated via elevated ROS.","['Sarkar, Aloke', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Sarkar A', 'Gandhi V']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6257-4200', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3172-9166']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Unit 1950, 1901 East Road, Houston, TX, 77054, USA. asarkar@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Unit 1950, 1901 East Road, Houston, TX, 77054, USA. vgandhi@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. vgandhi@mdanderson.org.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center UT Health Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, TX, USA. vgandhi@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200929,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Ionophores/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', '*Mitophagy', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphorylation', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology']",PMC7867566,['NOTNLM'],"['ATM kinase', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Mitophagy', 'ROS']",2020/10/01 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2020/09/30 06:18'],"['2020/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/30 06:18 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11010-020-03917-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11010-020-03917-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2021 Jan;476(1):417-423. doi: 10.1007/s11010-020-03917-1.

Our data indicate that plasma phage load is a promising marker for gut barrier damage and that gut phage translocation correlates with monocyte/macrophage activation and systemic inflammatory response in leukemic patients.","['Yin, Xue-Rui', 'Liu, Ping', 'Xu, Xi', 'Xia, Ying', 'Huang, Kai-Zhao', 'Wang, Qiong-Dan', 'Lai, Mei-Mei', 'Yu, Qi-Gui', 'Zheng, Xiao-Qun']","['Yin XR', 'Liu P', 'Xu X', 'Xia Y', 'Huang KZ', 'Wang QD', 'Lai MM', 'Yu QG', 'Zheng XQ']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9816-4833'],"[""The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China."", ""The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China."", ""Qilu Children's Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, 250000, China."", ""The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China."", ""The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China."", ""The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China."", ""The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China."", 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China.', ""The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China."", 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA.', ""The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China. jszhengxq@163.com."", 'School of Laboratory Medicine and Life Sciences, The Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education of China, Wenzhou Medical University, University Town, Room 327, Tongren Building, Chashan, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China. jszhengxq@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200929,Germany,Med Microbiol Immunol,Medical microbiology and immunology,0314524,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD14 protein, human)', '0 (CD163 antigen)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Bacterial)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology', '*Bacterial Translocation', 'Bacteriophages/*isolation & purification', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Female', '*Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*drug effects/microbiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/microbiology/virology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/blood', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Permeability', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/microbiology/virology', 'RNA, Bacterial/*blood', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/*blood', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/blood', 'Viremia/*diagnosis/etiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Gut phages translocation', 'Monocyte/macrophage activation', 'qPCR']",2020/10/01 06:00,2020/10/27 06:00,['2020/09/30 06:17'],"['2020/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/30 06:17 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00430-020-00694-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00430-020-00694-y [pii]']",ppublish,Med Microbiol Immunol. 2020 Dec;209(6):693-703. doi: 10.1007/s00430-020-00694-y.

Inhibition of CD47 restores the immune surveillance of AML cells. However, the inhibition of CD47 in AML by activated macrophages and the subsequent effects on different immune response parameters are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate the use of a distinct co-culture method to inhibit CD47 and therefore eliminate AML cells by macrophages in vitro. Human chemically induced THP-1 macrophages were activated using different concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and co-culturing with three AML cancer cell lines (HL-60, NB4, and THP-1), respectively, as well as normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). CD47 inhibition was observed in and selective to AML but not observed in normal PBMC. Additionally, calreticulin (CRT) levels were elevated in the same cell lines simultaneously, after co-culturing with activated human macrophages, but not elevated in normal cells. We also show that the activated macrophages secreted high levels of cytokines, including IL-12p70, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, consistent with the elimination of AML by macrophages. Our study reveals the potential of this model for screening new drugs against AML and the possibility of using human macrophages in AML treatment in the future.","['Hassan, Eman M', 'Walker, Gilbert C', 'Wang, Chen', 'Zou, Shan']","['Hassan EM', 'Walker GC', 'Wang C', 'Zou S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2480-6821'],"['Metrology Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, 100 Sussex Drive, Ottawa, ON, K1A 0R6, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Metrology Research Centre, National Research Council Canada, 100 Sussex Drive, Ottawa, ON, K1A 0R6, Canada.

Methods: Thirty-five patients with advanced MF were treated with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allo-HCT. We searched for matched sibling donors first, followed by matched or mismatched unrelated donors and familial mismatched donors. Preconditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (total 150 mg/m(2)) and busulfan (total 6.4 mg/kg) with total body irradiation 400cGy. Results: All showed engraftments, but four showed either leukemic relapse or delayed graft failure. Two-year overall survival (OS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 60.0% and 29.9%, respectively. Acute GVHD was observed in 19 patients, and grade III-IV acute GVHD (eight grade III and four grade IV) was higher in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched donor HCT compared with HLA-matched HCT (70% versus 20%). Chronic GVHD was observed in 16 patients, and a cumulative incidence of severe chronic GVHD was 33% in HLA-mismatched donor HCT and 7.7% in HLA-matched HCT. Significant hepatic GVHD was observed in nine patients (five acute, four chronic) and six of them died. Multivariate analysis revealed inferior OS in HLA-mismatched donor HCT (hazard ratio (HR) = 6.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-25.7, p = 0.009) and in patients with high ferritin level at the time of pre-conditioning period (HR = 7.22, 95% CI 1.9-27.5, p = 0.004), which were related to higher incidence of hepatic GVHD with high NRM rate. Conclusion: RIC allo-HCT can be a valid choice providing graft-versus-fibrosis effect for advanced MF patients. However, HLA-mismatched donor and high pre-HCT ferritin level related to fatal hepatic GVHD should be regarded as poor-risk parameters.","['Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Min, Gi June', 'Park, Sung-Soo', 'Park, Silvia', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Lee, Jong Wook', 'Eom, Ki-Seong']","['Yoon JH', 'Min GJ', 'Park SS', 'Park S', 'Lee SE', 'Cho BS', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Kim HJ', 'Min CK', 'Cho SG', 'Lee JW', 'Eom KS']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2145-9131', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2949-4166']","[""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital and Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222, Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200918,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,PMC7502801,['NOTNLM'],"['allogeneic', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'myelofibrosis', 'reduced intensity conditioning']",2020/10/01 06:00,2020/10/01 06:01,['2020/09/30 06:13'],"['2020/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 06:13 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620720936935 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620720936935 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2020 Sep 18;11:2040620720936935. doi: 10.1177/2040620720936935. eCollection 2020.,"['(c) The Author(s), 2020.']",,"['Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that there is no conflict of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detailed characterization of such contaminations is therefore crucial to avoid misinterpretation and ensure robustness and reproducibility of research. Here we use DNA-seq data produced in our lab to first confirm that the Hep2 (clone 2B) cell line (Sigma-Aldrich catalog number: 85011412-1VL) is indistinguishable from the HeLa cell line by mapping integrations of the human papillomavirus 18 (HPV18) at their expected loci on chromosome 8. We then show that the cell line is also contaminated by a xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMLV) that is nearly identical to the mouse Bxv1 provirus and we characterize one Bxv1 provirus, located in the second intron of the pseudouridylate synthase 1 (PUS1) gene. Using an RNA-seq dataset, we confirm the high expression of the E6 and E7 HPV18 oncogenes, show that the entire Bxv1 genome is moderately expressed, and retrieve a Bxv1 splicing event favouring expression of the env gene. Hep2 (clone 2B) is the fourth human cell line so far known to be contaminated by the Bxv1 XMLV.

Thus, CXCR4 represents a promising drug target and several CXCR4 antagonizing agents are in preclinical or clinical development. Important parameters in drug lead evaluation are determination of binding affinities to the receptor and assessment of their stability and activity in plasma or blood of animals and humans. Here, we designed a microtiter plate-based CXCR4 antibody competition assay that enables to measure inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) and affinity constants (Ki values) of CXCR4 targeting drugs. The assay is based on the observation that most if not all CXCR4 antagonists compete with binding of the fluorescence-tagged CXCR4 antibody 12G5 to the receptor. We demonstrate that this antibody-competition assay allows a convenient and cheap determination of binding affinities of various CXCR4 antagonists in living cells within just 3 h. Moreover, the assay can be performed in the presence of high concentrations of physiologically relevant body fluids, and thus is a useful readout to evaluate stability (i.e. half-life) of CXCR4 ligands in serum/plasma, and even whole human and mouse blood ex vivo. Thus, this optimized 12G5 antibody-competition assay allows a robust and convenient determination and calculation of various important pharmacological parameters of CXCR4 receptor-drug interaction and may not only foster future drug development but also animal welfare by reducing the number of experimental animals.","['Harms, Mirja', 'Gilg, Andrea', 'Standker, Ludger', 'Beer, Ambros J', 'Mayer, Benjamin', 'Rasche, Volker', 'Gruber, Christian W', 'Munch, Jan']","['Harms M', 'Gilg A', 'Standker L', 'Beer AJ', 'Mayer B', 'Rasche V', 'Gruber CW', 'Munch J']",,"['Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Core Facility Functional Peptidomics, Ulm University Medical Center, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Epidemiology and Medical Biochemistry, Ulm University, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Experimental Cardiovascular Imaging (ExCaVI), Ulm University Medical Center, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology, Center for Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, 89081, Ulm, Germany. jan.muench@uni-ulm.de.', 'Core Facility Functional Peptidomics, Ulm University Medical Center, 89081, Ulm, Germany. jan.muench@uni-ulm.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200929,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity/immunology', 'Female', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Plasma/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC7525492,,,2020/10/01 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2020/09/30 06:08'],"['2020/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 06:08 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-73012-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-73012-4 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Sep 29;10(1):16036. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-73012-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, transformation to other aggressive lymphomas as plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) does occur. PBL is an extremely aggressive lymphoma and is usually treated using a CHOP-like regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone/dexamethasone), but with poor outcome. The only curative treatment is allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT).We report on a case of CLL treated with ibrutinib that underwent transformation to PBL. Due to high expression of CD138, we added daratumumab to the chemotherapy with a good, but transitory response. The case did not make it to an ASCT.

The mammalian DNMT family includes three major members that have functional methylation activities, termed DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. DNMT3A and DNMT3B are responsible for methylation establishment, whereas DNMT1 maintains methylation during DNA replication. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that regulation of DNA methylation by DNMTs is critical for normal hematopoiesis. Aberrant DNA methylation due to DNMT dysregulation and mutations is known as an important molecular event of hematological malignancies, such as DNMT3A mutations in acute myeloid leukemia. In this review, we first describe the basic methylation mechanisms of DNMTs and their functions in lymphocyte maturation and differentiation. We then discuss the current understanding of DNA methylation heterogeneity in leukemia and lymphoma to highlight the importance of studying DNA methylation targets. We also discuss DNMT mutations and pathogenic roles in human leukemia and lymphoma. We summarize the recent understanding of how DNMTs interact with transcription factors or cofactors to repress the expression of tumor suppressor genes. Finally, we highlight current clinical studies using DNMT inhibitors for the treatment of these hematological malignancies.","['Hoang, Nguyet-Minh', 'Rui, Lixin']","['Hoang NM', 'Rui L']",,"['Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, 53792, USA; Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, 53792, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, 53792, USA; Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, 53792, USA.

The primary objective of this phase I single center open label study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the dual pan-class I PI3K and mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 in patients with advanced leukemia. METHODS: Herein patients > 18 years of age who had relapsed or showed refractory leukemia were treated with BEZ235 (orally at 300-400 mg BID (cohort - 1/1)) to assess safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetic (PK). Adverse events data and serious adverse events were analyzed and haematological and clinical biochemistry toxicities were assessed from laboratory test parameters. Response was assessed for the first time at the end of cycle 1 (day 29) and after every subsequent cycle. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses of BEZ235 were also included (BEZ235 plasma levels, phosphorylation of AKT, S6 and 4EBP1). On statistics this trial is a multiple ascending dose study in which a following variant of the 3 + 3 rule (""Rolling Six""), a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 12 patients was recruited for the dose escalation and another 5 were planned for the expansion phase. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with ALL (n = 11) or AML (n = 12) or CML-BP (n = 1) were enrolled. All patients had failed one (n = 5) or more lines of therapy (n = 5) and 14 patients were in refractory / refractory relapse. No formal MTD was defined, stomatitis and gastrointestinal toxicity at 400 mg BID dose was considered incompatible with prolonged treatment. The RP2D of BEZ235 was defined as 300 mg BID. Four of 24 patients showed clinical benefit. Twenty-two of 24 patients discontinued because of progression, (median time to progression 27 days (4d-112d). There was no association between PK parameters and efficacy or tolerability. CONCLUSIONS: Combined inhibition of PI3K and mTOR inhibits a clinically meaningful driver pathway in a small subset of patients with ALL, with no benefit in patients with AML.

Leukemia relapse is due to residual quiescent leukemia cells that escape conventional therapies and later reemerge. Eliminating not only growing but quiescent leukemia cells is critical to effectively treating leukemia and preventing its recurrence. Such dual targeting therapeutic agents, however, are lacking in the clinic. To start tackling this problem, encouraged by the promising anticancer effects of a set of curcumin derivatives in our earlier studies, we examined in this work the effects of a 4-arylmethyl curcumin derivative (C212) in eliminating both growing and quiescent leukemia cells. METHODS: We analyzed the effects of C212 on the growth and viability of growing and quiescent leukemia cells using MTS, apoptosis, cell cycle and cell tracking assays. The effects of C212 on the quiescence depth of leukemia cells were measured using EdU incorporation assay upon growth stimulation. The mechanisms of C212-induced apoptosis and deep dormancy, particularly associated with its inhibition of Hsp90 activity, were studied using molecular docking, protein aggregation assay, and Western blot of client proteins. RESULTS: C212, on the one hand, inhibits growing leukemia cells at a higher efficacy than curcumin by inducing apoptosis and G2/M accumulation; it, on the other hand, eliminates quiescent leukemia cells that are resistant to conventional treatments. Furthermore, C212 drives leukemia cells into and kills them at deep quiescence. Lastly, we show that C212 induces apoptosis and drives cells into deep dormancy at least partially by binding to and inhibiting Hsp90, leading to client protein degradation and protein aggregation. CONCLUSION: C212 effectively eliminates both growing and quiescent leukemia cells by inhibiting Hsp90. The property of C212 to kill quiescent leukemia cells in deep dormancy avoids the risk associated with awaking therapy-resistant subpopulation of quiescent leukemia cells during treatments, which may lead to the development of novel therapies against leukemia relapse.

Several studies showed that the GTT was effective. However, there were only a few localized trigger tools that had been established to detect pediatric adverse drug events (ADEs) in China. This study aimed to establish a pediatric trigger tool based on GTT, to examine the performance by detecting pediatric inpatients ADEs in a Chinese hospital (a retrospective review), and to investigate the factors associating with the occurrence of ADEs. METHODS: The triggers were established by three steps including literature search, triggers extraction and revision, and experts investigation. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to detect ADEs by using 200 pediatric inpatient records of Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital. RESULTS: Thirty-three preliminary triggers were established, and 2 rounds of experts investigation were conducted. Finally, 33 triggers were established. In the retrospective review, the positive trigger rate was 64.0%, while the positive predictive value (PPV) was 24.9%. The occurrence of inpatients with ADEs was 20.5%. ADEs/100 admissions were 49.0. ADEs/1000 patient days were 46.89. The most common ADE categories were leukocyte disorders, skin disorders and platelet disorders. The severity of 39 ADEs was grade 1, 55 ADEs was grade 2, 4 ADEs was grade 3. The highest frequency of ADE-related drugs was antineoplastic, followed by antibacterial. The length of stay and the leukemia in the diagnosed diseases were positively correlated with ADEs. CONCLUSIONS: The 33 pediatric triggers may detect ADEs effectively, but still need to be optimized. This study may provide some references for further research in order to improve the rationality and safety of medication.","['Liu, Yi', 'Yan, Junfeng', 'Xie, Yunfei', 'Bian, Yuan']","['Liu Y', 'Yan J', 'Xie Y', 'Bian Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8729-8713', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7831-8196', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2365-9177']","['Clinical Medical College & Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University, Chengdu, China.', ""Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China."", ""Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China."", ""Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China. bianyuan567@126.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200929,England,BMC Pediatr,BMC pediatrics,100967804,,IM,"['Child', 'China/epidemiology', '*Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC7523329,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adverse drug events', '*Drug toxicity', '*Pediatric', '*Trigger points', '*Triggers']",2020/10/01 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/30 05:46'],"['2020/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 05:46 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12887-020-02354-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12887-020-02354-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Pediatr. 2020 Sep 29;20(1):454. doi: 10.1186/s12887-020-02354-9.,,"['16PJ484/Health and Family Planning Commission of Sichuan/International', 'S16070/Sichuan Medical Association/International', '2018LY09/Clinical Research and Transformation Project of Sichuan provincial', ""People's Hospital/International""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NUP98-NSD1-positive AML often carries additional mutations in genes including FLT3, NRAS, WT1, and MYC. The purpose of our study was to characterize the cooperative potential of the fusion and its associated Neuroblastoma rat sarcoma (NRAS) mutation. By constitutively expressing NUP98-NSD1 and NRASG12D in a syngeneic mouse model and using a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model from a NUP98-NSD1-positive AML patient, we evaluated the functional role of these genes and tested a novel siRNA formulation that inhibits the oncogenic driver NUP98-NSD1. NUP98-NSD1 transformed murine bone marrow (BM) cells in vitro and induced AML in vivo. While NRASG12D expression was insufficient to transform cells alone, co-expression of NUP98-NSD1 and NRASG12D enhanced the leukemogenicity of NUP98-NSD1. We developed a NUP98-NSD1-targeting siRNA/lipid nanoparticle formulation that significantly prolonged the survival of the PDX mice. Our study demonstrates that mutated NRAS cooperates with NUP98-NSD1 and shows that direct targeting of the fusion can be exploited as a novel treatment strategy in NUP98-NSD1-positive AML patients.","['Mohanty, Sagarajit', 'Jyotsana, Nidhi', 'Sharma, Amit', 'Kloos, Arnold', 'Gabdoulline, Razif', 'Othman, Basem', 'Lai, Courteney K', 'Schottmann, Renate', 'Mandhania, Madhvi', 'Schmoellerl, Johannes', 'Grebien, Florian', 'Ramsay, Euan', 'Thomas, Anitha', 'Vornlocher, Hans-Peter', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Heuser, Michael']","['Mohanty S', 'Jyotsana N', 'Sharma A', 'Kloos A', 'Gabdoulline R', 'Othman B', 'Lai CK', 'Schottmann R', 'Mandhania M', 'Schmoellerl J', 'Grebien F', 'Ramsay E', 'Thomas A', 'Vornlocher HP', 'Ganser A', 'Thol F', 'Heuser M']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2090-2856', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4289-2281', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5318-9044']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37235, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'National Centre for Cell Science, Pune 411007, India.', 'Institute for Medical Biochemistry, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, 1210 Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute for Medical Biochemistry, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, 1210 Vienna, Austria.', 'Precision NanoSystems Inc., Vancouver, BC V6P 6T7, Canada.', 'Precision NanoSystems Inc., Vancouver, BC V6P 6T7, Canada.', 'AxolabsGmbH, 95326 Kulmbach, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200926,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7600396,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'NRASG12D', 'NUP98-NSD1', 'liposome', 'siRNA']",2020/10/01 06:00,2020/10/01 06:01,['2020/09/30 01:02'],"['2020/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12102766 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12102766 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Sep 26;12(10). pii: cancers12102766. doi: 10.3390/cancers12102766.,,"['638035/ERC_/European Research Council/International', '70112697/Deutsche Krebshilfe', 'HE 5240/5-1,HE 5240/5-2,HE 5240/6-1,HE 5240/6-2/DFG grants']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we investigated whether supplementing in vitro maturation medium with Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) prior to vitrification affects embryo development and gene expression at different embryo developmental stages. A panel of genes including maternal effect, epigenetics, apoptosis and heat stress was relatively quantified. The results show reduced cleavage rates after vitrification, regardless of the LIF treatment. Although not statistically different from control-vitrified oocytes, oocyte apoptosis and the blastocyst yield of LIF-vitrified oocytes were similar to their non-vitrified counterparts. Vitrification increased oocyte ZAR1, NPM2 and DPPA3 gene expression while its expression decreased in LIF-vitrified oocytes to similar or close levels to those of non-vitrified oocytes. With a few gene-specific exceptions, vitrification significantly increased the expression of DNMT3A, HDAC1, KAT2A, BAX and BCL2L1 in oocytes and most stages of embryo development, while comparable expression patterns for these genes were observed between LIF-vitrified and non-vitrified groups. Vitrification increased HSPA1A expression in oocytes and HSP90AA1 in 2-cell embryos. Our data suggest that vitrification triggers stage-specific changes in gene expression throughout embryonic development. However, the inclusion of LIF in the IVM medium prior to vitrification stimulates blastocyst development and several other developmental parameters and induces oocytes and embryos to demonstrate gene expression patterns similar to those derived from non-vitrified oocytes.","['Vendrell-Flotats, Meritxell', 'Garcia-Martinez, Tania', 'Martinez-Rodero, Iris', 'Lopez-Bejar, Manel', 'LaMarre, Jonathan', 'Yeste, Marc', 'Mogas, Teresa']","['Vendrell-Flotats M', 'Garcia-Martinez T', 'Martinez-Rodero I', 'Lopez-Bejar M', 'LaMarre J', 'Yeste M', 'Mogas T']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6360-9337', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7057-2045', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9490-6126', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3956-3041', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2209-340X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6733-1328']","['Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, Autonomous University of Barcelona, ES-08193 Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'Department of Animal Health and Anatomy, Autonomous University of Barcelona, ES-08193 Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, Autonomous University of Barcelona, ES-08193 Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, Autonomous University of Barcelona, ES-08193 Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'Department of Animal Health and Anatomy, Autonomous University of Barcelona, ES-08193 Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, CA 91766, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, Institute of Food and Agricultural Technology, University of Girona, ES-17004 Girona, Spain.', 'Department of Animal Medicine and Surgery, Autonomous University of Barcelona, ES-08193 Cerdanyola del Valles, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200925,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cryopreservation', 'Culture Media/*pharmacology', 'Embryonic Development/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Oocyte Maturation Techniques', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Oocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Vitrification/*drug effects']",PMC7582665,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'cell count', 'cow', 'cryopreservation', 'cytokine', 'epigenetics', 'heat shock protein', 'inner cell mass', 'interleukin', 'maternal effect gene', 'maternal-embryonic transition', 'oocyte']",2020/10/01 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2020/09/30 01:02'],"['2020/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21197067 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21197067 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Sep 25;21(19). pii: ijms21197067. doi: 10.3390/ijms21197067.,,"['AGL2016-79802-P/Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion', '2017 SGR 1229/Generalitat de Catalunya', 'BES-2014-071075/Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion', '0/Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada', '0/OECD Co-operative Research Programme: Biological Resource Management for', 'Sustainable Agricultural Systems.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, marked ethnic disparities are found in the treatment of childhood ALL with less effective results and higher mortality rates being obtained in populations with a high level of Native American ancestry. Genetic variations of the patient can affect resistance to ALL chemotherapy and potentially play an important role in this disparity. In the present study, we investigated the association of 16 genetic polymorphisms with the cell and metabolic pathways of the chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of ALL with the risk of death in treating childhood ALL in patients with a high contribution of Amerindian ancestry, coming from the Brazilian Amazon. The study included 121 patients with B-cell ALL treated with the BFM-2002 protocol. We are the first to identify the association between the TPMT gene rs1142345 polymorphism and the high risk of death in treating childhood ALL. Patients with the CC genotype had an approximately 25.5 times higher risk of dying during treatment of the disease than patients with other genotypes (p = 0.019). These results may help elucidate how the patient's genetic characteristics contribute to the mortality disparity in populations with a high contribution of Native American ancestry. The rs1142345 variant of the TPMT gene could be used as a potential marker to early stratify patients at high risk of death in treating childhood ALL in the investigated population.","['Cardoso de Carvalho, Darlen', 'Pereira Colares Leitao, Luciana', 'Mello Junior, Fernando Augusto Rodrigues', 'Vieira Wanderley, Alayde', 'Souza, Tatiane Piedade de', 'Borges Andrade de Sa, Roberta', 'Cohen-Paes, Amanda', 'Rodrigues Fernandes, Marianne', 'Santos, Sidney', 'Salim Khayat, Andre', 'Pimentel de Assumpcao, Paulo', 'Pereira Carneiro Dos Santos, Ney']","['Cardoso de Carvalho D', 'Pereira Colares Leitao L', 'Mello Junior FAR', 'Vieira Wanderley A', 'Souza TP', 'Borges Andrade de Sa R', 'Cohen-Paes A', 'Rodrigues Fernandes M', 'Santos S', 'Salim Khayat A', 'Pimentel de Assumpcao P', 'Pereira Carneiro Dos Santos N']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2716-860X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1396-3442']","['Oncology Research Nucleus, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66063-023, Brazil.', 'Oncology Research Nucleus, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66063-023, Brazil.', 'Oncology Research Nucleus, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66063-023, Brazil.', 'Oncology Research Nucleus, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66063-023, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Pediatria, Ophir Loyola Hospital, Belem 66063-240, Brazil.', 'Human and Medical Genetics Laboratory, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66075-110, Brazil.', 'Oncology Research Nucleus, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66063-023, Brazil.', 'Oncology Research Nucleus, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66063-023, Brazil.', 'Oncology Research Nucleus, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66063-023, Brazil.', 'Oncology Research Nucleus, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66063-023, Brazil.', 'Human and Medical Genetics Laboratory, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66075-110, Brazil.', 'Oncology Research Nucleus, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66063-023, Brazil.', 'Oncology Research Nucleus, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66063-023, Brazil.', 'Joao de Barros Barreto University Hospital, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66063-023, Brazil.', 'Oncology Research Nucleus, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66063-023, Brazil.', 'Human and Medical Genetics Laboratory, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal do Para, Belem 66075-110, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200925,Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (TPMT protein, human)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",PMC7601477,['NOTNLM'],"['*Amazon', '*TPMT', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*admixed populations', '*ancestry', '*mortality', '*pediatrics', '*pharmacogenetics', '*polymorphism']",2020/10/01 06:00,2021/07/17 06:00,['2020/09/30 01:02'],"['2020/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/17 06:00 [medline]']","['genes11101132 [pii]', '10.3390/genes11101132 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2020 Sep 25;11(10). pii: genes11101132. doi: 10.3390/genes11101132.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 is the etiologic agent of the highly aggressive and currently incurable cancer adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and a neurological disease HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM)/tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP). BLV causes neoplastic proliferation of B cells in cattle: enzootic bovine leucosis (EBL). Despite the severity of these conditions, infection by HTLV-1 and BLV appear in most cases clinically asymptomatic. These viruses can undergo latency in their hosts. The silencing of proviral gene expression and maintenance of latency are central for the establishment of persistent infection, as well as for pathogenesis in vivo. In this review, we will present the mechanisms that control proviral activation and retroviral latency in deltaretroviruses, in comparison with other exogenous retroviruses. The 5' long terminal repeats (5'-LTRs) play a main role in controlling viral gene expression. While the regulation of transcription initiation is a major mechanism of silencing, we discuss topics that include (i) the epigenetic control of the provirus, (ii) the cis-elements present in the LTR, (iii) enhancers with cell-type specific regulatory functions, (iv) the role of virally-encoded transactivator proteins, (v) the role of repressors in transcription and silencing, (vi) the effect of hormonal signaling, (vii) implications of LTR variability on transcription and latency, and (viii) the regulatory role of non-coding RNAs. Finally, we discuss how a better understanding of these mechanisms may allow for the development of more effective treatments against Deltaretroviruses.","['Pluta, Aneta', 'Jaworski, Juan P', 'Douville, Renee N']","['Pluta A', 'Jaworski JP', 'Douville RN']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6860-4474', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1311-060X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7854-007X']","['Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, 24-100 Pulawy, Poland.', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas (CONICET), Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA), Instituto de Virologia, Nicolas Repetto y De los Reseros (s/n), CP1686 Hurlingham, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Department of Biology, The University of Winnipeg, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3E 0T5, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200925,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,"['0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/physiology', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Untranslated/metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Latency/*genetics']",PMC7601775,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bovine leukemia virus (BLV)', '*Deltaretrovirus', '*Human T-lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)', '*Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)', '*Retrovirus', '*latency', '*long terminal repeat (LTR)', '*transcription', '*viral gene regulation']",2020/10/01 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/09/30 01:02'],"['2020/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['v12101079 [pii]', '10.3390/v12101079 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2020 Sep 25;12(10). pii: v12101079. doi: 10.3390/v12101079.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we have studied global gene expression patterns in mouse embryonic skin derived from Pml depleted and wild type mouse embryos. Differential gene expression analysis at different developmental stages revealed a key role of PML in regulating genes involved in epidermal stratification. In particular, we observed dysregulation of the late cornified envelope gene cluster, which is a sub-region of the epidermal differentiation complex.

To date, no screening of circulating miRNAs has been carried out in the bone marrow compartment of AML. Accordingly, we investigated the circulating miRNA profile in AML bone marrow at diagnosis (AMLD) and first complete remission post treatment (AMLPT) in comparison to healthy donors (HD). METHODS: Circulating miRNAs were isolated from AML bone marrow aspirations, and a low-density TaqMan miRNA array was performed to identify deregulated miRNAs followed by quantitative RT-PCR to validate the results. Bioinformatic analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of the highly and significantly identified deregulated miRNA(s) as potential candidate biomarker(s). RESULTS: We found several deregulated miRNAs between the AMLD vs. HD vs. AMLPT groups, which were involved in tumor progression and immune suppression pathways. We also identified significant diagnostic and prognostic signatures with the ability to predict AML patient treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a possible role of enriched circulating bone marrow miRNAs in the initiation and progression of AML and highlights new markers for prognosis and treatment monitoring.","['Moussa Agha, Douaa', 'Rouas, Redouane', 'Najar, Mehdi', 'Bouhtit, Fatima', 'Naamane, Najib', 'Fayyad-Kazan, Hussein', 'Bron, Dominique', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'Lewalle, Philippe', 'Merimi, Makram']","['Moussa Agha D', 'Rouas R', 'Najar M', 'Bouhtit F', 'Naamane N', 'Fayyad-Kazan H', 'Bron D', 'Meuleman N', 'Lewalle P', 'Merimi M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9740-9122', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3465-4630', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1634-1104']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Haematology, Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 1000 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Haematology, Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 1000 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Osteoarthritis Research Unit, University of Montreal Hospital Research Center (CRCHUM), Department of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC H2X 0A9, Canada.', 'Genetics and Immune Cell Therapy Unit, Faculty of Sciences, University Mohammed Premier, Oujda 60000, Morocco.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Haematology, Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 1000 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Genetics and Immune Cell Therapy Unit, Faculty of Sciences, University Mohammed Premier, Oujda 60000, Morocco.', 'Translational and Clinical Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, UK.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Haematology, Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 1000 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Haematology, Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 1000 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 1070 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Haematology, Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 1000 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Haematology, Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 1000 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Genetics and Immune Cell Therapy Unit, Faculty of Sciences, University Mohammed Premier, Oujda 60000, Morocco.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200925,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Circulating MicroRNA)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Circulating MicroRNA/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC7583041,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'biomarkers', 'bone marrow', 'circulating microRNAs', 'immune regulation', 'oncogene', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor suppressor']",2020/10/01 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2020/09/30 01:01'],"['2020/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21197065 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21197065 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Sep 25;21(19). pii: ijms21197065. doi: 10.3390/ijms21197065.,,"[""na/Les Amis de l'Institut Bordet"", 'na/FNRS', 'na/Televie']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this population-based study was to evaluate the rate, risk factors, and long-term sequelae of VTE in children treated for ALL. The cohort included 1191 children aged 1-19 years diagnosed with ALL between 2003-2018, prospectively enrolled in two consecutive protocols: ALL-IC BFM 2002 and AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009. VTEs occurred in 89 patients (7.5%). Long-term sequelae were uncommon. By univariate analysis, we identified four significant risk factors for VTEs: Severe hypertriglyceridemia (p = 0.005), inherited thrombophilia (p < 0.001), age >10 years (p = 0.015), and high-risk ALL group (p = 0.039). In addition, the incidence of VTE was significantly higher in patients enrolled in AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 than in those enrolled in ALL-IC BFM 2002 (p = 0.001). Severe VTE occurred in 24 children (2%), all of whom had at least one risk factor. Elevated triglyceride levels at diagnosis did not predict hypertriglyceridemia during therapy. In a multivariate analysis of 388 children, severe hypertriglyceridemia and inherited thrombophilia were independent risk factors for VTE. Routine evaluation for these risk factors in children treated for ALL may help identify candidates for intervention.","['Barzilai-Birenboim, Shlomit', 'Nirel, Ronit', 'Arad-Cohen, Nira', 'Avrahami, Galia', 'Ben Harush, Miri', 'Barg, Assaf Arie', 'Bielorai, Bella', 'Elhasid, Ronit', 'Gilad, Gil', 'Toren, Amos', 'Weinreb, Sigal', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Elitzur, Sarah']","['Barzilai-Birenboim S', 'Nirel R', 'Arad-Cohen N', 'Avrahami G', 'Ben Harush M', 'Barg AA', 'Bielorai B', 'Elhasid R', 'Gilad G', 'Toren A', 'Weinreb S', 'Izraeli S', 'Elitzur S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6938-2540'],"[""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva 49202, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.', 'Department of Statistics and Data Science, Hebrew University, Jerusalem 9190501, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Ruth Rappaport Children's Hospital, Rambam Health Care Campus, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 3109601, Israel."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva 49202, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Soroka Medical Center, Ben Gurion University, Beer Sheva 84990, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan 52620, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan 52620, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv 6423906, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva 49202, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan 52620, Israel."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem 9112102, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva 49202, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva 49202, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 6997801, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200925,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7600511,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'hypertriglyceridemia', 'risk factors', 'sinus vein thrombosis', 'thrombophilia', 'venous thromboembolism']",2020/10/01 06:00,2020/10/01 06:01,['2020/09/30 01:01'],"['2020/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12102759 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12102759 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Sep 25;12(10). pii: cancers12102759. doi: 10.3390/cancers12102759.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The advent of oral, selective inhibitors of the B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) apoptosis pathway, such as venetoclax, will likely induce a paradigm shift in the treatment of AML. However, the high cost of this treatment and the risk of additive toxicity when used in combination with standard chemotherapy represent limitations to its use and underscore the need to identify which patients are most-and least-likely to benefit from incorporation of venetoclax into the treatment regimen. Bone marrow specimens from 93 newly diagnosed AML patients were collected in this study and evaluated for BCL-2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Using this low-cost, easily, and readily applicable analysis method, we found that 1 in 5 AML patients can be considered as BCL-2(-). In addition to a lower bone marrow blast percentage, this group exhibited a favorable molecular profile characterized by lower WT1 expression and underrepresentation of FLT3 mutations. As compared to their BCL-2(+) counterparts, the absence of BCL-2 expression was associated with a favorable response to standard chemotherapy and overall survival, thus potentially precluding the necessity for venetoclax add-on.","['Haes, Inke De', 'Dendooven, Amelie', 'Mercier, Marie Le', 'Puylaert, Pauline', 'Vermeulen, Katrien', 'Kockx, Mark', 'Deiteren, Kathleen', 'Maes, Marie-Berthe', 'Berneman, Zwi', 'Anguille, Sebastien']","['Haes I', 'Dendooven A', 'Mercier ML', 'Puylaert P', 'Vermeulen K', 'Kockx M', 'Deiteren K', 'Maes MB', 'Berneman Z', 'Anguille S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9900-7952', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1951-6715']","['Division of Hematology, Antwerp University Hospital, 2650 Edegem, Belgium.', 'Division of Pathology, Antwerp University Hospital, 2650 Edegem, Belgium.', 'Division of Pathology, Ghent University Hospital, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Division of Clinical Biology, Antwerp University Hospital, 2650 Edegem, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Physiopharmacology, University of Antwerp, 2610 Wilrijk, Belgium.', 'Division of Clinical Biology, Antwerp University Hospital, 2650 Edegem, Belgium.', 'HistoGeneX, 2610 Wilrijk, Belgium.', 'Division of Clinical Biology, Antwerp University Hospital, 2650 Edegem, Belgium.', 'Division of Clinical Biology, Antwerp University Hospital, 2650 Edegem, Belgium.', 'Division of Hematology, Antwerp University Hospital, 2650 Edegem, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, 2610 Wilrijk, Belgium.', 'Division of Hematology, Antwerp University Hospital, 2650 Edegem, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute (VAXINFECTIO), Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, University of Antwerp, 2610 Wilrijk, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200925,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,PMC7599534,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'FLT3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'immunohistochemistry', 'next-generation sequencing', 'venetoclax']",2020/10/01 06:00,2020/10/01 06:01,['2020/09/30 01:01'],"['2020/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/01 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9103090 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9103090 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Sep 25;9(10). pii: jcm9103090. doi: 10.3390/jcm9103090.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within these disorders, the spectrum of cytogenetic alterations and oncogenic mutations, the extent of a predisposing defective osteohematopoietic niche, and the irregularity of the tumor microenvironment is highly diverse. However, the exact underlying pathophysiological mechanisms resulting in hematopoietic failure in patients with MDS and sAML remain elusive. There is recent evidence that the post-transcriptional control of gene expression mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs), long noncoding RNAs, and/or RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key components in the pathogenic events of both diseases. In addition, an interplay between RBPs and miRNAs has been postulated in MDS and sAML. Although a plethora of miRNAs is aberrantly expressed in MDS and sAML, their expression pattern significantly depends on the cell type and on the molecular make-up of the sample, including chromosomal alterations and single nucleotide polymorphisms, which also reflects their role in disease progression and prediction. Decreased expression levels of miRNAs or RBPs preventing the maturation or inhibiting translation of genes involved in pathogenesis of both diseases were found. Therefore, this review will summarize the current knowledge regarding the heterogeneity of expression, function, and clinical relevance of miRNAs, its link to molecular abnormalities in MDS and sAML with specific focus on the interplay with RBPs, and the current treatment options. This information might improve the use of miRNAs and/or RBPs as prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for both malignancies.","['Bauer, Marcus', 'Vaxevanis, Christoforos', 'Heimer, Nadine', 'Al-Ali, Haifa Kathrin', 'Jaekel, Nadja', 'Bachmann, Michael', 'Wickenhauser, Claudia', 'Seliger, Barbara']","['Bauer M', 'Vaxevanis C', 'Heimer N', 'Al-Ali HK', 'Jaekel N', 'Bachmann M', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Seliger B']",,"['Institute of Pathology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06112 Halle, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Immunology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06112 Halle, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Immunology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06112 Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Halle, 06112 Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Halle, 06112 Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf, Institute of Radiopharmaceutical Cancer Research, 01328 Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06112 Halle, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Immunology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06112 Halle, Germany.', 'Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200927,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*blood/*genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*blood/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome']",PMC7582632,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA-binding protein', 'microRNA', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'secondary acute myeloid leukemia', 'therapy']",2020/10/01 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/09/30 01:01'],"['2020/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21197140 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21197140 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Sep 27;21(19). pii: ijms21197140. doi: 10.3390/ijms21197140.,,,['The authors have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a particular focus on 144 known tumour antigens, we identified STEAP1, SAGE1, MORC4, SLC34A2 and CEACAM3 as significantly different in their expression between standard and low risk paediatric AML patient subgroups, as well as between poor and good, and intermediate and good risk adult AML patient subgroups. We found significant differences in event-free survival (EFS) in paediatric AML patients, when comparing standard and low risk subgroups, and quartile expression levels of BIRC5, MAGEF1, MELTF, STEAP1 and VGLL4. We found significant differences in EFS in adult AML patients when comparing intermediate and good, and poor and good risk adult AML patient subgroups and quartile expression levels of MORC4 and SAGE1, respectively. When examining Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (2016) pathway data, we found that genes altered in AML were involved in key processes such as the evasion of apoptosis (BIRC5, WNT1) or the control of cell proliferation (SSX2IP, AML1-ETO). For the first time we have compared gene expression in paediatric AML patients with that of adult AML patients.

This review discusses how Raman spectra can lead to a deeper molecular understanding of the biochemical changes in cancer cells in comparison to non-cancer cells, analyzing two key examples, leukemia and breast cancer. The reported Raman results provide information on cancer progression and allow the identification, classification, and follow-up after chemotherapy treatments of the cancer cells from the liquid biopsy. The key obstacles for RS applications in cancer cell diagnosis, including quality, objectivity, number of cells and velocity of the analysis, are considered. The use of multivariant analysis, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminate analysis (LDA), for an automatic and objective assessment without any specialized knowledge of spectroscopy is presented. Raman imaging for cancer cell mapping is shown and its advantages for routine clinical pathology practice and live cell imaging, compared to single-point spectral analysis, are debated. Additionally, the combination of RS with microfluidic devices and high-throughput screening for improving the velocity and the number of cells analyzed are also discussed. Finally, the combination of the Raman microscopy (RM) with other imaging modalities, for complete visualization and characterization of the cells, is described.","['Elumalai, Satheeshkumar', 'Manago, Stefano', 'De Luca, Anna Chiara']","['Elumalai S', 'Manago S', 'De Luca AC']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6309-7880', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7445-385X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3696-8465']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (IBBC), National Research Council of Italy (CNR), Via P.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX) analyses showed voltage-dependent (150-300 V) growth of structural (Ra index, mass, and thickness) and morphological surface and volume elements, a low Ca/PaT ratio (0.3-0.6), and the appearance of crystalline phases of CaHPO4 (monetite) and beta-Ca2P2O7 (calcium pyrophosphate). Cell and molecular reactions in 2-day and 14-day cultures differed strongly and correlated with the Ra values. There was significant upregulation of hTERT expression (1.7-fold), IL-17 secretion, the presentation of the activation antigens CD25 (by 2.7%) and CD95 (by 5.15%) on CD4(+) cells, and 1.5-2-fold increased cell apoptosis and necrosis after two days of culture. Hyperactivation-dependent death of CD4(+) cells triggered by the surface roughness of the CaP coating was proposed. Conversely, a 3.2-fold downregulation in hTERT expression increased the percentages of CD4(+) cells and their CD95(+) subset (by 15.5% and 22.9%, respectively) and inhibited the secretion of 17 of 27 test cytokines/chemokines without a reduction in Jurkat T cell survival after 14 days of coculture. Thereafter, cell hypoergy and the selection of an hTERT-independent viable CD4(+) subset of tumor cells were proposed. The possible role of negative zeta potentials and Ca(2+) as effectors of CaP roughness was discussed. The continuous (2-14 days) 1.5-6-fold reductions in the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by tumor cells correlated with the Ra values of microarc CaP-coated Ti substrates seems to limit surgical stress-induced metastasis of lymphoid malignancies.","['Litvinova, Larisa S', 'Khaziakhmatova, Olga G', 'Shupletsova, Valeria V', 'Yurova, Kristina A', 'Malashchenko, Vladimir V', 'Shunkin, Egor O', 'Ivanov, Pavel A', 'Komarova, Ekaterina G', 'Chebodaeva, Valentina V', 'Porokhova, Ekaterina D', 'Gereng, Elena A', 'Khlusov, Igor A']","['Litvinova LS', 'Khaziakhmatova OG', 'Shupletsova VV', 'Yurova KA', 'Malashchenko VV', 'Shunkin EO', 'Ivanov PA', 'Komarova EG', 'Chebodaeva VV', 'Porokhova ED', 'Gereng EA', 'Khlusov IA']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5231-6910', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0903-6750', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3465-8452']","['Center for Immunology and Cell Biotechnology, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, 236029 Kaliningrad, Russia.', 'Center for Immunology and Cell Biotechnology, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, 236029 Kaliningrad, Russia.', 'Center for Immunology and Cell Biotechnology, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, 236029 Kaliningrad, Russia.', 'Center for Immunology and Cell Biotechnology, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, 236029 Kaliningrad, Russia.', 'Center for Immunology and Cell Biotechnology, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, 236029 Kaliningrad, Russia.', 'Center for Immunology and Cell Biotechnology, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, 236029 Kaliningrad, Russia.', 'Center for Immunology and Cell Biotechnology, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, 236029 Kaliningrad, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Physics of Nanostructured Biocomposites, Institute of Strength Physics and Materials Science SB RAS, 634055 Tomsk, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Physics of Nanostructured Biocomposites, Institute of Strength Physics and Materials Science SB RAS, 634055 Tomsk, Russia.', 'Department of Morphology and General Pathology, Siberian State Medical University, 634050 Tomsk, Russia.', 'Department of Morphology and General Pathology, Siberian State Medical University, 634050 Tomsk, Russia.', 'Center for Immunology and Cell Biotechnology, Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University, 236029 Kaliningrad, Russia.', 'Department of Morphology and General Pathology, Siberian State Medical University, 634050 Tomsk, Russia.', 'Research School of Chemistry and Applied Biomedical Sciences, National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University, 634050 Tomsk, Russia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200927,Switzerland,Materials (Basel),"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",101555929,,,,PMC7579201,['NOTNLM'],"['CaP roughness', 'cell behavior in vitro', 'correlations', 'surface electrostatic and electrokinetic potentials', 'titanium substrate']",2020/10/01 06:00,2020/10/01 06:01,['2020/09/30 01:00'],"['2020/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 01:00 [entrez]', '2020/10/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/01 06:01 [medline]']","['ma13194307 [pii]', '10.3390/ma13194307 [doi]']",epublish,Materials (Basel). 2020 Sep 27;13(19). pii: ma13194307. doi: 10.3390/ma13194307.,,['16-15-10031/Russian Science Foundation'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A case of pleural isolated myeloid sarcoma (PIMS) with pleural effusion as the first manifestation was described. The related cases in literatures were reviewed with""myeloid sarcoma""and""pleural effusions""as the keywords to search China HowNet, Wanfang database and PubMed database. Results: A 59-year-old man complained of right chest pain for 2 months and worsening pain with distress and shortness of breath for 2 weeks. The chest CT scan showed pleural effusion on the right side. Flow cytometric analysis of pleural fluid showed that a population of blasts with CD34 expressing was 37.6% of the total nucleated cells. The pleural biopsy through medical thoracoscopy indicated lymphoproliferative lesions by pathological examination. Immunohistochemistry was performed on pleural histological sections and cell blocks of pleural effusions, which showed CD34 and CD117 positive expression. The diagnosis of PIMS was finally made. Two literature papers with 2 complete cases were found and reviewed. The 3 cases were analyzed. There were 2 males and 1 female. The age was 59, 51, 56 years respectively. One case was a patient with 3 weeks of right upper quadrant and epigastric pain, nausea, and weight loss. Cytological examination of the pleural fluid showed numerous poorly differentiated malignant cells. Histology from an open laparotomy in duodenal biopsies, gallbladder, and mesenteric lymph nodes supported the diagnosis of IMS. The other case was a patient with 6 weeks of dyspnea and a large swelling in the upper vestibular region. Thoracentesis showed 82% myeloid blasts in the pleural fluid. A gingival biopsy showed a diffuse infiltration by cells with a blastic appearance and supported IMS. Conclusion: PIMS was a very rare cause of pleural effusions. The cytological and histopathological evidences were useful to diagnose IMS involving the pleural cavity.","['Han, X', 'Xu, J', 'Liu, C F', 'Song, Y', 'Zhao, J J', 'Gao, N', 'Zhao, J']","['Han X', 'Xu J', 'Liu CF', 'Song Y', 'Zhao JJ', 'Gao N', 'Zhao J']",,"['Department of Respiratory, Dalian Municipal Central Hospital, Dalian 116033, China.', 'Department of Respiratory, Dalian Municipal Central Hospital, Dalian 116033, China.', 'Department of Respiratory, Dalian Municipal Central Hospital, Dalian 116033, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Dalian Municipal Central Hospital, Dalian 116033, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalian Municipal Central Hospital, Dalian 116033, China.', 'Department of Respiratory, Dalian Municipal Central Hospital, Dalian 116033, China.', 'Department of Respiratory, Dalian Municipal Central Hospital, Dalian 116033, China.']",['chi'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,8712226,,IM,"['Chest Pain/diagnostic imaging/*etiology', 'China', 'Dyspnea/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pleura', 'Pleural Effusion/*pathology', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Thoracoscopy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Myeloid sarcoma', 'Pleura', 'Pleural effusions']",2020/09/30 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/09/29 22:50'],"['2020/09/29 22:50 [entrez]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200526-00639 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi. 2020 Oct 12;43(10):839-843. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200526-00639.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we present a fully validated dried blood spot (DBS) method for the quantitation of idelalisib from mice blood using an LC-MS/MS, which was operated under multiple reaction monitoring mode. To the punched DBS discs, acidified methanol enriched with internal standard (IS; larotrectinib) was added and extracted using tert-butyl methyl ether as an extraction solvent with sonication. Chromatographic separation of idelalisib and the IS was achieved on an Atlantis dC18 column using a mixture of 10 mM ammonium formate:acetonitrile (25:75, v/v). The flow-rate and injection volume were 0.80 mL/min and 2.0 microL, respectively. Idelalisib and the IS were eluted at ~0.98 and 0.93 min, respectively and the total run time was 2.00 min. Idelalisib and the IS were analyzed using positive ion scan mode and parent-daughter mass to charge ion (m/z) transition of 416.1-->176.1 and 429.1-->342.1, respectively was used for the quantitation. The calibration range was 1.01-4 797 ng/mL. No matrix effect and carry over were observed. Haematocrit did not influence DBS idelalisib concentrations. All the validation parameters met the acceptance criteria. The applicability of the validated method was shown in a mice pharmacokinetic study.","['Tripathy, Harsha K', 'Manju, Nair S V', 'Dittakavi, Sreekanth', 'Zakkula, Ashok', 'Mullangi, Ramesh']","['Tripathy HK', 'Manju NSV', 'Dittakavi S', 'Zakkula A', 'Mullangi R']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5638-327X'],"['Karnataka College of Pharmacy, Thirumenahalli, Bangalore.', 'Karnataka College of Pharmacy, Thirumenahalli, Bangalore.', 'Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Jubilant Biosys Ltd, Industrial Suburb, Yeshwanthpur, Bangalore.', 'Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Jubilant Biosys Ltd, Industrial Suburb, Yeshwanthpur, Bangalore.', 'Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Jubilant Biosys Ltd, Industrial Suburb, Yeshwanthpur, Bangalore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20200929,Germany,Drug Res (Stuttg),Drug research,101602406,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Pik3cd protein, mouse)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/analysis/pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological Availability', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dried Blood Spot Testing/*methods', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Half-Life', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/analysis/pharmacokinetics', 'Purines/administration & dosage/*analysis/pharmacokinetics', 'Quinazolinones/administration & dosage/*analysis/pharmacokinetics', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/methods']",,,,2020/09/30 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2020/09/29 20:17'],"['2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 20:17 [entrez]']",['10.1055/a-1252-2476 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Res (Stuttg). 2021 Jan;71(1):36-42. doi: 10.1055/a-1252-2476.

Patients in certain major stereotyped subsets often display remarkably consistent clinicobiological profiles, suggesting that the study of BcR immunoglobulin stereotypy in CLL has important implications for understanding disease pathophysiology and refining clinical decision-making. Nevertheless, several issues remain open, especially pertaining to the actual frequency of BcR immunoglobulin stereotypy and major subsets, as well as the existence of higher-order connections between individual subsets. To address these issues, we investigated clonotypic IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ gene rearrangements in a series of 29 856 patients with CLL, by far the largest series worldwide. We report that the stereotyped fraction of CLL peaks at 41% of the entire cohort and that all 19 previously identified major subsets retained their relative size and ranking, while 10 new ones emerged; overall, major stereotyped subsets had a cumulative frequency of 13.5%. Higher-level relationships were evident between subsets, particularly for major stereotyped subsets with unmutated IGHV genes (U-CLL), for which close relations with other subsets, termed ""satellites,"" were identified. Satellite subsets accounted for 3% of the entire cohort. These results confirm our previous notion that major subsets can be robustly identified and are consistent in relative size, hence representing distinct disease variants amenable to compartmentalized research with the potential of overcoming the pronounced heterogeneity of CLL. Furthermore, the existence of satellite subsets reveals a novel aspect of repertoire restriction with implications for refined molecular classification of CLL.","['Agathangelidis, Andreas',

Genomic analysis of cancer cells, therefore, has greatly enhanced our ability to identify genetic alterations associated with various cancer types, including both lympho-hematopoietic as well as solid tumors. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), based on the specific diagnostic genetic abnormality has served as a prototype disease to clearly demonstrate the significance of the genomic analysis of cancer in identifying targeted therapy. Such a success has provided extra ordinary opportunities to investigate the role of genetic abnormalities and the pathways amenable to targeted therapy, not only in blood cancers but solid tumors such as Lung, Brain, Colon, Renal, Breast cancers as well as other epithelial and mesenchymal tumors. The main focus of this presentation is to illustrate the role of genomic analysis in targeting lung cancer, based on abnormalities or the pathways deregulated in tumor cells from individual patients. Lung cancer is one of the most common epithelial cancers associated with chronic inflammation due to cigarette smoking and other environmental carcinogens, and includes four distinct histologic type; non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and squamous cell lung cancer. According to current estimates, 1.3 million cases of lung cancer are expected to be diagnosed worldwide annually, resulting in one million deaths. Since the discovery that patient's tumors with specific mutations in the EGFR may be sensitive to targeted therapeutic approach and the subsequent realization that the such mutations in the gene are not as prevalent, several cancer centers including ours initiated intense efforts to find other mutations or genomic alterations, which may serve as targets of specific therapy. Such efforts have successfully resulted in a battery of genes such as KRAS, ALK, C-MET, HER-2/neu, ROS1, etc., which have helped oncologists to triage the patients for personalized therapies. A significant proportion of patients with lung cancer, however, do not show any of the above genetic abnormalities. Approximately 90% of lung cancers exhibit RB1 mutation/deletion and or KRAS mutations, therefore, the signaling pathways, which regulate multistep tumorigenesis in lung cancer, are important for the treatment of histologic subtypes of lung cancer, which includes NSCLC & SCLC. Equally important was the findings that similar signaling pathways are also shared by other solid tumor types. We have investigated the role of these pathways to target these cancers and develop new strategies to treat lung, brain and related cancers. In addition, our translational studies in other tumor types such as NF2 related malignancies, specifically, Malignant Mesothelioma (MM), in which NF2 related pathway amenable to targeted therapies was identified. Selected examples representing experimental approaches will be discussed to illustrate the critical role of translational research in developing novel therapeutics for the successful and durable responses in some of these cancer types.","['Jhanwar, Suresh C', 'Xu, Xiaoliang Leon', 'Elahi, Abul H', 'Abramson, David H']","['Jhanwar SC', 'Xu XL', 'Elahi AH', 'Abramson DH']",,"['Departments of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275, York Avenue, New York, NY, USA.

Tissue decellularization by providing natural 3D and extracellular matrix (ECM) conditions for cell growth can be an alternative procedure to enhance in vitro culture conditions. In the present study, the testicular tissues were taken from brain death donors. After enzymatic digestion, the tissue cells were isolated and cultured for four weeks. Then the identity of the SSCs was confirmed using anti-GFRalpha1 and anti-PLZF antibodies via immunocytochemistry (ICC). The differentiation capacity of SSCs were evaluated by culture of them on a layer of decellularized testicular matrix (DTM) prepared from sheep testis, as well as under two-dimensional (2D) culture with differentiation medium. After four and six weeks of the initiation of differentiation culture, the pre-meiotic, meiotic and post- meiotic genes at the mRNA and protein levels was examined via qPCR and ICC methods, respectively. The results showed that pre-meiotic, meiotic and post-meiotic genes expressions were significantly higher in the cells cultured in DTM substrate (P</=0.01).The present study indicated that, the natural structure of ECM prepare the suitable conditions for further study of the spermatogenesis process in the in vitro and contributes to the maintenance and treatment of male infertility.","['Ashouri Movassagh, Sepideh', 'Ashouri Movassagh, Sanaz', 'Banitalebi Dehkordi, Mehdi', 'Pourmand, Gholamreza', 'Gholami, Keykavos', 'Talebi, Ali', 'Esfandyari, Sahar', 'Jabari, Ayob', 'Samadian, Azam', 'Abbasi, Mehdi']","['Ashouri Movassagh S', 'Ashouri Movassagh S', 'Banitalebi Dehkordi M', 'Pourmand G', 'Gholami K', 'Talebi A', 'Esfandyari S', 'Jabari A', 'Samadian A', 'Abbasi M']",,"['Human and Animal Cell Bank, Iranian Biological Resource Center (IBRC), ACECR, Tehran, Iran; Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Reproductive Biotechnology Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Basic Health Sciences Institute, Shahrekord University of Medical Science, Shahrekord, Iran.', 'Urology Research Center, Sina Hospital, TehranUniversity of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Gametogenesis Research Center, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran.', 'School of Medicine, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Infertility and Reproductive Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shiraz University of Medicine Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Stem Cells and Developmental Biology, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

MLL fusion patterns are associated with the patient's prognosis; however, their relationship with driver mutations is unclear. We conducted sequence analyses of 338 genes in pediatric patients with MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) AML (n = 56; JPLSG AML-05 study) alongside data from the TARGET study's pediatric cohorts with MLL-r AML (n = 104), non-MLL-r AML (n = 581), and adult MLL-r AML (n = 81). KRAS mutations were most frequent in pediatric patients with high-risk MLL fusions (MLL-MLLLT10, MLL-MLLT4, and MLL-MLLT1). Pediatric patients with MLL-r AML (n = 160) and a KRAS mutation (KRAS-MT) had a significantly worse prognosis than those without a KRAS mutation (KRAS-WT) (5-year event-free survival [EFS]: 51.8% vs 18.3%, P < .0001; 5-year overall survival [OS]: 67.3% vs 44.3%, P = .003). The adverse prognostic impact of KRAS mutations was confirmed in adult MLL-r AML. KRAS mutations were associated with adverse prognoses in pediatric patients with both high-risk (MLLT10+MLLT4+MLLT1; n = 60) and intermediate-to-low-risk (MLLT3+ELL+others; n = 100) MLL fusions. The prognosis did not differ significantly between patients with non-MLL-r AML with KRAS-WT or KRAS-MT. Multivariate analysis showed the presence of a KRAS mutation to be an independent prognostic factor for EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-3.59; P = .002) and OS (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.01-3.31; P = .045) in MLL-r AML. The mutation is a distinct adverse prognostic factor in MLL-r AML, regardless of risk subgroup, and is potentially useful for accurate treatment stratification.

Here, we present a machine learning method termed Prediction of Essential Genes in Comparison States (PreEGS). To capture the alteration of the network in comparison states, PreEGS extracts topological and gene expression features of each gene in a five-dimensional vector. PreEGS also recruits a positive sample expansion method to address the problem of unbalanced positive and negative samples, which is often encountered in practical applications. Different classifiers are applied to the simulated datasets, and the PreEGS based on the random forests model (PreEGSRF) was chosen for optimal performance. PreEGSRF was then compared with six other methods, including three machine learning methods, to predict EGS in a specific state. On real datasets with four gene regulatory networks, PreEGSRF predicted five essential genes related to leukemia and five enriched KEGG pathways. Four of the predicted essential genes and all predicted pathways were consistent with previous studies and highly correlated with leukemia. With high prediction accuracy and generalization ability, PreEGSRF is broadly applicable for the discovery of disease-causing genes, driver genes for cell fate decisions, and complex biomarkers of biological systems.","['Xie, Jiang', 'Zhao, Chang', 'Sun, Jiamin', 'Li, Jiaxin', 'Yang, Fuzhang', 'Wang, Jiao', 'Nie, Qing']","['Xie J', 'Zhao C', 'Sun J', 'Li J', 'Yang F', 'Wang J', 'Nie Q']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20211007,United States,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,,IM,,,,,2020/09/30 06:00,2020/09/30 06:00,['2020/09/29 17:12'],"['2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 17:12 [entrez]']",['10.1109/TCBB.2020.3027392 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform. 2021 Sep-Oct;18(5):1784-1792. doi: 10.1109/TCBB.2020.3027392.

In this study, new multi-omics findings in yeast on the mechanism of imatinib are reported, using the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Whole-genome analysis of the transcriptional response of yeast cells following long-term exposure to imatinib, flux-balance analysis (FBA), and modular analysis of protein/protein interaction network consisting of proteins encoded by differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed. DEGs indicated that carbon, nitrogen, starch, sucrose, glyoxylate/dicarboxylate metabolism, valine and leucine degradation, and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) were significantly upregulated. By contrast, ribosome biogenesis, pentose/glucuronate interconversion, tryptophan/pyruvate metabolic pathways, and meiosis were significantly downregulated. FBA revealed that a large set of metabolic pathways was altered by imatinib to compensate cancer-associated metabolic changes. Integration of transcriptome and interactome (protein/protein interactions) data helped to identify the core regulatory genes and pathways through elucidation of the active subnetworks. It appears that imatinib may also contribute to antitumoral immune response in the tumor microenvironment and most of the metabolic rearrangements are at posttranscriptional level. Furthermore, additional support for possible contribution of thiamine/pyridoxal phosphate biosynthesis and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to drug resistance is noted. This report advances multi-omics understanding of the mechanism of imatinib, and by extension, offers new molecular avenues toward precision medicine and discovery of novel drug targets in cancer therapeutics.","['Taymaz-Nikerel, Hilal', 'Eraslan, Serpil', 'Kirdar, Betul']","['Taymaz-Nikerel H', 'Eraslan S', 'Kirdar B']",,"['Department of Genetics and Bioengineering, Istanbul Bilgi University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Koc University Hospital, Diagnosis Center for Genetic Disorders, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200929,United States,OMICS,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/drug effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*drug effects/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*imatinib', '*multi-omics', '*protein/protein interactions', '*systems biology', '*yeast']",2020/09/30 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2020/09/29 17:11'],"['2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 17:11 [entrez]']",['10.1089/omi.2020.0144 [doi]'],ppublish,OMICS. 2020 Nov;24(11):667-678. doi: 10.1089/omi.2020.0144.

PROCEDURE: In order to identify prognostic factors and improve their prognosis, we analyzed 111 patients who relapsed after treatment with the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG) AML-05 protocol and who were registered in the retrospective JPLSG AML-05R study. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival rate was 36.1%. The major determinant of survival was duration from the diagnosis to relapse. The mean duration in the nonsurviving group (10.1 +/- 4.1 months) was shorter than that in the surviving group (16.3 +/- 8.3 months) (P < .01). Moreover, achieving a second complete remission (CR2) prior to HCT was associated with a good prognosis (P < .01). Etoposide, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone (ECM)- or fludarabine, cytarabine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG)-based regimens were therefore recommended for reinduction therapy (P < .01). A genetic analysis also revealed the prognostic significance of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication as a poor prognostic marker (P = .04) and core binding factor-AML, t(8;21), and inv(16) as good prognostic markers (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Achieving a CR2 prior to HCT is important in order to improve the prognosis of relapsed pediatric AML. Recent molecular targeted therapies, such as FLT3 inhibitors, may contribute to overcome their prognoses. Larger prospective investigations are necessary to establish individualized treatment strategies for patients with relapsed childhood AML.","['Moritake, Hiroshi', 'Tanaka, Shiro', 'Miyamura, Takako', 'Nakayama, Hideki', 'Shiba, Norio', 'Shimada, Akira', 'Terui, Kiminori', 'Yuza, Yuki', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Goto, Hiroaki', 'Kakuda, Harumi', 'Saito, Akiko', 'Hasegawa, Daisuke', 'Iwamoto, Shotaro', 'Taga, Takashi', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke']","['Moritake H', 'Tanaka S', 'Miyamura T', 'Nakayama H', 'Shiba N', 'Shimada A', 'Terui K', 'Yuza Y', 'Koh K', 'Goto H', 'Kakuda H', 'Saito A', 'Hasegawa D', 'Iwamoto S', 'Taga T', 'Adachi S', 'Tomizawa D']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5471-7646', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3226-556X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1994-113X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1294-8635', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9446-9568', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7710-2449', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0525-4766', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1520-7007']","['Division of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Biostatistics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Tokyo Metropolitan Children's Medical Center, Fuchu, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", ""Division of Hemato-oncology/Regenerative Medicine, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Chiba Children's Hospital, Chiba, Japan."", 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', ""Division of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200929,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*FLT3-ITD', '*core binding factor', '*pediatric acute myeloid leukemia', '*reinduction therapy', '*relapse']",2020/09/30 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/09/29 12:40'],"['2020/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 12:40 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28736 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 Jan;68(1):e28736. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28736.

This deamination leads to samples stability issues with respect to clinical pharmacokinetic trials. The aim of our study was to study in vitro cytarabine stability in blood samples obtained from AML patients. METHODS: Cytarabine quantification was performed using a fully validated LC/MS/MS method. In vitro cytarabine stability was assessed at room temperature over 24 h in samples coming from 14 AML patients and 7 control patients (CTRL) with no hematological malignancy. In vitro concentrations versus time data were analyzed using a noncompartmental approach. RESULTS: Cytarabine in vitro area under the curve (AUCIVlast) was 22-fold higher in AML samples as compared to CTRL samples (AML mean (standard deviation (SD)), 51,829 (27,004) h ng/mL; CTRL mean (SD), 2356 (1250) h ng/mL, p = 0.00019). This increase was associated with a prolonged in vitro degradation half-life (t1/2IVdeg AML mean (SD), 15 (11.8) h; CTRL mean (SD), 0.36 (0.37) h, p = 0.0033). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that AML diagnosis significantly influenced t1/2IVdeg and AUCIVlas relationship. CONCLUSION: Cytarabine stability is higher in AML than in CTRL samples. The absence of correlation between t1/2IVdeg and AUCIVlast in AML samples suggests that in vitro cytarabine degradation in AML is complex.

There is an increased propensity to develop myeloid malignancy (MM) - acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms or myelodysplastic syndrome often in association with secondary somatic variants in other genes. To date, 23 FPD-MM pediatric cases have been reported worldwide. Here, we present two new kindreds with novel RUNX1 pathogenic variants in which children are probands. The first family is a daughter/mother diad, sharing a heterozygous frameshift variant in RUNX1 gene (c.501delT p.Ser167Argfs*9). The daughter, age 13 years, presented with features resembling juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia - severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, high white cell count with blast cells, monocytosis, increased nucleated red cells and had somatic mutations with high allele burden in CUX1, PHF6, and SH2B3 genes. She also had increased fetal hemoglobin and increased LIN28B expression. The mother, who had a long history of hypoplastic anemia, had different somatic mutations- a non-coding mutation in CUX1 but none in PHF6 or SH2B3. Her fetal hemoglobin and LIN28B expression were normal. In the second kindred, the proband, now 4 years old with thrombocytopenia alone, was investigated at 3 months of age for persistent neonatal thrombocytopenia with large platelets. Molecular testing identified a heterozygous intragenic deletion in RUNX1 encompassing exon 5. His father is known to have increased bruising for several years but is unavailable for testing. These two cases illustrate the significance of secondary mutations in the development and progression of RUNX1-FPD to MM.","['Bagla, Shruti', 'Regling, Katherine A', 'Wakeling, Erin N', 'Gadgeel, Manisha', 'Buck, Steven', 'Zaidi, Ahmar U', 'Flore, Leigh A', 'Chicka, Michael', 'Schiffer, Charles A', 'Chitlur, Meera B', 'Ravindranath, Yaddanapudi']","['Bagla S', 'Regling KA', 'Wakeling EN', 'Gadgeel M', 'Buck S', 'Zaidi AU', 'Flore LA', 'Chicka M', 'Schiffer CA', 'Chitlur MB', 'Ravindranath Y']",,"['Department of Pediatrics-Hematology/Oncology, Wayne State University-School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan, USA."", 'DMC University Laboratories, Detroit Medical Center, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics-Hematology/Oncology, Wayne State University-School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics-Hematology/Oncology, Wayne State University-School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', ""Division of Genetic, Genomic and Metabolic Disorders, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan, USA."", 'Prevention Genetics, Marshfield, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics-Hematology/Oncology, Wayne State University-School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan.', 'Department of Pediatrics-Hematology/Oncology, Wayne State University-School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics-Hematology/Oncology, Wayne State University-School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200929,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['JMML', 'LIN28B and Fetal hemoglobin', 'RUNX1 familial platelet disorder', 'myeloproliferative disorder', 'sea blue histiocytes']",2020/09/30 06:00,2021/06/03 06:00,['2020/09/29 12:33'],"['2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 12:33 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2020.1814463 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Feb;38(1):65-79. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2020.1814463.

Despite withdrawal from the market after accelerated approval, GO was reapproved and now has a well-established role in treating select AML patients. CD33 has proven to be an important target for drug development in AML as evidenced by the improvement in survival with GO treatment. AREAS COVERED: The review summarizes the development of GO, its mechanism of action, initial studies and approval, withdrawal from the market, and subsequent reapproval after the results of several large randomized studies became available. We also provide an overview of its current role in the treatment landscape of AML. EXPERT OPINION: Multiple phase 3 trials with GO have established a significant benefit with GO in induction therapy for favorable risk AML. Additional studies support the use of GO in relapsed/refractory AML and APL. Despite the withdrawal of GO from the market after initial approval, GO has proven to improve survival of select AML patients when added to induction chemotherapy and in relapsed disease.","['Goldenson, Benjamin H', 'Goodman, Aaron M', 'Ball, Edward D']","['Goldenson BH', 'Goodman AM', 'Ball ED']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8024-4210'],"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201005,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Gemtuzumab ozogamicin', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant', 'venous occlusive disease']",2020/09/30 06:00,2020/09/30 06:00,['2020/09/29 12:33'],"['2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 12:33 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14712598.2021.1825678 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2021 Jul;21(7):849-862. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2021.1825678.

Imiquimod has also been used off-label in various other skin conditions (eg, Bowen's disease, lentigo maligna, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia). As a toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist imiquimod induces a local inflammatory response by increased production of cytokines, co-stimulatory molecules, activation of Nk-cells and antigen-specific T-cells. In addition to imiquimod-associated adverse effects at non-application sites such as fever, vertigo or myalgia there have been anecdotal reports of distant inflammatory mucosal reactions-a side effect not declared in the medicinal product information. In this scoping review we collected a total of seven cases of patients with lesions of the oral mucosa and lips and summarized pathophysiological hypotheses to explain this type of side effect. The review is complemented with an illustrated report of a 87-year-old female patient of ours suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who developed severe oral mucosal and labial reactions following application of imiquimod 3.75% for treatment of AKs. She denied accidental transfer of imiquimod and was tested negative for herpes simplex virus (PCR) and bacteria (culture) from lesional swabs.","['Hammerl, Veronika', 'Parlar, Betul', 'Navarini, Alexander', 'Gantenbein, Lorena', 'Vath, Helga', 'Mueller, Simon M']","['Hammerl V', 'Parlar B', 'Navarini A', 'Gantenbein L', 'Vath H', 'Mueller SM']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5138-759X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0200-4254']","['Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Private Dermatology Practice, Binningen, Switzerland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20201019,United States,Dermatol Ther,Dermatologic therapy,9700070,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Aminoquinolines)', 'P1QW714R7M (Imiquimod)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/adverse effects', 'Administration, Topical', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aminoquinolines/adverse effects', '*Carcinoma, Basal Cell/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imiquimod/adverse effects', '*Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Aphthosis', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*imiquimod', '*mucosal', '*side effects']",2020/09/30 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2020/09/29 09:24'],"['2020/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 09:24 [entrez]']",['10.1111/dth.14355 [doi]'],ppublish,Dermatol Ther. 2021 Jan;34(1):e14355. doi: 10.1111/dth.14355.

However, IFNs are usually generated in vivo together with other cytokines that also have immunoregulatory functions, but such interactions are poorly defined experimentally. We measured the effects of type I (IFN-alpha) IFN, elevated in both RA and SLE, on the functions of healthy neutrophils incubated in vitro in the absence and presence of proinflammatory cytokines typically elevated in inflammatory diseases [tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)]. IFN-alpha alone had no effect on neutrophil apoptosis; however, it abrogated the anti-apoptotic effect of GM-CSF (18 h, P < 0.01). The enhanced stability of the anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (Mcl-1) and delayed activation of caspase activation normally regulated by GM-CSF were blocked by IFN-alpha: this effect was mediated, in part, by activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). IFN-alpha alone also primed reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and maintained the transient priming effect of TNF-alpha for up to 4 h: it also down-regulated GM-CSF- and TNF-alpha-activated expression of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8, CCL3 and CCL4 but, in contrast, increased the expression of CXCL10. These novel data identify complex regulatory signalling networks in which type I IFNs profoundly alter the response of neutrophils to inflammatory cytokines. This is likely to have important consequences in vivo and may explain the complexity and heterogeneity of inflammatory diseases such as RA, in which multiple cytokine cascades have been activated.","['Glennon-Alty, L', 'Moots, R J', 'Edwards, S W', 'Wright, H L']","['Glennon-Alty L', 'Moots RJ', 'Edwards SW', 'Wright HL']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7019-6211', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0442-3134']","['Institute of Life Course and Medical Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, UK.', 'Liverpool Health Partners, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, UK.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Aintree University Hospital, Liverpool, UK.', 'Institute of Infection, Veterinary and Ecological Science, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, UK.', 'Institute of Life Course and Medical Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201015,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*metabolism', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*immunology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC7806414,['NOTNLM'],"['*ROS', '*apoptosis', '*interferon alpha', '*neutrophil', '*p38 MAPK']",2020/09/30 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2020/09/29 09:23'],"['2020/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 09:23 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cei.13525 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2021 Feb;203(2):151-159. doi: 10.1111/cei.13525.

METHODS: KG-1 and THP-1 cells treated with 25, 50, 75, 100 or 150 mug/mL EGCG for 48 h were examined for CHD5 gene methylation using MSP and for cell proliferation using MTT assay. The changes in cell cycle and apoptosis of the two cell lines after treatment with EGCG for 48 h were detected using flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expressions of DNMT1, CHD5, p19(Arf), p53 and p21(Cip1) in the cells were detected using RT-quantitative PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: EGCG dose-dependently reversed hypermethylation of CHD5 gene and reduced the cell viability in both KG-1 and THP-1 cells (P < 0.05). EGCG treatment caused obvious cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, significantly increased cell apoptosis, downregulated the expression of DNMT1 and upregulated the expressions of CHD5, p19(Arf), p53 and p21(Cip1) in KG-1 and THP-1 cells (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EGCG reduces hypermethylation of CHD5 gene in KG-1 and THP-1 cells by downregulating DNMT1 to restore its expression, which results in upregulated expressions of p19(Arf), p53 and p21(Cip1) and induces cell apoptosis.","['Wu, Mingcai', 'Jiang, Ming', 'Xue, Mengya', 'Li, Qing', 'Cheng, Bing', 'Huang, Mengzhu', 'Xu, Lei', 'Zhang, Yao']","['Wu M', 'Jiang M', 'Xue M', 'Li Q', 'Cheng B', 'Huang M', 'Xu L', 'Zhang Y']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241002, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Active Biological Macromolecules, Wuhu 241002, China.', 'Wuhu Second Sanatorium for Retired Cadres, Anhui Provincial Military Command, Wuhu 241002, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241002, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241002, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241002, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241002, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241002, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Active Biological Macromolecules, Wuhu 241002, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241002, China.', 'Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Active Biological Macromolecules, Wuhu 241002, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (cadherin 5)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Apoptosis', 'Cadherins', 'Catechin/analogs & derivatives', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Demethylation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",PMC7544577,['NOTNLM'],"['CHD5 gene', 'acute myleoid leukemia', 'epigallocatechin gallate', 'methylation', 'p19Arf-p53-p21Cip1 signaling pathway']",2020/09/30 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/09/29 09:20'],"['2020/09/29 09:20 [entrez]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.09.02 [doi]'],ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2020 Sep 30;40(9):1230-1238. doi: 10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.09.02.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Convalescent plasma, a method of passive immunization that has been applied to prior viral pandemics, holds promise as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Immunocompromised patients may experience more benefit from convalescent plasma given underlying deficits in B and T cell immunity as well as contraindications to antiviral and immunomodulatory therapy. We describe our institutional experience with four immunosuppressed patients (two kidney transplant recipients, one lung transplant recipient, and one chronic myelogenous leukemia patient) treated with COVID-19 convalescent plasma through the Expanded Access Program (NCT04338360). All patients clinically improved after administration (two fully recovered and two discharged to skilled nursing facilities) and none experienced a transfusion reaction. We also report the characteristics of convalescent plasma product from a local blood center including positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG and negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR in all samples tested. This preliminary evidence suggest that convalescent plasma may be safe among immunosuppressed patients with COVID-19 and emphasizes the need for further data on the efficacy of convalescent plasma as either primary or adjunctive therapy for COVID-19.","['Fung, Monica', 'Nambiar, Ashok', 'Pandey, Suchi', 'Aldrich, J Matthew', 'Teraoka, Justin', 'Freise, Christopher', 'Roberts, John', 'Chandran, Sindhu', 'Hays, Steven R', 'Bainbridge, Emma', 'DeVoe, Catherine', 'Roque Gardner, Annelys', 'Yokoe, Deborah', 'Henrich, Timothy J', 'Babik, Jennifer M', 'Chin-Hong, Peter']","['Fung M', 'Nambiar A', 'Pandey S', 'Aldrich JM', 'Teraoka J', 'Freise C', 'Roberts J', 'Chandran S', 'Hays SR', 'Bainbridge E', 'DeVoe C', 'Roque Gardner A', 'Yokoe D', 'Henrich TJ', 'Babik JM', 'Chin-Hong P']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1725-5259', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4547-3381', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6684-0622', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6914-4959']","['Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, C,, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Transplant Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Transplant Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201129,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'COVID-19 serotherapy']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'COVID-19/immunology/*therapy', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Passive/methods', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC7537112,['NOTNLM'],"['*COVID-19', '*convalescent plasma', '*immunocompromised', '*transplant']",2020/09/30 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2020/09/29 05:40'],"['2020/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 05:40 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tid.13477 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2021 Apr;23(2):e13477. doi: 10.1111/tid.13477.

We evaluated TKI treatment changes and how switching affects clinical response in patients recruited in Europe with >/=3 years of follow-up. METHODS: The SIMPLICITY European cohort (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, and Spain) included 431 patients. 370 (86%) were followed for >/=3 years. RESULTS: Proportions of patients experiencing treatment interruptions, TKI switching, and discontinuations decreased over 3 years' follow-up. Intolerance was a key driver for treatment changes. Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was achieved in 87.5% of patients switching TKI within 3 years of initiation vs 91.7% of non-switchers. Major molecular response (MMR) was achieved in 82.4% of switchers vs 92.9% of non-switchers. Over 3 years, not switching TKI was a strong predictor for achieving CCyR or MMR (both P < .05). Three-year survival remained high, irrespective of treatment changes (95.3% switchers, 96.4% non-switchers). CONCLUSIONS: European patients with CP-CML who do not switch TKI are more likely to achieve clinical response, while intolerance is a key driver for switching. Successful CML management may require careful selection of initial TKI, with early monitoring of response and intolerance.","['Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Chen, Clara', 'Davis, Catherine', 'Sen, Ginny P', 'Guyan, Christy', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Paquette, Ronald', 'Goldberg, Stuart L']","['Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Chen C', 'Davis C', 'Sen GP', 'Guyan C', 'Hehlmann R', 'Michallet M', 'Paquette R', 'Goldberg SL']",,"['University of Milano Bicocca, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'ICON plc, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'ICON plc, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'European LeukemiaNet (ELN), Weinheim, Germany.', 'Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Pierre-Benite, France.', 'Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201009,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Disease Management', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC7756290,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL positive', '*chronic', '*chronic-phase', '*dasatinib', '*imatinib mesylate', '*leukemia', '*myeloid', '*observational studies']",2020/09/30 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/09/29 05:39'],"['2020/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 05:39 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13524 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2021 Jan;106(1):82-89. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13524.

METHODS: MTS, flow cytometric and TUNEL assays were performed to assess cell viability and apoptosis. BP and BP/LPPC complex delivery efficiency was analyzed by full-wavelength fluorescent scanner and fluorescence microscope. The expressions of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related proteins were conducted by Western blotting. RESULTS: The results showed that BP inhibited leukemia cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. LPPC-encapsulated BP rapidly induced endocytic pathway activation, resulting in the internalization of BP into leukemia cells, causing cell apoptosis within 1 h. CONCLUSIONS: LPPC encapsulation enhanced the cytotoxic activity of BP and did not influence the effects of BP induction that suggested LPPC-encapsulated BP might be developed as anti-leukemia drugs in future.","['Huang, X-F', 'Chen, P-T', 'Lin, Y-L', 'Lee, M-S', 'Chang, K-F', 'Liao, K-W', 'Sheu, G-T', 'Hsieh, M-C', 'Tsai, N-M']","['Huang XF', 'Chen PT', 'Lin YL', 'Lee MS', 'Chang KF', 'Liao KW', 'Sheu GT', 'Hsieh MC', 'Tsai NM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2629-1833'],"['Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, 40201, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory and Biotechnology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, 40201, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, 40201, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Agricultural Biotechnology Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, 11529, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory and Biotechnology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, 40201, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, 40201, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, 40201, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory and Biotechnology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, 40201, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, 30010, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine and Bioengineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, 30010, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, 40201, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory and Biotechnology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, 40201, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, 40201, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory and Biotechnology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, 40201, Taiwan, ROC. numan@csmu.edu.tw.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, 40201, Taiwan, ROC. numan@csmu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200928,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phthalic Anhydrides)', '0 (Polyelectrolytes)', '0 (polycations)', 'S9178G4B3F (butylidenephthalide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival', '*Drug Carriers', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Nanotechnology', 'Phthalic Anhydrides/*administration & dosage', 'Polyelectrolytes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell apoptosis', 'Cell cycle', 'Leukemia', 'Polycationic liposome containing PEI and polyethylene glycol complex (LPPC)', 'n-Butylidenephthalide (BP)']",2020/09/30 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/09/29 05:38'],"['2020/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 05:38 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-020-02500-w [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-020-02500-w [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2021 Jun;23(6):1142-1151. doi: 10.1007/s12094-020-02500-w.

We explored risk of FCR and associated factors in a nation-wide, population-based cohort of YACS. METHODS: All 5-year survivors diagnosed at the ages of 19-39 years with breast cancer (BC), malignant melanoma (MM), colorectal cancer (CRC), leukemia (LEU), or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) between 1985 and 2009 in Norway were identified by the Cancer Registry of Norway and completed the cross-sectional comprehensive NOR-CAYACS health survey. Univariate and multivariate linear regression modeling was performed. RESULTS: In total, 936 survivors were included, with an average of 16 years since diagnoses. BC was the most prevalent cancer form (38.4%), followed by MM (24.7%), NHL (15.6%), CRC (11.8%), and LEU (9.6%). Survivors worried most about getting another cancer (74%), and (20%) reported quite a bit or a lot of FCR. BC and MM survivors had the highest FCR scores. Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) had the strongest association with FCR (Std B 0.21, p < 0.01), above demographic and clinical variables. CONCLUSIONS: FCR is prevalent even among long-term YACS, including survivors of MM with favorable prognoses. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Attention to ongoing risks of PTSS and FCR in this growing survivor population is warranted to optimize future survivorship care.","['Vandraas, Kathrine F', 'Reinertsen, Kristin V', 'Kiserud, Cecilie E', 'Lie, Hanne C']","['Vandraas KF', 'Reinertsen KV', 'Kiserud CE', 'Lie HC']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3665-6090'],"['National Advisory Unit for Late Effects After Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway. kathvandraas@gmail.com.', 'National Advisory Unit for Late Effects After Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'National Advisory Unit for Late Effects After Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'National Advisory Unit for Late Effects After Cancer Treatment, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Behavioral Sciences in Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200928,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adult', '*Breast Neoplasms', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Fear', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', '*Phobic Disorders', 'Young Adult']",PMC8272704,['NOTNLM'],"['*Fear of cancer recurrence', '*Long-term survivors', '*Post-traumatic stress', '*YACSs']",2020/09/30 06:00,2021/11/26 06:00,['2020/09/29 05:38'],"['2020/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 05:38 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11764-020-00943-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11764-020-00943-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2021 Aug;15(4):497-508. doi: 10.1007/s11764-020-00943-2.

Several genes were reported to be associated with the pathogenesis of leukemia. These genes were computationally analyzed to decipher their codon usage bias (CUB) and to identify the prime factors influencing the codon usage profile as no work was reported yet. The mean values of synonymous codon usage order (SCUO) parameter indicated low CUB of the genes. Significant positive association of SCUO with overall GC and positional GCs might signal the presence of mutational pressure. However, neutrality plot suggested the dominant role of natural selection across the genes. Along with natural selection, the role of mutation pressure was also prominent and that might be responsible for lower CUB (SCUO = 0.19) of genes. Low translational speed might permit accuracy in the process. A strong inverse relationship of translational rate was observed with CUB of genes and folding energy.","['Chakraborty, Supriyo', 'Nath, Durbba', 'Paul, Sunanda', 'Choudhury, Yashmin', 'Ahn, Yeongseon', 'Cho, Yoon Shin', 'Uddin, Arif']","['Chakraborty S', 'Nath D', 'Paul S', 'Choudhury Y', 'Ahn Y', 'Cho YS', 'Uddin A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5996-2760'],"['Department of Biotechnology, Assam University, Silchar, Assam, 788011, India. supriyoch_2008@rediffmail.com.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Assam University, Silchar, Assam, 788011, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Assam University, Silchar, Assam, 788011, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Assam University, Silchar, Assam, 788011, India.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Hallym University, Hallymdachak-gil, Chuncheon, 24252, Gangwon-do, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Hallym University, Hallymdachak-gil, Chuncheon, 24252, Gangwon-do, Korea.', 'Department of Zoology, Moinul Hoque Choudhury Memorial Science College, Algapur, Hailakandi, Assam, 788150, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200928,United States,Biochem Genet,Biochemical genetics,0126611,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['*Codon', 'Codon Usage', 'Computational Biology', '*DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Genes, Neoplasm', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides/genetics', 'Protein Folding', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Selection, Genetic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Codon usage bias', 'Directional mutational pressure', 'Folding energy', 'Leukemia', 'Translational speed']",2020/09/30 06:00,2021/07/09 06:00,['2020/09/29 05:38'],"['2020/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 05:38 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10528-020-10000-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s10528-020-10000-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Genet. 2021 Feb;59(1):235-255. doi: 10.1007/s10528-020-10000-3.

Proteoglycans and ergosterol are considered the key compounds of AbM for antitumor properties and so are used in complementary and alternative medicine as an anticancer drug. AbM is used to avoid serious side effects that would inevitably affect patients. Currently, the efficacy of AbM against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has not been established. The present study aimed to investigate the antitumor activities of the acidic RNA protein complex, FA-2-b-beta, extracted from wild edible AbM. The CML K562 cells or primary CML bone marrow (BM) cells were treated with FA-2-b-beta at different concentrations and time points. CML cell line proliferation and apoptosis were determined using the CCK-8 assay or Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) labeling, RT-qPCR and western blotting was performed to determine the involvement of the Wnt/beta-catenin-associated apoptotic pathway. The results of the present study demonstrated that FA-2-b-beta has a high anti-proliferative potency and strong pro-apoptotic effects. Thus, daily intake of mushrooms containing FA-2-b-beta may be an adequate source as an alternative medicine in the management of CML, and may provide useful information for the development of a novel therapeutic target in this area.","['Sun, Yanqing', 'Cheng, Mingxia', 'Dong, Li', 'Yang, Kehu', 'Ma, Zhiyuan', 'Yu, Shangrui', 'Yan, Peijing', 'Bai, Kuntian', 'Zhu, Xiaolong', 'Zhang, Qike']","['Sun Y', 'Cheng M', 'Dong L', 'Yang K', 'Ma Z', 'Yu S', 'Yan P', 'Bai K', 'Zhu X', 'Zhang Q']",,"['Department of Hematology, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, P.R.

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a disorder of hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, results in marrow failure, which increases the risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Few studies had reported patients who have suffered from both ESCC and MDS/AML simultaneously. To identify possible potential associations between ESCC and MDS/AML, the present case report describes a patient with both types of these tumors at the same time. Following endoscopic biopsy, the patient was revealed to have moderately differentiated SCC. MDS with excess blasts was subsequently diagnosed following bone marrow aspiration. The results of next-generation sequencing revealed that TP53 and ROS1 were both found in ESCC and MDS/AML tumors. The patient refused therapeutic intervention and died within 20 days. The current report demonstrated that hematologic malignancies presenting alongside solid tumors should be considered clinically. In addition, the report indicated that bone marrow puncture should be performed in patients with solid tumors and abnormal blood test results. Next-generation sequencing may be a useful technique for the investigation of patients with two or more neoplasms.

The RAS exchange factor RASGRP1 is frequently overexpressed in T-ALL patients. In T-ALL cell lines overexpression of RASGRP1 increases flux through the RASGTP/RasGDP cycle. Here we expanded RASGRP1 expression surveys in pediatric T-ALL and generated a RoLoRiG mouse model crossed to Mx1CRE to determine the consequences of induced RASGRP1 overexpression in primary hematopoietic cells. RASGRP1-overexpressing, GFP-positive cells outcompeted wild type cells and dominated the peripheral blood compartment over time. RASGRP1 overexpression bestows gain-of-function colony formation properties to bone marrow progenitors in medium containing limited growth factors. RASGRP1 overexpression enhances baseline mTOR-S6 signaling in the bone marrow, but not in vitro cytokine-induced signals. In agreement with these mechanistic findings, hRASGRP1-ires-EGFP enhances fitness of stem- and progenitor- cells, but only in the context of native hematopoiesis. RASGRP1 overexpression is distinct from KRAS(G12D) or NRAS(G12D), does not cause acute leukemia on its own, and leukemia virus insertion frequencies predict that RASGRP1 overexpression can effectively cooperate with lesions in many other genes to cause acute T-ALL.","['Karra, Laila', 'Romero-Moya, Damia', 'Ksionda, Olga', 'Krush, Milana', 'Gu, Zhaohui', 'Mues, Marsilius', 'Depeille, Philippe', 'Mullighan, Charles', 'Roose, Jeroen P']","['Karra L', 'Romero-Moya D', 'Ksionda O', 'Krush M', 'Gu Z', 'Mues M', 'Depeille P', 'Mullighan C', 'Roose JP']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5503-2809', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1871-1850', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4746-2811']","['Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA.', 'Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA.', ""Department of Pathology and Hematological Malignancies Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", 'Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA.', 'Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Friedrich-Ebert-Str. 68, 51429, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.', 'Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA.', ""Department of Pathology and Hematological Malignancies Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", 'Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA. jeroen.roose@ucsf.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200928,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (RASGRP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Transplantation Chimera']",PMC7655557,,,2020/09/30 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/09/29 05:34'],"['2020/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 05:34 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-020-01469-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-020-01469-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2020 Nov;39(45):6920-6934. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-01469-8.

The genetic spectrum of PCM has been expanded to mutations such as KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF genes in the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway. In this study, we have evaluated the frequency of these mutations and their significance, including baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes. Methods: We explored 50 patients who were newly diagnosed with PCM between 2009 and 2012 at a single Korean institute. Clinical and laboratory parameters were gathered through careful review of medical records. Mutation analysis was carried out using DNA from the bone marrow at the time of diagnosis. Pyrosequencing was performed to detect KRAS G12V, KRAS G13D, and NRAS G61R. BRAF V600E was analyzed by allele-specific real- time PCR. Comparison of clinical and laboratory parameters was carried out according to those mutations. Results: We identified 14 patients (28%) with activating mutations in the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway (RAS/RAF mutations): KRAS (N=3), NRAS (N=4), BRAF (N=7), and both KRAS and BRAF (N=1). RAS/RAF mutations were more frequently observed in patients with complex karyotypes and showed poorer progression free survival (PFS). Specifically, the BRAF V600E mutation had a significantly negative impact on median PFS. Conclusion: We first showed the frequency of RAS/RAF mutations in Korean patients with PCM. Screening of these mutations could be considered as a routine clinical test at the time of diagnosis and follow-up due to their influence on clinical outcome, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target.","['Kim, Yonggoo', 'Park, Sung-Soo', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Lee, Gun Dong', 'Son, Jungok', 'Jo, Sung Jin', 'Han, Eunhee', 'Han, Kyungja', 'Kim, Myungshin']","['Kim Y', 'Park SS', 'Min CK', 'Lee GD', 'Son J', 'Jo SJ', 'Han E', 'Han K', 'Kim M']",,"[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Catholic Genetic Laboratory Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,PMC7536562,['NOTNLM'],"['BRAF', 'KRAS', 'NRAS', 'Plasma cell myeloma']",2020/09/30 06:00,2020/09/30 06:01,['2020/09/29 05:32'],"['2020/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/29 05:32 [entrez]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/30 06:01 [medline]']","['br.2020.2020137 [pii]', '10.5045/br.2020.2020137 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Res. 2020 Sep 30;55(3):159-168. doi: 10.5045/br.2020.2020137.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To assess prognosis of patients with recurrent AML post allo-HCT over time, we analyzed European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry data of 8,162 adult patients with AML who relapsed between 2000 and 2018 after allo-HCT performed in first complete remission from matched sibling, unrelated, or haploidentical donors. RESULTS: The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate from relapse was 17%. For 3,630 patients, <50 years of age, the 2-year OS continuously increased from 16% between 2000 and 2004 to 18% for 2005-2009, to 21% for 2010-2014, and to 26% for 2015-2018 (P = 0.001). Improvement over time was noted both after relapse within and beyond 6 months from allo-HCT. On multivariate analysis among patients <50 years of age, OS was positively affected by a later year of relapse (baseline: 2000-2004; HR, 0.82; P < 0.02 for 2010-2014 and HR, 0.72; P = 0.0002 for 2015-2018), good performance status, favorable cytogenetics, and longer time from transplant to relapse, but negatively affected by increasing age. In contrast, among 4,532 patients, >50 years of age, the year of relapse had no influence on OS (16% for 2000-2004 and 14% for 2015-2018; P = 0.56). Regarding treatment, encouraging results were observed after second allo-HCT, which was performed within 2 years after relapse in 17% of the entire cohort, resulting in a 2-year OS of 30.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Outcome after posttransplant relapse among younger patients has improved significantly in recent years, likely reflecting, among other factors, the efficacy of posttransplant salvage including second allo-HCT.","['Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Wolfgang Blau, Igor', 'Potter, Victoria', 'Niittyvuopio, Riitta', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Abou Dalle, Iman', 'Spyridonidis, Alexandros', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Bazarbachi A', 'Schmid C', 'Labopin M', 'Beelen D', 'Wolfgang Blau I', 'Potter V', 'Niittyvuopio R', 'Socie G', 'Blaise D', 'Sanz J', 'Ciceri F', 'Abou Dalle I', 'Spyridonidis A', 'Bug G', 'Esteve J', 'Savani BN', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6934-4619', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3097-2532', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3304-9965']","['Bone marrow Transplant Program, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon. bazarbac@aub.edu.lb.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Augsburg University Hospital and Medical Faculty, Augsburg, Germany. bazarbac@aub.edu.lb.', 'Department of Haematology and EBMT Paris Study Office/CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik m.

While venetoclax, a Bcl-2-selective inhibitor, has had success in the clinic, another family member, Bcl-xL, has also emerged as an important target and as a mechanism of resistance. Therefore, we developed a dual Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor that broadens the therapeutic activity while minimizing Bcl-xL-mediated thrombocytopenia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used structure-based chemistry to design a small-molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and assessed the activity against in vitro cell lines, patient samples, and in vivo models. We applied pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling to integrate our understanding of on-target activity of the dual inhibitor in tumors and platelets across dose levels and over time. RESULTS: We discovered AZD4320, which has nanomolar affinity for Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, and mechanistically drives cell death through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. AZD4320 demonstrates activity in both Bcl-2- and Bcl-xL-dependent hematologic cancer cell lines and enhanced activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples compared with the Bcl-2-selective agent venetoclax. A single intravenous bolus dose of AZD4320 induces tumor regression with transient thrombocytopenia, which recovers in less than a week, suggesting a clinical weekly schedule would enable targeting of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-dependent tumors without incurring dose-limiting thrombocytopenia. AZD4320 demonstrates monotherapy activity in patient-derived AML and venetoclax-resistant xenograft models. CONCLUSIONS: AZD4320 is a potent molecule with manageable thrombocytopenia risk to explore the utility of a dual Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor across a broad range of tumor types with dysregulation of Bcl-2 prosurvival proteins.","['Balachander, Srividya B', 'Criscione, Steven W', 'Byth, Kate F', 'Cidado, Justin', 'Adam, Ammar', 'Lewis, Paula', 'Macintyre, Terry', 'Wen, Shenghua', 'Lawson, Deborah', 'Burke, Kathleen', 'Lubinski, Tristan', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Kurtz, Stephen E', 'McWeeney, Shannon K', 'Varnes, Jeffrey', 'Diebold, R Bruce', 'Gero, Thomas', 'Ioannidis, Stephanos', 'Hennessy, Edward J', 'McCoull, William', 'Saeh, Jamal C', 'Tabatabai, Areya', 'Tavana, Omid', 'Su, Nancy', 'Schuller, Alwin', 'Garnett, Mathew J', 'Jaaks, Patricia', 'Coker, Elizabeth A', 'Gregory, Gareth P', 'Newbold, Andrea', 'Johnstone, Ricky W', 'Gangl, Eric', 'Wild, Martin', 'Zinda, Michael', 'Secrist, J Paul', 'Davies, Barry R', 'Fawell, Stephen E', 'Gibbons, Francis D']","['Balachander SB', 'Criscione SW', 'Byth KF', 'Cidado J', 'Adam A', 'Lewis P', 'Macintyre T', 'Wen S', 'Lawson D', 'Burke K', 'Lubinski T', 'Tyner JW', 'Kurtz SE', 'McWeeney SK', 'Varnes J', 'Diebold RB', 'Gero T', 'Ioannidis S', 'Hennessy EJ', 'McCoull W', 'Saeh JC', 'Tabatabai A', 'Tavana O', 'Su N', 'Schuller A', 'Garnett MJ', 'Jaaks P', 'Coker EA', 'Gregory GP', 'Newbold A', 'Johnstone RW', 'Gangl E', 'Wild M', 'Zinda M', 'Secrist JP', 'Davies BR', 'Fawell SE', 'Gibbons FD']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8974-8511', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1748-4438', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4841-0917', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2133-0960', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2977-1744', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8401-4546', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2618-4237', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0041-4313', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4934-8887', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4170-0682', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1606-1740']","['Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Translational Science, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Ashland, Oregon.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Ashland, Oregon.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Ashland, Oregon.', 'Chemistry, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Chemistry, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Chemistry, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Chemistry, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Chemistry, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Chemistry, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Chemistry, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Discovery Sciences, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom.', 'School of Clinical Sciences at Monash Health, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'DMPK, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'DMPK, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Bioscience, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Projects, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Cambridge, United Kingdom.

However, there is no report about childhood ALL. Thus, this study aimed at examining the role of MMP-9 rs3918242 genotypes in childhood ALL risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 266 childhood ALL cases and 266 healthy controls in Taiwan were examined for their MMP-9 rs3918242 genotypes via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology. RESULTS: The MMP-9 rs3918242 CT or TT genotype carriers only had a slightly increased risk compared with CC carriers (p=0.6386 and 0.6005, respectively). The allelic frequency analysis also supported the idea that the variant T allele at MMP-9 rs3918242 is not differentially distributed between the case and control groups (p=0.4834). CONCLUSION: MMP-9 rs3918242 genotypes may indirectly influence the risk of childhood ALL. Further validations in other populations and analysis of the detail mechanisms are needed.","['Kuo, Chien-Chung', 'Tsai, Chia-Wen', 'Chang, Wen-Shin', 'Shen, Te-Chun', 'Tzeng, Huey-En', 'Li, Chia-Hsiang', 'Wang, Yun-Chi', 'Tsai, Fuu-Jen', 'Bau, DA-Tian']","['Kuo CC', 'Tsai CW', 'Chang WS', 'Shen TC', 'Tzeng HE', 'Li CH', 'Wang YC', 'Tsai FJ', 'Bau DT']",,"['Department of Pediatric Orthopedics, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Ph.D. Program for Cancer Molecular Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C. datian@mail.cmuh.org.tw artbau2@gmail.com.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,['EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Child', 'Female', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'MMP-9', 'Taiwan', 'case-control study', 'childhood', 'genotype', 'polymorphism']",2020/09/30 06:00,2020/10/08 06:00,['2020/09/29 05:31'],"['2020/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/29 05:31 [entrez]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['40/10/5751 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.14591 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2020 Oct;40(10):5751-5756. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.14591.,"['Copyright(c) 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell acquisition of abnormalities in vital cellular processes, when coupled with intrinsic factors such as germline predisposition or extrinsic factors such as the marrow microenvironment or environmental agents, can lead to requisite pre-leukemic clonal selection, expansion and evolution. Several of these entities have been invoked as ""leukemogens."" The known leukemogens are numerous and are found in the therapeutic, occupational and ambient environments, however they are often difficult to implicate for individual patients. Patients treated with particular chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy accept a calculated risk of therapy-related AML. Occupational exposures to benzene, dioxins, formaldehyde, electromagnetic and particle radiation have been associated with an increased risk of AML. Although regulatory agencies have established acceptable exposure limits in the workplace, accidental exposures and even ambient exposures to leukemogens are possible. It is plausible that inescapable exposure to non-anthropogenic ambient leukemogens may be responsible for many cases of non-inherited de novo AML. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of leukemogens as they relate to AML, assess to what extent the term ""de novo"" leukemia is meaningful, and describe the potential to identify and characterize new leukemogens.","['Shallis, Rory M', 'Weiss, Julian J', 'Deziel, Nicole C', 'Gore, Steven D']","['Shallis RM', 'Weiss JJ', 'Deziel NC', 'Gore SD']",,"['Section of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, USA.

In the post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) setting, the reported incidence has been 10-15%, with severe VOD historically resulting in high mortality rates. Novel agents including calicheamicin conjugated with CD33 (gemtuzumab ozogamicin; GO) and CD22 (inotuzumab ozogamicin; InO) are increasingly used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively.

Expression of a CAR in T cells allows redirection of their natural cytolytic activity toward cells presenting a specific designated surface antigen. Although CAR T cell therapies have thus far shown promising results mostly in B cell malignancy trials, interest in their potential to treat other diseases is on the rise, including using CAR T cells to control human immunodeficiency virus infection. The assessment of CAR T cell potency toward specific targets in vitro is a critical preclinical step. In this study, we describe novel assays that monitor the cytotoxicity of candidate CAR T cells toward simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infected CD4 T cells. The assays involve live cell imaging using a fluorescence microscopy system that records in real time the disappearance or appearance of targets infected with SIV carrying a fluorescent protein gene. The assays are highly reproducible, and their rapid turn around and reduced cost present a significant advance regarding the efficient preclinical evaluation of CAR T cell constructs and are broadly applicable to potential human diseases that could benefit from CAR T cell therapy.","['Haeseleer, Francoise', 'Eichholz, Karsten', 'Tareen, Semih U', 'Iwamoto, Nami', 'Roederer, Mario', 'Kirchhoff, Frank', 'Park, Haesun', 'Okoye, Afam A', 'Corey, Lawrence']","['Haeseleer F', 'Eichholz K', 'Tareen SU', 'Iwamoto N', 'Roederer M', 'Kirchhoff F', 'Park H', 'Okoye AA', 'Corey L']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Juno Therapeutics, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute and Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Beaverton, Oregon, USA.', 'Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute and Oregon National Primate Research Center, Oregon Health & Science University, Beaverton, Oregon, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201105,United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', '*HIV Infections', 'Humans', '*Receptors, Chimeric Antigen', '*Simian Immunodeficiency Virus']",PMC7703091,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T cell', '*cytotoxicity', '*fluorescent proteins', '*immunodeficiency virus', '*real-time']",2020/09/30 06:00,2021/07/31 06:00,['2020/09/29 05:24'],"['2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/29 05:24 [entrez]']",['10.1089/AID.2020.0163 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2020 Dec;36(12):998-1009. doi: 10.1089/AID.2020.0163.

The discovery of leukemic CSCs prompted further identification of CSCs in multiple types of solid tumor. Recently, extensive research has attempted to identity CSCs in multiple types of solid tumors in the brain, colon, head and neck, liver, and lung. Based on these studies, we hypothesize that the initiation and progression of most malignant tumors rely largely on the CSC population. Recent studies indicated that stem cell-related markers or signaling pathways, such as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), CD133, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and Notch signaling, contribute to the initiation and progression of various liver cancer types. Importantly, CSCs are markedly resistant to conventional therapeutic approaches and current targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it is believed that selectively targeting specific markers and/or signaling pathways of hepatic CSCs is an effective therapeutic strategy for treating chemotherapy-resistant liver cancer. Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on the hepatic CSC hypothesis and discuss the specific surface markers and critical signaling pathways involved in the development and maintenance of hepatic CSC subpopulations.","['Lee, Hwa-Yong', 'Hong, In-Sun']","['Lee HY', 'Hong IS']",,"['Department of Biomedical Science, Jungwon University, 85 Goesan-eup, Munmu-ro, Goesan-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do 367700, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, GAIHST, Gachon University, Incheon 21999, Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Gachon University, Incheon 406840, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200924,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7598600,['NOTNLM'],"['ALDH', 'CD133', 'EpCAM', 'Wnt/beta-catenin signaling', 'hepatic cancer stem cells', 'notch signaling']",2020/09/30 06:00,2020/09/30 06:01,['2020/09/29 01:02'],"['2020/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/29 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/30 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12102746 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12102746 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Sep 24;12(10). pii: cancers12102746. doi: 10.3390/cancers12102746.,,['2019-P6713-00/Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Republic of Korea'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous preclinical data from our group demonstrated the anti-myeloma effect of the pan-PIM kinase inhibitor PIM447. METHODS: Based on those data, we evaluate here, by in vitro and in vivo studies, the activity of the triple combination of PIM447 + pomalidomide + dexamethasone (PIM-Pd) in multiple myeloma. RESULTS: Our results show that the PIM-Pd combination exerts a potent anti-myeloma effect in vitro and in vivo, where it markedly delays tumor growth and prolongs survival of treated mice. Mechanism of action studies performed in vitro and on mice tumor samples suggest that the combination PIM-Pd inhibits protein translation processes through the convergent inhibition of c-Myc and mTORC1, which subsequently disrupts the function of eIF4E. Interestingly the MM pro-survival factor IRF4 is also downregulated after PIM-Pd treatment. As a whole, all these molecular changes would promote cell cycle arrest and deregulation of metabolic pathways, including glycolysis and lipid biosynthesis, leading to inhibition of myeloma cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our data support the clinical evaluation of the triple combination PIM-Pd for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma.","['Paino, Teresa', 'Gonzalez-Mendez, Lorena', 'San-Segundo, Laura', 'Corchete, Luis A', 'Hernandez-Garcia, Susana', 'Diaz-Tejedor, Andrea', 'Algarin, Esperanza M', 'Mogollon, Pedro', 'Martin-Sanchez, Montserrat', 'Gutierrez, Norma C', 'Mateos, Maria-Victoria', 'Garayoa, Mercedes', 'Ocio, Enrique M']","['Paino T', 'Gonzalez-Mendez L', 'San-Segundo L', 'Corchete LA', 'Hernandez-Garcia S', 'Diaz-Tejedor A', 'Algarin EM', 'Mogollon P', 'Martin-Sanchez M', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Mateos MV', 'Garayoa M', 'Ocio EM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0201-3572', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2391-5935', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4577-8599', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6108-0986', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2194-2841', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5765-0085']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca), Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca), Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca), Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca), Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC, CB16/12/00233), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca), Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca), Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca), Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca), Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca), Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca), Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC, CB16/12/00233), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca), Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion del Cancer-IBMCC (CSIC-Universidad de Salamanca), Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Salamanca-IBSAL, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla (IDIVAL).

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted including 42 pPCL patients admitted to Peking University People's Hospital from January 1998 to March 2019. All patients were followed up until December 31, 2019. The immunophenotype and cytogenetic characteristics were compared with historical data of multiple myeloma (MM). Thirty-nine patients were divided into bortezomib-based group (29 cases) and non-bortezomib group (10 cases). All patients were also divided into hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) group (15 cases) and non-HSCT group (24 cases).Chi-square test was used for efficacy comparison, and Kaplan-Meier method was used for univariate prognostic analysis. Cox proportional hazards model was used for multi-variant analysis. Results: pPCL accounted for 2.6% of the total patients with plasma cell diseases during the same period. There were 22 males and 20 females, with a median age of 50 (30-77) years old at diagnosis. In immunophenotype analysis, tumor cells in pPCL patients also expressed CD38, CD138, CD45, which was similar as patients with MM. However the expression of CXCR4 were more frequently seen in pPCL(73.1% vs. 34.7%, P= 0.000), while intensity of CD9 and CD200 was lower (40.7% vs. 62.5%, P =0.028, 33.3% vs. 58.0%, P=0.021).Overall response rate of bortezomib-based therapy was superior to non-bortezomib therapy (69.0% vs.50.0%). The median survival was 18.2 (0.2-95.7)months, and the 1-and 2-year survival rates were 61.9% and 37.4%, respectively. Multivariate prognostic analysis suggested that age (P= 0.027) and efficacy(P= 0.035)were significantly correlated with survival.HSCT resulted in superior survival compared with chemotherapy alone(26.8 vs. 8.1 months, P=0.021). Conclusions: Immunophenotypes and cytogenetic abnormalities in patients with pPCL are different from those with multiple myeloma. Bortezomib based regimens improve response rate and survival of pPCL. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation also predicts survival benefits.","['Li, W J', 'Wang, F R', 'Wen, L', 'Chen, Y', 'Chen, H', 'Huang, X J', 'Lu, J']","['Li WJ', 'Wang FR', 'Wen L', 'Chen Y', 'Chen H', 'Huang XJ', 'Lu J']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China; Hematology Collaborative Innovation Center, Suzhou 215006, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,['69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bortezomib/*therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bortezomib', 'Cytogenetics', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, plasma cell']",2020/09/29 06:00,2020/12/31 06:00,['2020/09/28 20:50'],"['2020/09/28 20:50 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn112138-20200306-00201 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2020 Oct 1;59(10):801-806. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112138-20200306-00201.,,['91853202/Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Univariate analysis showed that between ALL with CTBI group (14 cases) and ALL without invasive fungal disease (IFD) group (28 cases), the differences in variables such as ALL not in remission (chi(2)=37.847, P<0.01), length of hospital stay>15 days (chi(2)=8.351, P=0.004), neutropenia (chi(2)=14.280, P<0.01), neutropenia duration>10 days (chi(2)=10.254, P=0.001), use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (chi(2)=13.888, P<0.01), skin and mucous membrane damage (chi(2)= 5.923, P=0.015) were statistically significant. Conclusions: In childhood ALL complicated with tropical candidemia, the drug resistance rate and mortality rate were high. For azole-resistant tropical candida, amphotericin B liposome or echinocandins(caspofungin) -fluorocytosine combined therapy was recommended to reduce treatment-related deaths.","['Yan, L', 'Zheng, M C', 'Ju, X L', 'Hu, S Y', 'Jin, R M', 'Guo, B Y', 'Yang, M H']","['Yan L', 'Zheng MC', 'Ju XL', 'Hu SY', 'Jin RM', 'Guo BY', 'Yang MH']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Hunan Provincial Children's Hospital, Changsha 410007, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, Suzhou 215000, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen 361000, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410013, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Candida', '*Candidemia/complications/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Candida tropicalis', 'Child', 'Fungi', 'Leukemia']",2020/09/29 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/09/28 20:50'],"['2020/09/28 20:50 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20200323-00298 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2020 Oct 2;58(10):813-817. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20200323-00298.,,['81974000/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The data of 29 children diagnosed as MPAL in the Pediatric Blood Disease Center, Institute of Hematology & Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 1, 2005 to December 1, 2019 were collected retrospectively. The morphology, immunophenotypes, cytogenetics, molecular biological characteristics, induction chemotherapy regimen, and prognosis were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier Method was used to draw survival curve. Log-Rank was used for univariate analysis. Results: (1) Among 29 MPAL cases, there were 1 case with KMT2A rearrangement, 1 case with BCR-ABL1, 13 cases with B/myeloid(B-M) type, 12 cases with T/myeloid(T-M) type and 2 cases with acute undifferentiated leukemia. (2) The common immunophenotypes were CD33 (23 cases, 79%), CD34 (25 cases, 86%) and HLA-DR (20 cases, 69%), and CD19 was positive in 17 cases (59%). (3) In molecular genetics analysis, 8 cases were detected to have abnormal gene fusion, including 1 case with MLL-AF4 fusion gene, 1 case with BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, 3 cases with TEL-AML1 fusion gene, 2 cases with WT1 and 1 case with FLT3-ITD. (4) In cytogenetics analysis, 27 cases obtained chromosome karyotypes, including 14 cases with abnormal karyotypes and 10 cases were complex karyotypes. (5) In treatment efficacy analysis, 27 cases received induction chemotherapy and the complete remission(CR) rate was 85%23/27.The 5-year disease free survival(DFS) rate was (71+/-10)% and 5-year overall survival(OS) rate was (74+/-10)%. Thirteen of 14 cases received acute lymphoblastic leukemiaALL induction therapy achieved CR, while 10 of 12 cases received hybrid induction therapy achieved CR. No significant difference was found in 5 year-OS rates between cases with ALL induction therapy and hybrid induction therapy ((77+/-15)% vs. (80+/-13)%, chi(2)=0.027P=0.870). Conclusions: MPAL is a rare childhood leukemia and is prone to incorporate complex karyotypes.

Methods: A total of 239 children who completed their chemotherapy and (or) HSCT and visited the vaccination clinic of Shanghai Children's Medical Center from March 2017 to July 2019 were enrolled in this study. According to the previous diseases, patients were divided into leukemia group (85 cases), lymphoma group (30 cases), solid tumor group (49 cases) and non-malignant hematological disease group (75 cases). According to the treatment of previous diseases, the patients were divided into chemotherapy group (126 cases), HSCT group (89 cases) and chemotherapy plus HSCT group (24 cases). HBsAb titers were assessed both at the time of diagnosis and after completion of treatment and some children who were HBsAb seronegative were re-vaccinated with 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine, the vaccine-related adverse reactions were monitored. HBsAb titers were measured again one month after the completion of inoculation. HBsAb titers were defined as negative at levels <10 U/L and positive at >/= 10 U/L. Chi-square test or Fisher exact test was used to compare the difference of negative conversion rate of hepatitis B antibody between groups, and Logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors of hepatitis B antibody negative conversion. Results: Among 239 patients, there were 143 males and 96 females. At the time of diagnosis, 179 patients (74.9%) were HBsAb seropositive and 60 patients (25.1%) were HBsAb seronegative. After completion of chemotherapy and (or) HSCT, 133 of 179 children with HBsAb seropositive (74.3%) at diagnosis became HBsAb seronegative. Univariate analysis showed significant differences at the negative conversion rates of HBsAb between different disease groups (chi(2)=10.211P=0.015), different treatments groups (chi(2)=14.899P<0.01) and different HBsAb titers groups before treatment (chi(2)=32.117P<0.01). Logistic regression showed that HSCT (chemotherapy group as the reference, odds ratio (OR=2.999, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.276-7.050P=0.012) and HBsAb titers<328.2 U/L before treatment (HBsAb titers>/=328.2 U/L group as the reference, OR=6.397 95% CI3.159-12.954P<0.01) were risk factors for negative conversion of HBsAb. Among 48 patients whose HBsAb was seronegative after completion of chemotherapy and (or) HSCT and re-vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, 47 (97.9%) cases became HBsAb seropositivie. No serious adverse effects or complications were reported among these patients. Conclusions: After completion of chemotherapy and (or) HSCT, most children completely lose their protective humoral immunity against hepatitis B. Hepatitis B re-vaccination schedule can be efficiently and safely applied in those patients.","['Yuan, Q', 'Zhou, F', 'Zhang, H', 'Cao, Q', 'Chen, W J', 'Fei, Y', 'Luo, C Y', 'Gao, Y J']","['Yuan Q', 'Zhou F', 'Zhang H', 'Cao Q', 'Chen WJ', 'Fei Y', 'Luo CY', 'Gao YJ']",,"[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 20027, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 20027, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 20027, China."", ""Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 0017, China."", ""Department of Infectious Disease, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 0017, China."", 'Center for Diseases Control and Prevention of Pudong New District, Shanghai 20016, China.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 20027, China."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 20027, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hepatitis B Antibodies)', '0 (Hepatitis B Vaccines)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Child', 'China', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', '*Hepatitis B/prevention & control', 'Hepatitis B Antibodies', '*Hepatitis B Vaccines/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Vaccination']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Child', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Hepatitis B', 'Immunity']",2020/09/29 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/09/28 20:50'],"['2020/09/28 20:50 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20200307-00195 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2020 Oct 2;58(10):802-806. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn112140-20200307-00195.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impact of the composition regarding different cell subsets in the development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is not fully understood. We performed a cell subsets analysis of 56 DLIs from fully HLA-compatible identical matched sibling donors (MSDs) in 36 alloHCT patients and studied its association with GVHD. A median of one DLI was infused per patient. Fourteen patients (38%) developed GVHD. The cell composition analysis of the first DLI (DLI1) showed that a high dose of B cells (P = .03) and CD27(+) B cells (P < .01) was associated with GVHD. We identified DLI dose cutoff points for several cell populations above which GVHD was more frequent (CD8(+) TN >3 x 10(6) cells/kg, CD27(+) B cells >2.6 x 10(6)/kg, CD27(+) NK >0.35 x 10(6) cells/kg, and mononuclear cells >0.83 x 10(8)/kg). Noteworthy, the proportion of CD4(+) naive T cells (TN) or unselected TN was not linked with GVHD and a DLI1 containing a higher dose of regulatory T cells was not protective for GVHD. We studied several transplant clinical variables and did not find any association with GVHD. Altogether, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the cell populations in a DLI from MSDs and identifies potential key cell subsets, which provides insight for the understanding of GVHD after DLI.","['Orti, Guillermo', 'Palacio-Garcia, Carles', 'Garcia-Cadenas, Irene', 'Sanchez-Ortega, Isabel', 'Jimenez, Maria Jose', 'Azqueta, Carmen', 'Villacampa, Guillermo', 'Ferra, Christelle', 'Parody, Rocio', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Bosch, Francesc', 'Querol, Sergi', 'Valcarcel, David']","['Orti G', 'Palacio-Garcia C', 'Garcia-Cadenas I', 'Sanchez-Ortega I', 'Jimenez MJ', 'Azqueta C', 'Villacampa G', 'Ferra C', 'Parody R', 'Martino R', 'Bosch F', 'Querol S', 'Valcarcel D']",,"[""Departament de Medicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO), Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain.

A prospective cohort study.,553-564,10.3233/CBM-201790 [doi],"BACKGROUND AND AIM: There is a limited data at the moment regarding the clinical value of inflammatory indices and malnutrition markers in children with acute leukemias. We have examined the usefulness of prognostic nutritional index (PNI), Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), Prognostic Index (PI), monocyte to lymphocyte (MLR), neutrophil to lymphocyte (NLR), and platelet to lymphocyte (PLR) ratios to stratify patients as regards the response to induction therapy correlating them to different prognostic factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with acute leukemia and without microbial-induced inflammation at the time of diagnosis were prospectively recruited. Preliminary total and differential CBC, c-reactive protein (CRP), serum albumin (ALB) were used to calculate different inflammatory indicators including NLR, MLR, PLR, PNI, GPS, and PI. RESULTS: Higher PNI was significantly more associated to children who achieved remission as compared to those without remission (p< 0.0001). Patients without remission had GPS 1 or 2 compared to GPS 0 or 1 in those who entered remission (p= 0.001). NLR was significantly lower in patients in remission than in those without remission (p= 0.005). Similarly, complete remission was significantly associated to MLR 0.45 as compared to MLR > 0.45 (p< 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Pretreatment PNI, GPS, CRP, serum albumin, NLR, MLR, and PLR are remission promising prognostic markers in pediatric acute leukemias, which deserve to be further investigated in large-scale studies.","['Zahran, Asmaa M', 'Riad, Khalid F', 'Elsayh, Khalid I', 'Elmasry, Heba M', 'Rayan, Amal']","['Zahran AM', 'Riad KF', 'Elsayh KI', 'Elmasry HM', 'Rayan A']",,"['Clinical Pathology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Department, Assiut University Hospital, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Clinical Oncology Department, Assiut University Hospital, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'AML', 'Glasgow prognostic score', 'Prognostic nutritional index', 'monocyte to lymphocyte', 'neutrophil to lymphocyte', 'platelet to lymphocyte ratios', 'prognostic index']",2020/09/29 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2020/09/28 17:11'],"['2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/28 17:11 [entrez]']","['CBM201790 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-201790 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2020;29(4):553-564. doi: 10.3233/CBM-201790.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mcl-1, a member of the Bcl-2 family, plays a crucial role in regulation of cell apoptosis. Aberrant expression of HSP10, HSP60 and Mcl-1 is involved in the development of many tumors. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between expression of HSP10, HSP60 and Mcl-1 and clinicopathological features of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Tissue microarrays including 53 non-cancerous lung tissues (Non-CLT) and 354 surgically resected NSCLC were stained with anti-HSP10, anti-HSP60 and anti-Mcl-1 antibodies respectively by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Higher expression of HSP10, HSP60 and Mcl-1 was found in NSCLC compared with Non-CLT. Both individual and combined HSP10 and HSP60 expression in patients with clinical stage III was higher than that in stage I approximately II. Expression of HSP10 showed a positive correlation with HSP60 and Mcl-1. Overall survival time of NSCLC patients was remarkably shorter with elevated expression of HSP10, HSP60 and Mcl-1 alone and in combination. Moreover overexpression of HSP10 and Mcl-1 was poor independent prognostic factor for lung adenocarcinoma patients. CONCLUSIONS: High expression of HSP10, HSP60 and Mcl-1 might act as novel biomarker of poor prognosis for NSCLC patients.","['Tang, Yaoxiang', 'Yang, Yang', 'Luo, Jiadi', 'Liu, Sile', 'Zhan, Yuting', 'Zang, Hongjing', 'Zheng, Hongmei', 'Zhang, Yuting', 'Feng, Juan', 'Fan, Songqing', 'Wen, Qiuyuan']","['Tang Y', 'Yang Y', 'Luo J', 'Liu S', 'Zhan Y', 'Zang H', 'Zheng H', 'Zhang Y', 'Feng J', 'Fan S', 'Wen Q']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['0 (Chaperonin 10)', '0 (Chaperonin 60)', '0 (HSPD1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Chaperonin 10/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Chaperonin 60/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC7990427,['NOTNLM'],"['HSP10', 'HSP60', 'Mcl-1', 'NSCLC', 'prognosis']",2020/09/29 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2020/09/28 17:11'],"['2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/28 17:11 [entrez]']","['CBM200410 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-200410 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2021;30(1):85-94. doi: 10.3233/CBM-200410.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CLL were randomly assigned to 2 years of venetoclax (VenR for the first six cycles) or six cycles of BR. PFS, overall survival (OS), peripheral-blood minimal residual disease (MRD) status, genomic complexity (GC), and gene mutations were assessed. RESULTS: Of 389 patients, 194 were assigned to VenR and 195 to BR. Four-year PFS and OS rates were higher with VenR than BR, at 57.3% and 4.6% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.19; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.25), and 85.3% and 66.8% (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.65), respectively. Undetectable MRD (uMRD) at end of combination therapy (EOCT) was associated with superior PFS compared with low MRD positivity (HR, 0.50) and high MRD positivity (HR, 0.15). Patients in the VenR arm who received ibrutinib as their first therapy after progression (n = 12) had a reported response rate of 100% (10 of 10 evaluable patients); patients subsequently treated with a venetoclax-based regimen (n = 14) had a reported response rate of 55% (six of 11 evaluable patients). With VenR, the uMRD rate at end of treatment (EOT) was lower in patients with GC than in those without GC (P = .042); higher GC was associated with shorter PFS. Higher MRD positivity rates were seen with BIRC3 and BRAF mutations at EOCT and with TP53, NOTCH1, XPO1, and BRAF mutations at EOT. CONCLUSION: Efficacy benefits with fixed-duration VenR are sustained and particularly durable in patients who achieve uMRD. Salvage therapy with ibrutinib after VenR achieved high response rates. Genetic mutations and GC affected MRD rates and PFS.","['Kater, Arnon P', 'Wu, Jenny Qun', 'Kipps, Thomas', 'Eichhorst, Barbara', 'Hillmen, Peter', ""D'Rozario, James"", 'Assouline, Sarit', 'Owen,

Stress on the family can cause the formation of negative communication in children so that families tend to spend more time in dealing with negative emotions through negative actions. This study aimed to analyze the correlation between stress, anxiety, and depression in caregiver with pediatric ALL outcome. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted on children with ALL and their caregivers at the Pediatric Ward, Dr. Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya. Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaire were used to measure anxiety and depression in caregivers. Previous stressful experiences in children and caregivers were assessed by The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Children quality of life was assessed by pediatric quality of life inventory (PedsQL) questionnaire. Pearson and Spearman correlation strength test was performed for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: There is no significant correlation between stress level of caregivers with the quality of life of children with ALL (P > 0.05). There is negative correlation between the level of anxiety and depression in caregivers with the quality of life of children (P < 0.05). There is negative correlation between children stress level with the quality of life of children (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The psychological condition of the caregiver affects the quality of life of children. The higher the level of anxiety and depression in caregivers, the lower the quality of life of children.<br />.","['Irwanto, -', 'Ratwita, Mia', 'Prihaningtyas, Rendi Aji', 'Mustakim, Muhammad Rizki Darmawan']","['Irwanto -', 'Ratwita M', 'Prihaningtyas RA', 'Mustakim MRD']",['ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0002-7573-8793'],"['Department of Child Health, Faculty of Medicine Universitas Airlangga/Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia.', 'Department of Child Health, Faculty of Medicine Universitas Airlangga/Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia.', 'Department of Child Health, Faculty of Medicine Universitas Airlangga/Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia.', 'Department of Child Health, Faculty of Medicine Universitas Airlangga/Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200901,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety/*epidemiology', 'Caregivers/*psychology', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Depression/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Indonesia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', '*Quality of Life', 'Stress, Psychological/*epidemiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",PMC7779437,['NOTNLM'],"['Anxiety', 'Leukemia', 'Stress', 'children', 'depression']",2020/09/29 06:00,2021/06/12 06:00,['2020/09/28 15:24'],"['2020/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/28 15:24 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.9.2683 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Sep 1;21(9):2683-2688. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.9.2683.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tim-3 is a co-inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor expressed on exhausted T-cells during tumor progression. Fyn and Bat3 are two important adaptor molecules involved in inhibition and activation of Tim-3 downstream signaling, respectively. In this study, the expression of Tim-3, Fyn, and Bat3 mRNA was evaluated in CLL patients. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 54 patients with CLL and 34 healthy controls. Total RNA was extracted from all samples and applied for cDNA synthesis. The relative expression of Tim-3, Fyn, and Bat3 mRNA was determined by TaqMan Real-Time PCR using GAPDH as an internal control. RESULTS: Tim-3 mRNA expression was not significantly different between CLL patients and healthy controls. Fyn mRNA expression was significantly lower in CLL patients and conversely, Bat3 mRNA expression was higher in CLL patients compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, the mRNA expression of Fyn inhibitory adaptor molecule was remarkably associated with expression of Tim-3 in CLL patients. CONCLUSION: We have highlighted for the first time the expression of Fyn and Bat3 adaptor molecules in CLL patients. Our data demonstrated the strong correlation between the expression of Tim-3 and Fyn inhibitory molecules in CLL implying an important role for Tim-3-Fyn cooperation in induction of T-cell exhaustion.","['Hosseini-Valiki, Fereshteh', 'Taghiloo, Saeid', 'Tavakolian, Golvash', 'Amjadi, Omolbanin', 'Tehrani, Mohsen', 'Hedayatizadeh-Omran, Akbar', 'Alizadeh-Navaei, Reza', 'Zaboli, Ehsan', 'Shekarriz, Ramin', 'Asgarian-Omran, Hossein']","['Hosseini-Valiki F', 'Taghiloo S', 'Tavakolian G', 'Amjadi O', 'Tehrani M', 'Hedayatizadeh-Omran A', 'Alizadeh-Navaei R', 'Zaboli E', 'Shekarriz R', 'Asgarian-Omran H']",,"['Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, Non-Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, Non-Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, Non-Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, Non-Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, Non-Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, Non-Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, Non-Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Imam Khomeini Hospital, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, Non-Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Imam Khomeini Hospital, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, Non-Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200901,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (BAG6 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC7779459,['NOTNLM'],"['Bat3', 'Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Fyn', 'TIM-3', 'exhausted T-cell']",2020/09/29 06:00,2021/06/12 06:00,['2020/09/28 15:24'],"['2020/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/28 15:24 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.9.2615 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Sep 1;21(9):2615-2621. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.9.2615.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is commonly used in children with MDS with excess blasts and in patients with refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC) associated with monosomy 7, complex karyotype, severe neutropenia, or transfusion dependence. We recruited 27 children with MDS who received haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT). At transplantation, 10 patients had RCC, 12 patients had advanced MDS (RAEB and RAEB-T), and 5 patients had myelodysplasia-related acute myeloid leukemia (MDR-AML). All patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized bone marrow cells and peripheral blood stem cells. At a median follow-up of 24.1 months (range: 2.0-74.5 months) after HSCT, the estimated probabilities of 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were both 81.9% (95% CI, 66.8-100.0%). The estimated 3-year incidences of relapse (CIR) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were both 7.4% (95% CI, 1.2%-21.4%). The 100-day cumulative incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD was 52.6% (95% CI, 42.9-62.3%), while that of grade III-IV aGVHD was 11.1% (95% CI, 5.1-17.1%). The 3-year cumulative incidences of overall and extensive cGVHD were 42.3% (95% CI, 19.8%-57.5%) and 21.1% (95% CI, 2.5%-63.2%), respectively. Univariate analysis showed that chronic GVHD significantly affected OS and DFS. Haploidentical HSCT may be an effective treatment option with easier donor availability for pediatric patients with MDS.","['Suo, Pan', 'Wang, Shasha', 'Xue, Yujuan', 'Cheng, Yifei', 'Kong, Jun',

CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old woman with chronic-phase CML who showed resistance/intolerance to pre-TKIs has been treated with ponatinib. A high ponatinib bioavailability was noted; therefore, we administered ponatinib 15 mg/3 d to avoid adverse events due to high exposure. Eventually, the patient achieved a major molecular response. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Monitoring of the ponatinib plasma concentration led to safe and effective CML management in a patient with higher drug bioavailability.","['Abumiya, Maiko', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Yoshioka, Tomoko', 'Kameoka, Yoshihiro', 'Miura, Masatomo']","['Abumiya M', 'Takahashi N', 'Yoshioka T', 'Kameoka Y', 'Miura M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6758-3787', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7120-2425']","['Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nephrology, and Rheumatology, Akita University Graduate School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Promotion and Support Center, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200928,England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Pyridazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['bioavailability', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'intolerance', 'plasma concentrations', 'ponatinib']",2020/09/29 06:00,2021/09/07 06:00,['2020/09/28 08:46'],"['2020/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/28 08:46 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcpt.13257 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2021 Feb;46(1):219-222. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.13257.

Here, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor effects of the FDA-approved ETAR antagonist, Ambrisentan, which is currently used to treat patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. In vitro, Ambrisentan inhibited both spontaneous and induced migration/invasion capacity of different tumor cells (COLO-357 metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, OvCar3 ovarian carcinoma, MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma, and HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia). Whole transcriptome analysis using RNAseq indicated Ambrisentan's inhibitory effects on the whole transcriptome of resting and PAR2-activated COLO-357 cells, which tended to normalize to an unstimulated profile. Finally, in a pre-clinical murine model of metastatic breast cancer, treatment with Ambrisentan was effective in decreasing metastasis into the lungs and liver. Importantly, this was associated with a significant enhancement in animal survival. Taken together, our work suggests a new therapeutic application for Ambrisentan in the treatment of cancer metastasis.","['Kappes, Lucy', 'Amer, Ruba L', 'Sommerlatte, Sabine', 'Bashir, Ghada',

Furthermore, overexpression of Dlx5 was sufficient to drive T-ALL in mice by directly activating Akt and Notch signaling. These findings implied that Akt2 cooperates with Dlx5 in T-cell lymphomagenesis. To test this hypothesis, Lck-Dlx5;Lck-MyrAkt2 transgenic mice were generated. MyrAkt2 synergized with Dlx5 to greatly accelerate and enhance the dissemination of T-lymphomagenesis. RNA-seq analysis performed on lymphomas from Lck-Dlx5;Lck-MyrAkt mice revealed upregulation of genes involved in the Wnt and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways. Combined RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis of lymphomas from Lck-Dlx5;Lck-MyrAkt mice demonstrated that beta-catenin directly regulates genes involved in sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2 (Srebf2)-cholesterol synthesis. These lymphoma cells had high Lef1 levels and were highly sensitive to beta-catenin and Srebf2-cholesterol synthesis inhibitors. Similarly, human T-ALL cell lines with activated NOTCH and AKT and elevated LEF1 levels were sensitive to inhibition of beta-catenin and cholesterol pathways. Furthermore, LEF1 expression positively correlated with expression of genes involved in the cholesterol synthesis pathway in primary human T-ALL specimens. Together, these data suggest that targeting beta-catenin and/or cholesterol biosynthesis, together with AKT, could have therapeutic efficacy in a subset of T-ALL patients.","['Tan, Yinfei', 'Sementino, Eleonora', 'Liu, Zemin', 'Cai, Kathy Q', 'Testa, Joseph R']","['Tan Y', 'Sementino E', 'Liu Z', 'Cai KQ', 'Testa JR']",,"['Cancer Biology Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA, 19111, USA.

CML is now managed as a chronic disease requiring both long-term treatment and close molecular monitoring in the majority of patients. AREAS COVERED: Evidence suggests that in a substantial number of patients who have achieved a stable deep molecular response (DMR), TKI treatment can be safely discontinued without loss of response. Therefore, treatment-free remission (TFR), through the achievement of a DMR, is increasingly regarded as a feasible treatment goal in about 20% to 40% CML patients. Nevertheless, a proportion of patients with chronic-phase CML treated with TKIs remain in stable MMR and do not achieve a DMR. EXPERT OPINION: We provide prospective views on how it is possible to optimize treatment for patients in stable MMR but not in DMR in order to finalize the therapeutic strategy.","['Stagno, Fabio', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco']","['Stagno F', 'Breccia M', 'Di Raimondo F']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7947-158X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1163-6162']","['Hematology Section and BMT Unit, Rodolico Hospital, AOU Policlinico - V.

This study aims to estimate population-based indicators of cancer cure in Europe by type, sex, age and period. METHODS: 7.2 million cancer patients (42 population-based cancer registries in 17 European countries) diagnosed at ages 15-74 years in 1990-2007 with follow-up to 2008 were selected from the EUROCARE-5 dataset. Mixture-cure models were used to estimate: (i) life expectancy of fatal cases (LEF); (ii) cure fraction (CF) as proportion of patients with same death rates as the general population; (iii) time to cure (TTC) as time to reach 5-year conditional relative survival (CRS) >95%. RESULTS: LEF ranged from 10 years for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients to <6 months for those with liver, pancreas, brain, gallbladder and lung cancers. It was 7.7 years for patients with prostate cancer at age 65-74 years and >5 years for women with breast cancer. The CF was 94% for testis, 87% for thyroid cancer in women and 70% in men, 86% for skin melanoma in women and 76% in men, 66% for breast, 63% for prostate and <10% for liver, lung and pancreatic cancers. TTC was <5 years for testis and thyroid cancer patients diagnosed below age 55 years, and <10 years for stomach, colorectal, corpus uteri and melanoma patients of all ages. For breast and prostate cancers, a small excess (CRS < 95%) remained for at least 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: Estimates from this analysis should help to reduce unneeded medicalization and costs. They represent an opportunity to improve patients' quality of life.","['Dal Maso, Luigino', 'Panato, Chiara', 'Tavilla, Andrea', 'Guzzinati, Stefano', 'Serraino, Diego', 'Mallone, Sandra', 'Botta, Laura', 'Boussari, Olayide', 'Capocaccia, Riccardo', 'Colonna, Marc', 'Crocetti, Emanuele', 'Dumas, Agnes', 'Dyba, Tadek', 'Franceschi, Silvia', 'Gatta, Gemma', 'Gigli, Anna', 'Giusti, Francesco', 'Jooste, Valerie', 'Minicozzi, Pamela', 'Neamtiu, Luciana', 'Romain, Gaelle', 'Zorzi, Manuel', 'De Angelis, Roberta', 'Francisci, Silvia']","['Dal Maso L', 'Panato C', 'Tavilla A', 'Guzzinati S', 'Serraino D', 'Mallone S', 'Botta L', 'Boussari O', 'Capocaccia R', 'Colonna M', 'Crocetti E', 'Dumas A', 'Dyba T', 'Franceschi S', 'Gatta G', 'Gigli A', 'Giusti F', 'Jooste V', 'Minicozzi P', 'Neamtiu L', 'Romain G', 'Zorzi M', 'De Angelis R', 'Francisci S']",,"['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', 'National Center for Prevention and Health Promotion, Italian National Institute of Health (ISS), Rome, Italy.', 'Veneto Tumour Registry, Azienda Zero, Padua, Italy.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', 'National Center for Prevention and Health Promotion, Italian National Institute of Health (ISS), Rome, Italy.', 'Evaluative Epidemiology Unit, Research Department, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Registre Bourguignon des Cancers Digestifs, INSERM UMR 1231, CHU de Dijon, Universite de Bourgogne, Dijon, France.', 'Editorial Board, Epidemiologia & Prevenzione, Milan, Italy.', ""Registre du Cancer de l'Isere, Grenoble, France."", 'Romagna Cancer Registry, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), IRCCS, Meldola, ItalyAzienda Usl della Romagna, Forli, Italy.', 'National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM), Paris, France.', 'European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Ispra, Italy.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico (CRO), IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', 'Evaluative Epidemiology Unit, Research Department, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Institute for Research on Population and Social Policies, National Research Council, Rome, Italy.', 'European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Ispra, Italy.', 'Registre Bourguignon des Cancers Digestifs, INSERM UMR 1231, CHU de Dijon, Universite de Bourgogne, Dijon, France.', 'Analytical Epidemiology and Health Impact Unit, Research Department, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Cancer Survival Group, Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Ispra, Italy.', 'Registre Bourguignon des Cancers Digestifs, INSERM UMR 1231, CHU de Dijon, Universite de Bourgogne, Dijon, France.', 'Veneto Tumour Registry, Azienda Zero, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Italian National Institute of Health (ISS), Rome, Italy.', 'National Center for Prevention and Health Promotion, Italian National Institute of Health (ISS), Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Life Expectancy', 'Male', '*Melanoma', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms/epidemiology/therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Registries', '*Skin Neoplasms', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer cure', '*Europe', '*life expectancy', '*mixture cure models', '*population-based cancer registries', '*survival', '*time to cure']",2020/09/29 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/09/28 05:48'],"['2020/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/28 05:48 [entrez]']","['5912108 [pii]', '10.1093/ije/dyaa128 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 2020 Oct 1;49(5):1517-1525. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyaa128.,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020; all rights reserved.

However, there are some leukemic entities that may mimic aspects of the clinical and/or laboratory picture of APL and cause confusion because of karyotype nomenclature. Therefore, recognition of such entities may be of therapeutic and prognostic significance. METHODS: We present 2 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(11;17) that were clinically concerning for APL based primarily on clinical presentation but were ultimately diagnosed as AML with monocytic differentiation. RESULTS: Both leukemias harbored KMT2A translocations, one located near but not involving RARA and the other with SEPT9. CONCLUSION: In leukemias that clinically and/or immunophenotypically mimic APL, identification of specific gene translocations can lead to the correct diagnosis and may carry therapeutic/prognostic implications.","['Balbuena-Merle, Raisa I', 'Tormey, Christopher A', 'DiAdamo, Autumn', 'Rinder, Henry M', 'Siddon, Alexa J']","['Balbuena-Merle RI', 'Tormey CA', 'DiAdamo A', 'Rinder HM', 'Siddon AJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2372-3653'],"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Genetics and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Internal Medicine (Hematology), Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Lab Med,Laboratory medicine,0250641,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Tretinoin']",,['NOTNLM'],"['RARA variants', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'fluorescence in situ hybridization', 'genetic sequencing', 'karyotype', 'molecular diagnostics']",2020/09/29 06:00,2021/12/24 06:00,['2020/09/28 05:48'],"['2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/28 05:48 [entrez]']","['5912306 [pii]', '10.1093/labmed/lmaa078 [doi]']",ppublish,Lab Med. 2021 May 4;52(3):290-296. doi: 10.1093/labmed/lmaa078.,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology 2020.

Lenalidomide interacts with cereblon (CRBN), a component of the CRL4(CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of substrates, such as transcription factor Ikaros (Ikaros family zinc finger 1, IKZF1). With a genome loss of function screen, we recently identified two novel pathways mediated by lenalidomide in MDS. In this review, we summarized the major findings of these two pathways and their clinical implications. Depletion of G protein-coupled receptor 68 (GPR68) or an endogenous calcineurin (CaN) inhibitor, regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), reversed the inhibitory effect of lenalidomide on MDSL cells, an MDS cell line. Intriguingly, both GPR68 and RCAN1 expression levels were upregulated in MDSL cells after treatment with lenalidomide that was dependent on diminishment of IKZF1, indicating that IKZF1 functioned as a transcription repressor for GPR68 and RCAN1. Mechanistic studies revealed that upregulation or activation of GPR68 induced a Ca(2+)/calpain pro-apoptotic pathway, while upregulation of RCAN1 inhibited the CaN pro-survival pathway in MDSL cells. Notably, the pharmacological CaN inhibitor, cyclosporine, enhanced the sensitivity to lenalidomide in MDS as well as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Surprisingly, pretreatment with lenalidomide reversed the immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporine on T lymphocytes. Our studies suggest that lenalidomide mediates degradation of IKZF1, leading to derepression of GPR68 and RCAN1 that activates the Ca2+/calpain pro- apoptotic pathway and inhibits the CaN pro-survival pathway, respectively. Our studies implicate that cyclosporine extends the therapeutic potential of lenalidomide to myeloid malignancies without compromising immune function.","['Dou, Aixia', 'Fang, Jing']","['Dou A', 'Fang J']",,"['Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, University of South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Columbia, SC, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, University of South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Columbia, SC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Cell Immunol,Journal of cellular immunology,101757237,,,,PMC7518522,,,2020/09/29 06:00,2020/09/29 06:01,['2020/09/28 05:48'],"['2020/09/28 05:48 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.33696/immunology.2.049 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Immunol. 2020;2(5):237-244. doi: 10.33696/immunology.2.049.,,['R01 CA218076/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Declarations The authors declare that they have no known competing financial', 'interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the', 'work reported in this paper.']",['NIHMS1617156'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neurological deficit developed quickly afterwards. Intracranial infection was suspected clinically. Contrast-enhanced head CT revealed multiple hyperdense lesions and diffuse cerebral oedema. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and leukapheresis was stopped. Intracranial hyperdense lesion in leukemic patients has many differential diagnosis, such as infection, granulocytic sarcoma (chloroma), and hemorrhage.

Aim: To identify the most likely causal gene(s) associated with BP at the 10q24.32 locus using zebrafish as an animal model. Results: We report significantly higher blood flow, increased arterial pulse, and elevated linear velocity in zebrafish larvae with cnnm2 and nt5c2 knocked down using gene-specific splice modification transcriptional morpholinos, compared with controls. No differences in blood-flow parameters were observed after as3mt, borcs7, or cyp17a1 knockdown. There was no effect on vessel diameter in animals with any of the four genes knocked down. At the molecular level, expression of hypertension markers (crp and ace) was significantly increased in cnnm2 and nt5c2 knockdown larvae. Further, the results obtained by morpholino knockdown were validated using zebrafish knockout (KO) lines with cnnm2 and nt5c2 deficiency, again resulting in higher blood flow, increased arterial pulse, and elevated linear velocity. Analysis of nt5c2a KO larvae demonstrated that lack of this gene resulted in reduced expression of cnnm2a, with reciprocal downregulation of nt5c2a in cnnm2a KO larvae. Staining of whole-blood smears from nt5c2 mutants revealed that KO of this gene might be associated with an acute lymphoblastic leukemia phenotype, consistent with literature reports. Additional experiments were designed based on previous literature on cnnm2a mutant zebrafish revealed impaired renal function, high levels of renin, and significantly increased expression of the ren gene, leading us to hypothesize that the observed elevated blood-flow parameters may be attributable to triggering of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone signaling pathway. Conclusion: Our zebrafish data establish CNNM2 and NT5C2 as the most likely causal genes at the 10q24.32 BP locus and indicate that they trigger separate downstream mechanistic pathways.","['Vishnolia, Krishan K', 'Hoene, Celine', 'Tarhbalouti, Karim', 'Revenstorff, Julian', 'Aherrahrou, Zouhair', 'Erdmann, Jeanette']","['Vishnolia KK', 'Hoene C', 'Tarhbalouti K', 'Revenstorff J', 'Aherrahrou Z', 'Erdmann J']",,"['Institute for Cardiogenetics, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'DZHK (German Research Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Hamburg/Luebeck/Kiel, Luebeck, Germany.', 'University Heart Centre Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Institute for Cardiogenetics, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'DZHK (German Research Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Hamburg/Luebeck/Kiel, Luebeck, Germany.', 'University Heart Centre Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Institute for Cardiogenetics, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'DZHK (German Research Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Hamburg/Luebeck/Kiel, Luebeck, Germany.', 'University Heart Centre Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Institute for Cardiogenetics, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'DZHK (German Research Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Hamburg/Luebeck/Kiel, Luebeck, Germany.', 'University Heart Centre Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Institute for Cardiogenetics, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'DZHK (German Research Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Hamburg/Luebeck/Kiel, Luebeck, Germany.', 'University Heart Centre Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Institute for Cardiogenetics, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'DZHK (German Research Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Hamburg/Luebeck/Kiel, Luebeck, Germany.', 'University Heart Centre Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200902,Switzerland,Front Cardiovasc Med,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,101653388,,,,PMC7492806,['NOTNLM'],"['10q24.32 locus', 'GWAS & Post-GWAS', 'blood-pressure', 'nt5c2 & cnnm2', 'zebrafish']",2020/09/29 06:00,2020/09/29 06:01,['2020/09/28 05:46'],"['2020/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/28 05:46 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcvm.2020.00135 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cardiovasc Med. 2020 Sep 2;7:135. doi: 10.3389/fcvm.2020.00135. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Vishnolia, Hoene, Tarhbalouti, Revenstorff, Aherrahrou and', 'Erdmann.']",,,,,['Front Cardiovasc Med. 2020 Oct 19;7:582101.

Biomarkers for earlier diagnosis and improved treatment alternatives are critical. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) can promote the growth and progression of various cancers; however, prostate cancer-specific circRNAs have not been found. We identified circ-0016068, a circRNA that was expressed more strongly in prostate cancer tumors vs. normal paired tissue, and confirmed its relatively high expression in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. We also discerned that circ-0016068 promotes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the growth, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro; and promotes the growth and metastasis of tumors in a mouse model of prostate cancer. Moreover, we found that circ-0016068 competes with the B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 (BMI-1) for binding to miR-330-3p. In so doing, circ-0016068 sequesters miR-330-3p and frees BMI-1 to enhance the proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells, and the metastasis of xenograft tumors. These results suggest that circ-0016068 may be a promising diagnostic biomarker for early stage prostate cancer and a potential target for novel cancer therapeutics.","['Li, Qingyuan', 'Wang, Wei', 'Zhang, Min', 'Sun, Wenguo', 'Shi, Wei', 'Li, Feng']","['Li Q', 'Wang W', 'Zhang M', 'Sun W', 'Shi W', 'Li F']",,"['Department of Urology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Urology, Zibo Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Zibo, China.', ""Department of Urology, Jinan City People's Hospital, Jinan, China."", 'Department of Urology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Urology, Yantai Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China.', 'School of Medicine, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200826,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC7479067,['NOTNLM'],"['BMI-1', 'circ-0016068', 'competing endogenous RNA', 'miR-330-3p', 'prostate cancer']",2020/09/29 06:00,2020/09/29 06:01,['2020/09/28 05:45'],"['2020/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/28 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2020.00827 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2020 Aug 26;8:827. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2020.00827. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Li, Wang, Zhang, Sun, Shi and Li.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the present conventional methodologies partly rely on manual examination, which is time consuming and depends greatly on the experience of domain experts, automated leukemia detection opens up new possibilities to minimize human intervention and provide more accurate clinical information. This paper proposes a novel approach based on conventional digital image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify acute lymphoblastic leukemia from peripheral blood smear images. To overcome the greatest challenges in the segmentation phase, we implemented extensive pre-processing and introduced a three-phase filtration algorithm to achieve the best segmentation results. Moreover, sixteen robust features were extracted from the images in the way that hematological experts do, which significantly increased the capability of the classifiers to recognize leukemic cells in microscopic images. To perform the classification, we applied two traditional machine learning classifiers, the artificial neural network and the support vector machine. Both methods reached a specificity of 95.31%, and the sensitivity of the support vector machine and artificial neural network reached 98.25 and 100%, respectively.","['Bodzas, Alexandra', 'Kodytek, Pavel', 'Zidek, Jan']","['Bodzas A', 'Kodytek P', 'Zidek J']",,"['Department of Cybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, VSB-Technical University of Ostrava, Ostrava, Czechia.', 'Department of Cybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, VSB-Technical University of Ostrava, Ostrava, Czechia.', 'Department of Cybernetics and Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, VSB-Technical University of Ostrava, Ostrava, Czechia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200828,Switzerland,Front Bioeng Biotechnol,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,101632513,,,,PMC7484487,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'automated leukemia detection', 'blood smear image analysis', 'cell segmentation', 'image processing', 'leukemic cell identification', 'machine learning']",2020/09/29 06:00,2020/09/29 06:01,['2020/09/28 05:45'],"['2020/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/28 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fbioe.2020.01005 [doi]'],epublish,Front Bioeng Biotechnol. 2020 Aug 28;8:1005. doi: 10.3389/fbioe.2020.01005. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Bodzas, Kodytek and Zidek.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It may, however, lead to compromised quality of life, or even permanent disability later in life due to osteoporosis, pain or fractures if left untreated. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most frequent childhood malignancy with an over 85% five-year survival. ALL and its treatment cause bone alterations in adults, but little information on the bone health status in juvenile survivors is available. Objective: To report data on skeletal late effects in juvenile survivors of childhood ALL based on a comprehensive assessment of bone health and to assess the influence of a vitamin D deficiency on bone health in this cohort. Methods: In a single center cross sectional study 128 pediatric patients (11.9 +/- 4.76 years) with a mean follow up of 5.88 +/- 3.75 years after diagnosis of ALL were recruited. The bone health status of the survivors was assessed based on clinical examination, review of medical records, biochemical and radiographic analyses, by clinical experts. A score which utilized 8 different parameters was formed and used to assess the effect of a vitamin D deficiency on bone health. Results: In this cohort, 18% of survivors displayed overt osteopathologies as defined by clinical expert assessment. Impaired bone health, defined by at least one pathological screening parameter, was detected in 77%. Despite recommendations for adequate vitamin D supplementation, 15% displayed a vitamin D deficiency associated with hyperparathyroidism. The applied score identified survivors with osteopathologies with high sensitivity and specificity. The median score did not differ between patients without and with severe vitamin D deficiency. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that impaired bone health and osteopathologies are common skeletal late effects following treatment of childhood ALL. Major contributing factors are BMT, irradiation and older age at diagnosis. Vitamin D deficiency likely accounts for hyperparathyroidism in some patients but does not seem to further affect bone health in this cohort. Survivors of ALL need thorough surveillance to investigate bone health, since bone morbidity is common and still poorly understood. Early detection and appropriate intervention may improve bone health.","['Schundeln, Michael M', 'Hauffa, Pia K', 'Munteanu, Martin', 'Kiewert, Cordula', 'Unger, Nicole', 'Bauer, Jens J', 'Hauffa, Berthold P', 'Grasemann, Corinna']","['Schundeln MM', 'Hauffa PK', 'Munteanu M', 'Kiewert C', 'Unger N', 'Bauer JJ', 'Hauffa BP', 'Grasemann C']",,"['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics III, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics III, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology, Department of Pediatrics II, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology, Department of Pediatrics II, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Division of Rare Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, St. Josef-Hospital, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.', 'Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology, Department of Pediatrics II, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Division of Rare Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, St. Josef-Hospital, Ruhr-University Bochum, Bochum, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200826,Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,,PMC7479062,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'bone health', 'childhood malignancies', 'osteopathologies', 'survivorship', 'vitamin D']",2020/09/29 06:00,2020/09/29 06:01,['2020/09/28 05:45'],"['2020/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/28 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2020.00509 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2020 Aug 26;8:509. doi: 10.3389/fped.2020.00509. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Schundeln, Hauffa, Munteanu, Kiewert, Unger, Bauer, Hauffa and', 'Grasemann.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The circRNA expression signatures discriminating acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were identified by microarray, followed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) validation. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic efficiencies of hsa_circ_0001857 and hsa_circ_0012152, and hsa_circ_0012152 was selected for Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis.

However, there is a large number of these patients who continue to relapse after receiving standard treatment. Accurate identification of patients at high risk of relapse and targeted therapy may significantly improve their prognosis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify significant prognostic factors for pediatric ALL and establish a novel nomogram for the prediction of survival. Methods: The ALL clinical data of Phases I and II of the Therapeutic Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) project were merged and randomly divided into training and validation groups. The LASSO regression model was used to select the specific factors related to the OS of the training group and generate prognostic nomograms according to the selected characteristics. The predictive accuracy of the nomogram for OS was verified using the concordance index of the training and validation groups, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for prognostic diagnosis, and the calibration curve. Results: A total of 1,000 children with ALL were included in the TARGET project. Of those, 489 patients had complete follow-up data for further analysis. The data were randomly divided into the training group (n = 345) and the validation group (n = 144). Seven clinical characteristics, namely age at diagnosis, peripheral white blood cells, bone marrow and CNS site of relapse, ETV6/RUNX1 fusion, TCF3/PBX1, and BCR/ABL1 status, were selected to construct the nomogram. The concordance indices of the training and validation groups were 0.809 (95% confidence interval: 0.766-0.852) and 0.826 (95% confidence interval: 0.767-0.885), respectively. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year OS in the training group were 0.804, 0.848, and 0.885, respectively, while that of the validation group were 0.777, 0.825, and 0.863, respectively. Moreover, the calibration curves demonstrated a favorable consistency between the predicted and actual survival probabilities. Conclusions: Independent predictors of OS in children with ALL included age at diagnosis, white blood cells, bone marrow site of relapse, CNS site of relapse, ETV6/RUNX1 fusion, TCF3/PBX1, and BCR/ABL1 status. The nomograms developed using these high-risk factors can more simply, accurately, and quantitatively predict the survival of children, and improve treatment and prognosis.","['Zhang, Dan', 'Cheng, Yu', 'Fan, Jia', 'Yao, Juan', 'Zhao, Zijun', 'Jiang, Yao', 'Li, Yiqin', 'Zuo, Zhihua', 'Tang, Yan', 'Guo, Yongcan']","['Zhang D', 'Cheng Y', 'Fan J', 'Yao J', 'Zhao Z', 'Jiang Y', 'Li Y', 'Zuo Z', 'Tang Y', 'Guo Y']",,"['Clinical Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital Affiliated to Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.', 'Sichuan Luzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Luzhou, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital Affiliated to Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital Affiliated to Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital Affiliated to Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.', 'Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.', 'Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.', 'Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Jinniu Maternity and Child Health Hospital of Chengdu, Chengdu, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital Affiliated to Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200825,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7477348,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'nomogram', 'overall survival', 'prognosis', 'prognostic factor']",2020/09/29 06:00,2020/09/29 06:01,['2020/09/28 05:44'],"['2020/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/28 05:44 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.01550 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Aug 25;10:1550. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01550. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Zhang, Cheng, Fan, Yao, Zhao, Jiang, Li, Zuo, Tang and Guo.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty cases of de novo acute leukemia patients, 24 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 16 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), presented at the Oncology Center of Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt, with a follow-up period of 26 months. Syndecan-1 was determined in serum and leukocytes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results from acute leukemia patients were compared with those of 15 healthy subjects. We observed that soluble syndecan-1 was higher in AML (median, 160.60 ng/ml) compared with ALL (median, 76.10 ng/ml) and healthy controls (median, 30.95 ng/ml). There was a significant correlation between syndecan-1 either in leukocytes or soluble form and response to treatment in patients with AML (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04, respectively), but these correlations were not statistically significant for ALL cases. Finally, there was a significant correlation between the soluble syndecan-1 level and overall survival in AML cases (p = 0.04), but the correlation was not significant for ALL cases.

Introduction of new drugs in CLL clinical practice has showed impressive efficacy, in particular those targeting BTK. Among the consistent clinical data, an increasing number of reports describing the occurrence of unexpected opportunistic fungal infections has been reported during treatment with ibrutinib in the first 6 months of treatment. The reason underlying manifestations of invasive fungal infections in patients treated with ibrutinib is still under investigation. Our study aimed to understand the impact of BTK inhibition on immune response to fungal infection mediated by macrophages and CD14+ monocytic population obtained from CLL patients. Exposure to ibrutinib and acalabrutinib reduced signaling pathways activated by Aspergillus fumigatus determining an exacerbation of an immunosuppressive signature, a reduction of phagocytosis and a significant deficit in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines either in macrophages and monocytes isolated from CLL patients and healthy donors. These effects lead to a failure in completely counteracting conidia germination. In addition we investigated the biological effects of ibrutinib on monocyte counterpart in patients who were undergoing therapy. A significant impairment in cytokine secretion and a deficit of phagocytosis in circulating monocytes were detected after 3 months of treatment. Thus, our results uncover modifications in the innate response in CLL patients induced by ibrutinib that may impair the immunological response to fungal infection. KEYPOINTS: *BTK inhibition affects a productive immune response of CLL-associated macrophages (NLC) during Aspergillus fumigatus infection.*Reduction of TNF-alpha secretion and phagocytosis are detected in monocytes isolated from CLL patients during ibrutinib therapy.","['Fiorcari, Stefania', 'Maffei, Rossana', 'Vallerini, Daniela', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Barozzi, Patrizia', 'Maccaferri, Monica', 'Potenza, Leonardo', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Luppi, Mario', 'Marasca, Roberto']","['Fiorcari S', 'Maffei R', 'Vallerini D', 'Scarfo L', 'Barozzi P', 'Maccaferri M', 'Potenza L', 'Ghia P', 'Luppi M', 'Marasca R']",,"['Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Oncology and Hematology, A.O.U of Modena, Policlinico, Modena, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Oncology and Hematology, A.O.U of Modena, Policlinico, Modena, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCCS Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200828,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/*immunology', 'Aspergillus fumigatus/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunomodulation', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Macrophages/*immunology/microbiology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Piperidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",PMC7485008,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic lymphocytic le', '*fungal infection', '*ibrutinib', '*immunomodulation', '*macrophages']",2020/09/29 06:00,2021/05/27 06:00,['2020/09/28 05:41'],"['2020/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/28 05:41 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.02158 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Aug 28;11:2158. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.02158. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Fiorcari, Maffei, Vallerini, Scarfo, Barozzi, Maccaferri,', 'Potenza, Ghia, Luppi and Marasca.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, several clinical models were established to determine the optimal donors who would exhibit a graft-vs. -leukemia (GVL) effect without developing graft-vs. -host disease (GVHD). In addition, hypotheses about specific beneficial receptor-ligand pairs and KIR genes have been raised and the favorable effects of alloreactive NK cells are being investigated.

Here we show that ablation of the tyrosine kinase LCK, which has previously been characterized as a main NFAT2 target gene in CLL, leads to loss of the anergic phenotype, thereby restoring BCR signaling, which results in an acceleration of CLL.

We aimed to evaluate various risk factors of pediatric oncologic diseases after conducting chemotherapy and HSCT to induce PRES for predicting the clinical prognosis frequency. Methods: The literature was performed on PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases to recognize the qualified studies. The odds ratios (ORs) of related risk factors and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compute the pooled assessments of the outcomes. Results: Six studies were included in the meta-analysis, involving 828 records. The risk of female children has a significantly higher incidence than male children in oncologic age groups of PRES. Children over the age of 10 years old in oncologic age groups develop a significantly increased risk of PRES. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has a significant promotion effect on the occurrence of PRES. Hypertension can promote the occurrence of PRES in children. The risk of PRES in immunodeficient children increases significantly. Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a significantly increased risk of PRES. The risk of PRES in children with T-cell leukemia rises considerably. The central nervous system (CNS) leukemia/involvement has a significant role in promoting the occurrence of PRES in children. The pooled OR for the factors male, >/= 10 years old of age, acute GVHD, hypertension, immunodeficiency, SCD, T-cell leukemia, CNS leukemia/involvement was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.76; P < 0.00001), 2.06 (95% CI: 1.23, 3.43; P < 0.006), 1.32 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.53; P < 0.0003), 8.84 (95% CI: 7.57, 10.32; P < 0.00001), 2.72 (95% CI: 1.81, 4.08; P < 0.00001), 2.87 (95% CI: 2.15, 3.83; P < 0.00001), 2.84 (95% CI: 1.65, 4.88; P < 0.0002), and 3.13 (95% CI: 1.43, 6.84; P < 0.004), respectively.

The nuclear receptors Nur77 is a common feature in leukemic blasts and has emerged as a key therapeutic target for AML. Cantharidin (CTD), a main medicinal component of Mylabris (blister beetle), exerts an anticancer effect in multiple types of cancer cells. Purpose: This study aims to characterize the anti-AML activity of CTD in vitro and in vivo and explore the potential role of Nur77 signaling pathway. Study Design/Methods: The inhibition of CTD on cell viability was performed in different AML cells, and then the inhibition of CTD on proliferation and colony formation was detected in HL-60 cells. Induction of apoptosis and promotion of differentiation by CTD were further determined. Then, the potential role of Nur77 signaling pathway was assessed. Finally, anti-AML activity was evaluated in NOD/SCID mice. Results: In our study, CTD exhibited potent inhibition on cell viability and colony formation ability of AML cells. Moreover, CTD significantly induced the apoptosis, which was partially reversed by Z-VAD-FMK. Meanwhile, CTD promoted the cleavage of caspases 8, 3 and PARP in HL-60 cells. Furthermore, CTD obviously suppressed the proliferation and induced the cell cycle arrest of HL-60 cells at G2/M phase. Meanwhile, CTD effectively promoted the differentiation of HL-60 cells. Notably, CTD transiently induced the expression of Nur77 protein. Interestingly, CTD promoted Nur77 translocation from the nucleus to the mitochondria and enhanced the interaction between Nur77 and Bcl-2, resulting in the exposure of the BH3 domain of Bcl-2, which is critical for the conversion of Bcl-2 from an antiapoptotic to a proapoptotic protein. Importantly, silencing of Nur77 attenuated CTD-induced apoptosis, reversed CTD-mediated cell cycle arrest and differentiation of HL-60 cells. Additionally, CTD also exhibited an antileukemic effect in NOD/SCID mice with the injection of HL-60 cells into the tail vein. Conclusions: Our studies suggest that Nur77-mediated signaling pathway may play a critical role in the induction of apoptosis and promotion of differentiation by CTD on AML cells.","['Yu, Zanyang', 'Li, Li', 'Wang, Chengqiang', 'He, Hui', 'Liu, Gen', 'Ma, Haoyue', 'Pang, Lei', 'Jiang, Mingdong', 'Lu, Qianwei', 'Li, Pan', 'Qi, Hongyi']","['Yu Z', 'Li L', 'Wang C', 'He H', 'Liu G', 'Ma H', 'Pang L', 'Jiang M', 'Lu Q', 'Li P', 'Qi H']",,"['College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.', ""Radiotherapy Department, Chongqing Ninth People's Hospital, Chongqing, China."", ""Radiotherapy Department, Chongqing Ninth People's Hospital, Chongqing, China."", ""Radiotherapy Department, Chongqing Ninth People's Hospital, Chongqing, China."", 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200828,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC7485522,['NOTNLM'],"['Nur77', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'cantharidin', 'differentiation']",2020/09/29 06:00,2020/09/29 06:01,['2020/09/28 05:39'],"['2020/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/28 05:39 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2020.01321 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Aug 28;11:1321. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2020.01321. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Yu, Li, Wang, He, Liu, Ma, Pang, Jiang, Lu, Li and Qi.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are involved in the regeneration of damaged tissue or cells, due to their self-renewal characteristics. Tissue or cells can be damaged through a variety of diseases, including hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies. In regard to this, stem-cell transplantation is a cellular therapeutic approach to restore those impaired cells, tissue, or organs. SCs have a therapeutic potential in the application of stem-cell transplantation. Research has been focused mainly on the application of hematopoietic SCs for transplantation. Cord blood cells and human leukocyte antigen-haploidentical donors are considered optional sources of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. On the other hand, pluripotent embryonic SCs and induced pluripotent SCs hold promise for advancement of stem-cell transplantation. In addition, nonhematopoietic mesenchymal SCs play their own significant role as a functional bone-marrow niche and in the management of graft-vs-host disease effects during the posttransplantation process. In this review, the role of different types of SCs is presented with regard to their application in SC transplantation. In addition to this, the therapeutic value of autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is assessed with respect to different types of leukemia.

Taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) is a long non-coding RNA that has been associated with human cancers, including AML. However, the role and molecular mechanisms of TUG1 in AML remains to be defined. Methods: Expression of TUG1 and miR-185 was detected using RT-qPCR. Cell viability and apoptotic rate were measured by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Glycolysis was determined by commercial glucose and lactate assay kits and Western blot. The target binding between TUG1 and miR-185 was predicted on Starbase online database and confirmed by luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Results: TUG1 was upregulated and miR-185 was downregulated in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of AML specimens and cells (HL-60, KG-1, MOLM-14, and MOLM-13). Both TUG1 knockdown and miR-185 overexpression via transfection could suppress cell viability, glucose consumption, lactate production, and hexokinase 2 expression, but promote apoptotic rate in HL-60 and KG-1 cells. Notably, TUG1 functioned as a sponge of miR-185 by target binding. Moreover, downregulation of miR-185 could partially overturn the effect of TUG1 knockdown on cell proliferation and glycolysis in HL-60 and KG-1 cells. Conclusion: Expression of TUG1 was upregulated in AML patients and cells, and its knockdown repressed cell proliferation and glycolysis in AML cells in vitro by targeting miR-185.","['Zhang, Weide', 'Liu, Yuhua', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Zheng, Ni']","['Zhang W', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang J', 'Zheng N']",,"[""Department of Hematology, The People's Hospital of Shouguang, Shouguang, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Digestive Oncology, The Gansu Provincial Cancer Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Psychiatry, Shouguang Mental and Health Care Center, Shouguang, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shengli Oilfield Central Hospital, Dongying, Shandong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200807,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC7493018,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'TUG1', 'glycolysis', 'miR-185']",2020/09/29 06:00,2020/09/29 06:01,['2020/09/28 05:37'],"['2019/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/28 05:37 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S238189 [doi]', '238189 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2020 Aug 7;13:7887-7896. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S238189. eCollection 2020.,['(c) 2020 Zhang et al.'],,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests for this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relapse of ALL in the female genital organs, particularly the uterus, is markedly rare. We report such a patient who developed relapse in the bone marrow and uterus. The uterine lesion, which presented as abnormal uterine bleeding, consisted of a mass on MRI and proliferation of ALL cells on histology. MRI revealed a heterogeneous high-intensity mass (T2-WI/D-WI) with a diameter of 6.8 cm, a notable decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and mild enhancement by contrast enhancement study. Histological findings of the uterine cervix demonstrated the infiltration of ALL. The patient achieved remission by allogeneic haplo-identical hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, but died of complications of the transplantation. This case suggested that attention should be paid to the uterus as a site of extramedullary relapse. In addition, abnormal uterine bleeding, which is a common sign of hormonal imbalance and hormone replacement therapy after chemotherapy, may be an initial sign of extramedullary recurrence. To confirm uterine relapse as an intractable disease, the accumulation of more cases is required.","['Kawano, Noriaki', 'Maeda, Tetsuo', 'Kawano, Sayaka', 'Naghiro, Yuri', 'Takami, Akiyoshi', 'Tochigi, Taro', 'Nakaike, Takashi', 'Yamashita, Kiyoshi', 'Kodama, Takao', 'Marutsuka, Kosuke', 'Sugimoto, Yuka', 'Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Mori, Yasuo', 'Ochiai, Hidenobu', 'Hidaka, Tomonori', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Mashiba, Koichi', 'Kikuchi, Ikuo']","['Kawano N', 'Maeda T', 'Kawano S', 'Naghiro Y', 'Takami A', 'Tochigi T', 'Nakaike T', 'Yamashita K', 'Kodama T', 'Marutsuka K', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Imamura T', 'Mori Y', 'Ochiai H', 'Hidaka T', 'Shimoda K', 'Mashiba K', 'Kikuchi I']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Osaka, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Jozan Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Mie, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Trauma and Critical Care Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Miyazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics/*pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Uterine Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Uterus/*pathology']",PMC7596908,['NOTNLM'],"['MRI features', 'Philadelphia-negative B-ALL', 'refractory clinical course', 'uterine relapse']",2020/09/29 06:00,2021/01/21 06:00,['2020/09/28 05:35'],"['2020/09/28 05:35 [entrez]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3960/jslrt.20016 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2020;60(3):103-107. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.20016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present long-term safety data for niraparib from the ENGOT-OV16/NOVA trial. METHODS: This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of niraparib for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either once-daily niraparib 300 mg or placebo. Two independent cohorts were enrolled based on germline BRCA mutation status. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, reported previously. Long-term safety data were from the most recent data cutoff (September 2017). RESULTS: Overall, 367 patients received niraparib 300 mg once daily. Dose reductions due to TEAEs were highest in month 1 (34%) and declined every month thereafter. Incidence of any-grade and grade >/= 3 hematologic and symptomatic TEAEs was also highest in month 1 and subsequently declined. Incidence of grade >/= 3 thrombocytopenia decreased from 28% (month 1) to 9% and 5% (months 2 and 3, respectively), with protocol-directed dose interruptions and/or reductions. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were reported in 2 and 6 niraparib-treated patients, respectively, and in 1 placebo patient each. Treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs were <5% in each month and time interval measured. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the importance of appropriate dose reduction according to toxicity criteria and support the safe long-term use of niraparib for maintenance treatment in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.

These approaches based on less myelosuppressive drugs have led to improved response rates, decreased relapse rates, with a benefit in survival observed in patients aged up to 50-60-years-old. Therapeutic intensification came with a decrease in the use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with current indications mainly based on the level of measurable residual disease. Pediatric approaches are however limited in older patients or in patients with comorbidities, who are at greater risk to develop adverse effects especially to asparaginase. Future progresses will arise from personalized medicine including targeted therapy in some ALL oncogenic subgroups and immunotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, antibody drug conjugates and CAR-T cells have shown encouraging results in relapsed/refractory diseases. These strategies are now evaluated frontline in children and adults to further increase the quality of response, to limit the toxicity of treatments including allogeneic transplant.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the results of the use of monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates for the therapy of malignant hemopathies. METHODS: A mini-review was achieved using the articles published in Web of Science and PubMed between January 2017 and January 2020 and the new patents were made in this field. RESULTS: Naked monoclonal antibodies have improved the therapeutic results obtained with standard of care, but they also have side effects and the use of some of them can lead to the loss of the target antigen through trogocytosis, which explains the resistance that occurs during therapy. The results obtained with naked monoclonal antibodies have been improved by a better monoclonal antibody preparation, the use of bispecific antibodies (against two antigens on the target cell surface or by binding both surface antigen on target cells and T-cell receptor complex, followed by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes activation and subsequent cytolysis of the target cell), the use of monoclonal or bispecific constructs in frontline regimens, combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy, including through the use of antibody-drug conjugates (which provides a targeted release of a chemotherapeutic agent). CONCLUSION: Immunotherapy and immuno-chemotherapy have improved the outcome of the patients with malignant hemopathies through a targeted, personalized therapy, with reduced systemic toxicity, which in some cases can even induce deep complete remissions, including minimal residual disease negativity.","['Mihaila, Romeo G']",['Mihaila RG'],,"['Faculty of Medicine, Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu, Hematology Department, Emergency County Clinical Hospital Sibiu, Sibiu 550169, Romania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Recent Pat Anticancer Drug Discov,Recent patents on anti-cancer drug discovery,101266081,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Patents as Topic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Antibody-drug conjugate', 'bispecific antibody', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'monoclonal antibody', 'obinutuzumab', 'ofatumumab', 'rituximab.']",2020/09/29 06:00,2021/09/18 06:00,['2020/09/28 05:27'],"['2020/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/28 05:27 [entrez]']","['PRA-EPUB-110230 [pii]', '10.2174/1574892815666200925120717 [doi]']",ppublish,Recent Pat Anticancer Drug Discov. 2020;15(4):272-292. doi: 10.2174/1574892815666200925120717.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The different prognostic factors (age, leukocytes, risk, cytogenetic alterations) allow identifying those patients with a high risk of relapse, but there are few described factors that impact the induction response. The objective was to identify the utility of different risk factors (overexpression of the ABCB1 drug resistance gene, favorable response to steroids (FRS) and early response at day + 8 of treatment) on the percentage of complete remissions and overall survival. This is a prospective, observational study in adult patients with B-ALL without specific cytogenetic alterations, who started induction treatment based on a pretreatment with prednisone and subsequently vincristine (1.6 mg/m(2) subcutaneous) plus daunorubicin (45 mg/m(2) subcutaneously) on days + 1, + 8, + 15. The ABCB1 resistance gene was evaluated at diagnosis, the FRS at the end of the pretreatment and the early response during day + 8. A total of 53 adult patients diagnosed with ALL Philadelphia negative chromosome (Ph(-)), with immunophenotype B, with a normal karyotype, were studied. Cases with genetic abnormalities with a poor prognosis were excluded in order to reduce bias. The mean age was 48 years (range 17-68 years). 62.3% of patients were at high risk of relapse. When analyzing the risk factors, 30.2% showed high levels of the ABCB1 resistance gene, without showing an impact on the induction response (OR: 1.218, p = 0.743), but its overexpression was associated with a poor response to steroids as in the absence of early response. Individually, both the FRS (OR: 5.7, p = 0.004) and the absence of early response to day + 8 (OR: 6.42, p = 0.002) showed significance. By combining the different factors, having more than 2 was directly related to a failure (OR: 9.514, p = 0.000). The identification of factors such as FRS such as the persistence of blasts at the end of the first week of treatment is useful to identify patients at risk of failure in induction.","['Ramos-Penafiel, Christian', 'Olarte-Carrillo, Irma', 'Maldonado, Rafael Ceron', 'de la Cruz Rosas, Adrian', 'Collazo-Jaloma, Juan', 'Martinez-Tovar, Adolfo']","['Ramos-Penafiel C', 'Olarte-Carrillo I', 'Maldonado RC', 'de la Cruz Rosas A', 'Collazo-Jaloma J', 'Martinez-Tovar A']",,"['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico, ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"", 06726, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico, ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"", Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico, ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"", Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico, ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"", Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico, ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"", 06726, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico, ""Dr. Eduardo Liceaga"", 06726, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico. mtadolfo73@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20200927,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/biosynthesis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ABCB1 = ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1', 'ALL = Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'BM + 8 = Early morphological response', 'RFE = Favorable response to steroids', 'qRT-PCR = quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction']",2020/09/28 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/09/27 20:37'],"['2020/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/27 20:37 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04277-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04277-y [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Nov;99(11):2629-2637. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04277-y.

Here, we used a customized RNA fusion gene panel to investigate gene fusions in 56 selected acute leukemia patients without conventional genetic abnormalities. Two EP300-ZNF384 fusion forms were detected in ten cases, which were in-frame fusions of EP300 exon 6 fused with exon 3 or 2 of ZNF384. The fusions led to the lack of most functional domains of EP300. We firstly reported EP300-ZNF384 fusion in a mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) patient whose CD33 and CD13 were negative. The rest nine B-ALL patients with EP300-ZNF384 fusion expressed CD33 and/or CD13. Fifty-six percent of B-ALL patients (5/9) with EP300-ZNF384 fusion were positive with CD10. After the diagnosis of EP300-ZNF384 fusion, 70% of the patients achieved remission after chemotherapy. Our observations indicated that EP300-ZNF384 fusion consists of a distinct subgroup of B-ALL with a characteristic immunophenotype. These patients are sensitive to current chemotherapy regimen and have an excellent outcome.","['Jing, Yu', 'Li, Yan-Fen', 'Wan, Hua', 'Liu, Dai-Hong']","['Jing Y', 'Li YF', 'Wan H', 'Liu DH']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, 100853, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, 100853, Beijing, China."", 'Beijing USCI Medical Laboratory, Beijing, 100195, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, 100853, Beijing, China. daihongrm@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200926,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (ZNF384 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', '*E1A-Associated p300 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', '*Sequence Analysis, RNA', '*Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7536166,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'EP300', 'Fusion', 'RNA sequencing', 'ZNF384']",2020/09/28 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/09/27 20:37'],"['2020/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/27 20:37 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04251-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04251-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Nov;99(11):2611-2617. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04251-8.

Abnormal changes in DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of pathways involved in hematopoietic development, such as Wnt/beta-catenin, contribute to the transformation, development, and maintenance of leukemic cells. This review summarizes the alterations of Wnt signaling-related genes at the epigenetic and transcriptional level and their implications for AML prognosis. Among the implications of epigenetic alterations in AML, methylation of Wnt antagonists is related to poor prognosis, whereas their upregulation has been associated with a better clinical outcome. Furthermore, Wnt target genes c-Myc and LEF-1 present distinct implications. LEF-1 expression positively influences the patient overall survival. c-Myc upregulation has been associated with treatment resistance in AML, although c-Myc expression is not exclusively dependent of Wnt signaling. Understanding the signaling abnormalities could help us to further understand leukemogenesis, improve the current risk stratification for AML patients, and even serve to propose novel therapeutic targets.","['Cardona-Echeverry, Andres', 'Prada-Arismendy, Jeanette']","['Cardona-Echeverry A', 'Prada-Arismendy J']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4273-9730', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4779-1941']","['Grupo de Investigacion e innovacion Biomedica-GI2B, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Aplicadas, Instituto Tecnologico Metropolitano-ITM, 050034, Medellin, Colombia.', 'Grupo de Investigacion e innovacion Biomedica-GI2B, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Aplicadas, Instituto Tecnologico Metropolitano-ITM, 050034, Medellin, Colombia. jpradaarismendy@yahoo.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200927,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Gene expression', 'Methylation', 'Prognosis', 'Wnt/beta-catenin']",2020/09/28 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/09/27 20:37'],"['2019/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/27 20:37 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-020-03407-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-020-03407-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2020 Dec;146(12):3097-3109. doi: 10.1007/s00432-020-03407-3.

This case is written following the SCARE criteria. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 73 years old Caucasian man underwent laparoscopic right adrenalectomy for a rapidly increasing expansive mass (3.5 x 2.5 cm) of the right adrenal gland. The night of intervention, patient underwent urgent explorative laparotomy, that highlighted massive haemoperitoneum, clots in the abdomen, on the splenic side, on Morrison's space, and at the confluence between right renal vein and inferior vena cava. Surgical specimen examination showed extra-medullary myeloid proliferation of the right periadrenal tissue. DISCUSSION: Bone marrow biopsy was performed. The list of differential diagnoses included: chronic myelomonocitic leukaemia, atypical CML and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). After discharge, several results became available: conventional cytogenetics was normal, PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta and FGFR1 mutations were negative but V617 F mutation of the JAK2 gene was positive. Therefore, the final diagnosis was pre-fibrotic primary myelofibrosis according to the 2016 WHO classification, Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) plus 2 (intermediate-2). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, we report uncommon case of primary myelofibrosis associated with extra-medullary myeloid proliferation of the right periadrenal tissue.","['Colozzi, Sara', 'Costantini, Benedetta', 'Rupoli, Serena', 'Olivieri, Attilio', 'Ortenzi, Monica', 'Guerrieri, Mario']","['Colozzi S', 'Costantini B', 'Rupoli S', 'Olivieri A', 'Ortenzi M', 'Guerrieri M']",,"[""Clinica Chirurgica Generale e d'Urgenza, AOU Umberto I-Lancisi-Salesi, Ancona, Italy.

There are relatively few quantitative neuroimaging studies in child and adolescent ALL survivors treated with chemotherapy only. Use of different outcome measures or limited sample sizes restrict our ability to make inferences about patterns of brain development following chemotherapy treatment. In this study, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate brain outcomes in ALL survivors, comparing against a group of typically developing, cancer free peers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants included 71 ALL survivors, on average 8 years after diagnosis and 8-18 years of age, and 83 typically developing controls. Anatomical MRI was performed to evaluate brain structure; diffusion and magnetization transfer MRI were used to examine brain tissue microstructure. RESULTS: Successful MRI scans were acquired in 67 survivors (94%) and 82 controls (99%). Structurally, ALL survivors exhibited widespread reductions in brain volume, with 6% less white matter and 5% less gray matter than controls (p = 0.003 and 0.0006 respectively). Much of the brain appeared affected - 71 of 90 evaluated structures showed smaller volume - with the most notable exception being the occipital lobe, where no significant differences were observed. Average full-scale IQ in the survivor and control groups were 95 (CI 92-99) and 110 (CI 107-113), respectively. Using data from the NIH Pediatric MRI Data Repository, we evaluated the extent to which elevated IQ in the control group might affect the structural differences observed. We estimated that two thirds of the observed brain differences were attributable to ALL and its treatment. In addition to the structural changes, survivors showed, on average, globally lower white matter fractional anisotropy (-3%) and higher radial diffusivity (+5%) (p < 10(-6)), but no differences in magnetization transfer ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroanatomical alterations in late childhood and adolescent ALL survivors treated with chemotherapy-only protocols are widespread, with white matter being somewhat more affected than gray matter.

In addition to illustrating the refractoriness and poor outcomes of multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis in adults, specific events in this case highlight important characteristics of disease biology that warrant detailed discussion and exposition to a wider audience. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 42-year-old Caucasian man with Langerhans cell histiocytosis diagnosed from a lesion on the left arm that presented with constitutional symptoms, early satiety, and weight loss. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed extensive esophageal and duodenal involvement by Langerhans cell histiocytosis with features of Langerhans cell sarcoma. He was initially treated for Langerhans cell histiocytosis with low doses of cytarabine until he eventually presented clear transformation to acute monoblastic leukemia with complex karyotype that could not be properly controlled, leading eventually to death. CONCLUSIONS: Langerhans cell histiocytosis remains an exceedingly rare entity in adults, frequently presenting as multisystem disease with risk organ involvement. Langerhans cell sarcoma represents an aggressive subtype with extremely poor prognosis for which intensive acute myeloid leukemia induction should be strongly considered.","['Aguirre, Luis E', 'Schwartz, Ingrid', 'Chapman, Jennifer', 'Larsen, Marcelo F', 'Alencar, Alvaro']","['Aguirre LE', 'Schwartz I', 'Chapman J', 'Larsen MF', 'Alencar A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5377-9252'],"['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Clinical Research Building, 1120 NW 14th Street, Suite 650B, Miami, FL, 33136, USA. aalencar@med.miami.edu.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200927,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Cytarabine', '*Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prognosis', '*Sarcoma', '*Soft Tissue Neoplasms']",PMC7520028,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Central nervous system', 'Chemotherapy', 'Colony-stimulating factor', 'Cytogenetics', 'Langerhans cell histiocytosis', 'Langerhans cell sarcoma', 'Leukemic transformation']",2020/09/28 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/27 20:18'],"['2019/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/27 20:18 [entrez]', '2020/09/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-020-02460-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-020-02460-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2020 Sep 27;14(1):169. doi: 10.1186/s13256-020-02460-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to identify the mechanisms involved in the protein turnover of friend leukemia integration 1 and erythroblast transformation-specific in microvascular endothelial cells. METHODS: The effects of lysosome and proteosome inhibitors on friend leukemia integration 1 and erythroblast transformation-specific levels were assessed by Western blotting and capillary morphogenesis. The effect of scleroderma and control sera on the levels of friend leukemia integration 1 and erythroblast transformation-specific was examined. RESULTS: The reduction in the protein levels of friend leukemia integration 1 and erythroblast transformation-specific in response to interferon alpha or Poly:(IC) was reversed by blocking either lysosomal (leupeptin and Cathepsin B inhibitor) or proteosomal degradation (MG132). MG132, leupeptin or CTSB-(i) also counteracted the anti-angiogenic effects of Poly:(IC) or interferon alpha. Scleroderma sera reduced protein levels of friend leukemia integration 1 and erythroblast transformation-specific in comparison to control sera. Treatment with CTSB(i) increased the levels of friend leukemia integration 1 and erythroblast transformation-specific in a majority of serum-treated samples. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of cathepsin B was effective in reversing the reduction of friend leukemia integration 1 and erythroblast transformation-specific protein levels after treatment with interferon alpha or scleroderma sera, suggesting that targeting cathepsin B may have a beneficial effect in SSc vascular disease.","['Mazzotta, Celestina', 'Marden, Grace', 'Farina, Alessandra', 'Bujor, Andreea', 'Trojanowski, Marcin A', 'Trojanowska, Maria']","['Mazzotta C', 'Marden G', 'Farina A', 'Bujor A', 'Trojanowski MA', 'Trojanowska M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7549-8902', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7782-5420', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3948-6920', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8840-8937', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2583-1591', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9550-7178']","['Arthritis and Autoimmune Diseases Center, School of Medicine, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Arthritis and Autoimmune Diseases Center, School of Medicine, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Arthritis and Autoimmune Diseases Center, School of Medicine, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Arthritis and Autoimmune Diseases Center, School of Medicine, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Arthritis and Autoimmune Diseases Center, School of Medicine, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Arthritis and Autoimmune Diseases Center, School of Medicine, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20201009,United States,Microcirculation,"Microcirculation (New York, N.Y. : 1994)",9434935,"['0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (CTSB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cathepsin B/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dermis/*metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Microvessels/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', '*Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG/metabolism']",PMC7988617,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cathepsin B', '*ERG', '*FLI1', '*endothelial cells', '*scleroderma']",2020/09/27 06:00,2021/11/09 06:00,['2020/09/26 20:19'],"['2020/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/26 20:19 [entrez]']",['10.1111/micc.12660 [doi]'],ppublish,Microcirculation. 2021 Jan;28(1):e12660. doi: 10.1111/micc.12660.

The PLpro have significant functional implications in the innate immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection and considered an important antiviral target. Both proteases share strikingly similar USP fold with right-handed thumb-palm-fingers structural scaffold and conserved catalytic triad Cys-His-Asp/Asn. In this urgency situation of COVID-19 outbreak, there is a lack of in-vitro facilities readily available to test SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors in whole-cell assays. Therefore, we adopted an alternate route to identify potential USP2 inhibitor through integrated in-silico efforts. After an extensive virtual screening protocol, the best compounds were selected and tested. The compound Z93 showed significant IC50 value against Jurkat (9.67 muM) and MOTL-4 cells (11.8 muM). The binding mode of Z93 was extensively analyzed through molecular docking, followed by MD simulations, and molecular interactions were compared with SARS-CoV-2. The relative binding poses of Z93 fitted well in the binding site of both proteases and showed consensus pi-pi stacking and H-bond interactions with histidine and aspartate/asparagine residues of the catalytic triad. These results led us to speculate that compound Z93 might be the first potential chemical lead against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, which warrants in-vitro evaluations.","['Mirza, Muhammad Usman', 'Ahmad, Sarfraz', 'Abdullah, Iskandar', 'Froeyen, Matheus']","['Mirza MU', 'Ahmad S', 'Abdullah I', 'Froeyen M']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Medicinal Chemistry, University of Leuven, B-3000, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, 50603, Malaysia.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, 50603, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Medicinal Chemistry, University of Leuven, B-3000, Leuven, Belgium.

EcAII activity in vivo has been described to be influenced by the human lysosomal proteases asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) and cathepsin B (CTSB); these hydrolases cleave and could expose epitopes associated with the immune response against EcAII. In this work, we show that ASNase resistance to CTSB and/or AEP influences the formation of anti-ASNase antibodies, one of the main causes of hypersensitivity reactions in patients. Error-prone polymerase chain reaction was used to produce variants of EcAII more resistant to proteolytic cleavage by AEP and CTSB. The variants with enzymatic activity and cytotoxicity levels equivalent to or better than EcAII WT were submitted to in vivo assays. Only one of the mutants presented increased serum half-life, so resistance to these proteases is not the only feature involved in EcAII stability in vivo. Our results showed alteration of the phenotypic profile of B cells isolated after animal treatment with different protease-resistant proteoforms. Furthermore, mice that were exposed to the protease-resistant proteoforms presented lower anti-asparaginase antibodies production in vivo. Our data suggest that modulating resistance to lysosomal proteases can result in less immunogenic protein drugs.","['Rodrigues, Mariane A D', 'Pimenta, Marcela V', 'Costa, Iris M', 'Zenatti, Priscila P', 'Migita, Natacha A', 'Yunes, Jose A', 'Rangel-Yagui, Carlota O', 'de Sa, Matheus M', 'Pessoa, Adalberto', 'Costa-Silva, Tales A', 'Toyama, Marcos H', 'Breyer, Carlos A', 'de Oliveira, Marcos A', 'Santiago, Veronica F', 'Palmisano, Giuseppe', 'Barbosa, Christiano M V', 'Hebeda, Cristina B', 'Farsky, Sandra H P', 'Monteiro, Gisele']","['Rodrigues MAD', 'Pimenta MV', 'Costa IM', 'Zenatti PP', 'Migita NA', 'Yunes JA', 'Rangel-Yagui CO', 'de Sa MM', 'Pessoa A', 'Costa-Silva TA', 'Toyama MH', 'Breyer CA', 'de Oliveira MA', 'Santiago VF', 'Palmisano G', 'Barbosa CMV', 'Hebeda CB', 'Farsky SHP', 'Monteiro G']",,"['Departamento de Tecnologia Bioquimico-Farmaceutica, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Tecnologia Bioquimico-Farmaceutica, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Tecnologia Bioquimico-Farmaceutica, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Centro Infantil Boldrini, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Centro Infantil Boldrini, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medical Sciences, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Centro Infantil Boldrini, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medical Sciences, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Tecnologia Bioquimico-Farmaceutica, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Heart Institute (InCor), Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Tecnologia Bioquimico-Farmaceutica, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Tecnologia Bioquimico-Farmaceutica, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Biosciences Institute, UNESP - Sao Paulo State University, Coastal Campus, Sao Vicente, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Biosciences Institute, UNESP - Sao Paulo State University, Coastal Campus, Sao Vicente, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Biosciences Institute, UNESP - Sao Paulo State University, Coastal Campus, Sao Vicente, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Parasitology, Biomedical Sciences Institute, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Parasitology, Biomedical Sciences Institute, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analysis, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analysis, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analysis, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Tecnologia Bioquimico-Farmaceutica, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

For targeted treatment of EVI1 overexpressing AML a more detailed understanding of aspects of spatiotemporal interaction dynamics of the EVI1 protein is important. EVI1 overexpressing SB1690CB AML cells were used for quantification and protein interaction studies of EVI1 and DeltaEVI1. Cells were cell cycle-synchronised by mimosine and nocodazole treatment and expression of EVI1 and related proteins assessed by western blot, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence. EVI1 protein levels oscillate through the cell cycle, and EVI1 is degraded partly by the proteasome complex. Both EVI1 and DeltaEVI1 interact with the co-repressor CtBP1 but dissociate from CtBP1 complexes during mitosis. Furthermore, a large fraction of EVI1, but not DeltaEVI1 or CtBP1, resides in the nuclear matrix. In conclusion, EVI1- protein levels and EVI1-CtBP1 interaction dynamics vary though the cell cycle and differ between EVI1 and DeltaEVI1. These data ad to the functional characterisation of the EVI1 protein in AML and will be important for the development of targeted therapeutic approaches for EVI1-driven AML.","['Paredes, Roberto', 'Schneider, Marion', 'Pearson, Stella', 'Teng, Hsiang Yin', 'Kelly, James R', 'Pierce, Andrew', 'Somervaille, Tim C P', 'Whetton, Anthony D', 'Meyer, Stefan']","['Paredes R', 'Schneider M', 'Pearson S', 'Teng HY', 'Kelly JR', 'Pierce A', 'Somervaille TCP', 'Whetton AD', 'Meyer S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2283-3690'],"['Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Leukaemia Biology Group, CRUK Manchester Institute, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester, UK.', 'Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Division of Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. stefan.meyer@manchester.ac.uk.', 'Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester, UK. stefan.meyer@manchester.ac.uk.', ""Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, UK. stefan.meyer@manchester.ac.uk."", 'c/o Academic Unit of Paediatric Oncology, Young Oncology Unit, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Christie Hospital, Wilmslow Road, Manchester, M20 6XB, UK. stefan.meyer@manchester.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200926,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (C-terminal binding protein)']",IM,"['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Biological Clocks', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC7588369,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Cell cycle', 'CtBP1', 'EVI1']",2020/09/27 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/09/26 12:04'],"['2020/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/26 12:04 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-020-05829-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-020-05829-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2020 Oct;47(10):8293-8300. doi: 10.1007/s11033-020-05829-1.

Recently, two CAR T-cell products (axicabtagene ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel) have been approved for patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia; many other CAR-T constructs are in research for both hematological and non-hematological diseases. Most of the patients receiving CAR-T therapy will develop fever at some point after infusion, mainly due to cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The onset of CRS is often indistinguishable from an infection, which makes management of these patients challenging. In addition to the lymphodepleting chemotherapy and CAR T cells, the treatment of complications with corticosteroids and/or tocilizumab increases the risk of infection in these patients. Data regarding incidence, risk factors and prevention of infections in patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy are scarce. To assist in patient care, a multidisciplinary team from hospitals designated by the Spanish Ministry of Health to perform CAR-T therapy prepared these recommendations. We reviewed the literature on the incidence, risk factors, and management of infections in adult and pediatric patients receiving CAR-T cell treatment. Recommendations cover different areas: monitoring and treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia, prevention, prophylaxis, and management of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections as well as vaccination prior and after CAR-T cell therapy.","['Los-Arcos, Ibai', 'Iacoboni, Gloria', 'Aguilar-Guisado, Manuela', 'Alsina-Manrique, Laia', 'Diaz de Heredia, Cristina', 'Fortuny-Guasch, Claudia',

It may be a result of many different causes such as previous dermatoses (psoriasis, eczema, atopic dermatitis [AD], pityriasis rubra pilaris, and pemphigus foliaceous), drug reactions, malignancies (mycosis fungoides [MF], Sezary syndrome, adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma), infections, and idiopathic disorders. Regardless of the etiology, the clinical appearance of erythroderma is similar in all patients. The most prominent physical examination findings in almost all patients are diffuse erythema and scaling. In a 2-year period, 47 patients who were hospitalized and treated in our department were included in the study. We classified patients into seven subgroups: psoriasis, AD, drug-induced erythroderma, MF, pityriasis rubra pilaris, bullous pemphigoid, and polymorphous light eruption.

He was negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive for antibodies against the hepatitis B surface and core, and negative for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA before starting chemotherapy. A total of 13 months after the initiation of ibrutinib (a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor), the patient's alanine aminotransferase levels suddenly increased to 427 U/L. As the level of serum HBV-DNA increased to 5.2 logIU/mL, a diagnosis of HBV reactivation was made, whereas the patient remained negative for HBsAg. The patient's serum alanine aminotransferase levels normalized after the initiation of entecavir at a dose of 1 mg/day. However, it took >1 year to achieve an undetectable level of HBV-DNA, even with an add-on therapy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Interestingly, the patient remained negative for HBsAg throughout the clinical course owing to triple HBsAg escape mutations: Q101K, M133L, and G145A.","['Tsuruya, Kota', 'Anzai, Kazuya', 'Shioyama, Shunsuke', 'Ito, Ayano', 'Arase, Yoshitaka', 'Hirose, Shunji', 'Tanaka, Yasuhito', 'Suzuki, Hidekazu', 'Kagawa, Tatehiro']","['Tsuruya K', 'Anzai K', 'Shioyama S', 'Ito A', 'Arase Y', 'Hirose S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Suzuki H', 'Kagawa T']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9884-8039', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2473-6966']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201008,Netherlands,Hepatol Res,Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,9711801,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['hepatitis B', 'hepatitis B surface antigen', 'lymphocytic leukemia']",2020/09/27 06:00,2020/09/27 06:01,['2020/09/26 05:32'],"['2020/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/27 06:01 [medline]', '2020/09/26 05:32 [entrez]']",['10.1111/hepr.13575 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatol Res. 2021 Feb;51(2):239-244. doi: 10.1111/hepr.13575.

A second HSCT can be a life-saving alternative, however, information on the results of such intervention in an outpatient setting is limited. Outpatient second hematoprogenitors transplant after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) at a single academic center was analyzed. Twenty-seven consecutive adults who received an allo-HSCT after an initial auto- or allo-HSCT from 2006 to 2019 were included. Data were compared using the chi(2) -test. Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models was performed; cumulative incidence estimation of transplant-related mortality (TRM) was assessed. Hodgkin lymphoma was the most frequent diagnosis for the group with a first auto-HSCT with 5/12 (41.7%) cases, and acute myeloid leukemia for those with a first allo-HSCT with 6/15 (40%). One-year overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) was 66.7% (95% CI 27.2-88.2) and 59% (95% CI 16-86) for 12 patients with a first auto-HSCT; and for 15 patients with a first allo-HSCT, it was 43.3% (95% CI 17.9-66.5) and 36% (95% CI 13.2-59.9), respectively. Eight (29.6%) patients died of TRM and the cumulative incidence of TRM at 1 year was 22% (95% CI 8.6-39.27). Chronic graft-versus-host disease and late (>10 months) second transplantation were protective factors for longer survival. Neutropenic fever was more common in the group with a first allo-HSCT (p = 0.01). In conclusion, outpatient second allo-HSCT using RIC after auto- or allografting failure or relapse is feasible and offers a reasonable alternative for patients with severe life-threatening hematological diseases.","['Jaime-Perez, Jose Carlos', 'Picon-Galindo, Ernesto', 'Herrera-Garza, Jose Luis', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Jaime-Perez JC', 'Picon-Galindo E', 'Herrera-Garza JL', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6804-9095'],"['Department of Hematology, Internal Medicine Division, Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital and School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, Internal Medicine Division, Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital and School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, Internal Medicine Division, Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital and School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, Internal Medicine Division, Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez University Hospital and School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20201003,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,"['Adult', 'Allografts', '*Ambulatory Care', 'Autografts', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/etiology/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",,['NOTNLM'],"['allogeneic transplant', 'graft failure', 'outpatient-HSCT', 'reduced-intensity conditioning', 'relapse', 'second HSCT']",2020/09/27 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2020/09/26 05:31'],"['2020/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/26 05:31 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2812 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2021 Feb;39(1):87-96. doi: 10.1002/hon.2812.

METHODS: An HP PBPK model was developed in Simcyp Population-Based Simulator (version 15.1), with the CYP3A4 component refined based on a clinical DDI study. A separate model accounting for the reduced apparent oral clearance in patients with AML was used to assess the DDI potential of ivosidenib as the victim of CYP3A perpetrators. RESULTS: For a single 250 mg ivosidenib dose, the HP model predicted geometric mean ratios of 2.14 (plasma area under concentration-time curve, to infinity [AUC0-infinity]) and 1.04 (maximum plasma concentration [Cmax]) with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, itraconazole, within 1.26-fold of the observed values (2.69 and 1.0, respectively). The AML model reasonably predicted the observed ivosidenib concentration-time profiles across all dose levels in patients. Predicted ivosidenib geometric mean steady-state AUC0-infinity and Cmax ratios were 3.23 and 2.26 with ketoconazole, and 1.90 and 1.52 with fluconazole, respectively. Co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, predicted a greater DDI effect on a single dose of ivosidenib than on multiple doses (AUC ratios 0.35 and 0.67, Cmax ratios 0.91 and 0.81, respectively). CONCLUSION: Potentially clinically relevant DDI effects with CYP3A4 inducers and moderate and strong inhibitors co-administered with ivosidenib were predicted. Considering the challenges of conducting clinical DDI studies in patients, this PBPK approach is valuable in ivosidenib DDI risk assessment and management.","['Prakash, Chandra', 'Fan, Bin', 'Ke, Alice', 'Le, Kha', 'Yang, Hua']","['Prakash C', 'Fan B', 'Ke A', 'Le K', 'Yang H']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8662-3054'],"['Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.

However, there has been no appropriate integrative analysis on the hierarchy of different AML subtypes. METHODS: Using Microwell-seq, a high-throughput single-cell mRNA sequencing platform, we analyzed the cellular hierarchy of bone marrow samples from 40 patients and 3 healthy donors. We also used single-cell single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to investigate the clonal heterogeneity of AML cells. RESULTS: From the integrative analysis of 191727 AML cells, we established a single-cell AML landscape and identified an AML progenitor cell cluster with novel AML markers. Patients with ribosomal protein high progenitor cells had a low remission rate. We deduced two types of AML with diverse clinical outcomes. We traced mitochondrial mutations in the AML landscape by combining Microwell-seq with SMRT sequencing. We propose the existence of a phenotypic ""cancer attractor"" that might help to define a common phenotype for AML progenitor cells. Finally, we explored the potential drug targets by making comparisons between the AML landscape and the Human Cell Landscape. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a key AML progenitor cell cluster. A high ribosomal protein gene level indicates the poor prognosis. We deduced two types of AML and explored the potential drug targets. Our results suggest the existence of a cancer attractor.","['Wu, Junqing', 'Xiao, Yanyu', 'Sun, Jie', 'Sun, Huiyu', 'Chen, Haide', 'Zhu, Yuanyuan', 'Fu, Huarui', 'Yu, Chengxuan', 'E, Weigao', 'Lai,

Herein, we report a new class of amphiphilic dendritic species-triazine-carbosilane dendrons readily self-assembling into pH-sensitive dendrimersomes. The dendrimersomes efficiently encapsulate anticancer drugs doxorubicin and methotrexate. Chemodrug-loaded dendrimersomes have dose-related cytotoxic activity against leukaemia cell lines 1301 and K562. Our findings suggest that triazine-carbosilane dendrimersomes are prospective drug carriers for anti-cancer therapy.","['Apartsin, Evgeny', 'Knauer, Nadezhda', 'Arkhipova, Valeria', 'Pashkina, Ekaterina', 'Aktanova, Alina', 'Poletaeva, Julia', 'Sanchez-Nieves, Javier', 'de la Mata, Francisco Javier', 'Gomez, Rafael']","['Apartsin E', 'Knauer N', 'Arkhipova V', 'Pashkina E', 'Aktanova A', 'Poletaeva J', 'Sanchez-Nieves J', 'de la Mata FJ', 'Gomez R']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3334-0397', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5877-3909', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0410-2285', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0418-3935']","['Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine SB RAS, 8, Lavrentiev ave., 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Novosibirsk State University, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Laboratoire de Chimie de Coordination, CNRS, 31077 Toulouse, France.', 'Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine SB RAS, 8, Lavrentiev ave., 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Research Institute of Fundamental and Clinical Immunology, 630099 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine SB RAS, 8, Lavrentiev ave., 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Novosibirsk State University, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine SB RAS, 8, Lavrentiev ave., 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Research Institute of Fundamental and Clinical Immunology, 630099 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine SB RAS, 8, Lavrentiev ave., 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Research Institute of Fundamental and Clinical Immunology, 630099 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine SB RAS, 8, Lavrentiev ave., 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica y Quimica Inorganica, UAH-IQAR, Universidad de Alcala, 28805 Alcala de Henares, Spain.', 'Networking Research Center on Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica y Quimica Inorganica, UAH-IQAR, Universidad de Alcala, 28805 Alcala de Henares, Spain.', 'Networking Research Center on Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto Ramon y Cajal de Investigacion Sanitaria, IRYCIS, 28034 Madrid, Spain.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica y Quimica Inorganica, UAH-IQAR, Universidad de Alcala, 28805 Alcala de Henares, Spain.', 'Networking Research Center on Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto Ramon y Cajal de Investigacion Sanitaria, IRYCIS, 28034 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200923,Switzerland,Nanomaterials (Basel),"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",101610216,,,,PMC7598245,['NOTNLM'],"['amphiphile', 'carbosilane', 'dendron', 'doxorubicin', 'leukaemia', 'methotrexate', 'pH-sensitive', 'self-assembly', 'triazine', 'vesicles']",2020/09/27 06:00,2020/09/27 06:01,['2020/09/26 01:01'],"['2020/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/26 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/27 06:01 [medline]']","['nano10101899 [pii]', '10.3390/nano10101899 [doi]']",epublish,Nanomaterials (Basel). 2020 Sep 23;10(10). pii: nano10101899. doi: 10.3390/nano10101899.,,"['18-33-20209/Russian Foundation for Basic Research', 'MK-2278.2019.4/Council on grants of the President of the Russian Federation', 'CTQ-2017-85224-P/Ministerio de Economia, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de', 'Espana', 'Consortium NANODENDMED-II-CM (B2017/BMD-3703)/Ministerio de Economia, Industria y', 'Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana', 'IMMUNOTHERCAN-CM (B2017/BMD3733)/Ministerio de Economia, Industria y', 'Competitividad, Gobierno de Espana', '844217/H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions', 'CA 17140 ""Cancer Nanomedicine from the Bench to the Bedside""/European Cooperation', 'in Science and Technology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many patients do not achieve complete remission and suffer from development of resistance upon treatment with these small molecule inhibitors. Here we report that the TNF family member B-cell activating factor (BAFF) mediates resistance of CLL cells to idelalisib, ibrutinib and venetoclax by sustaining survival and preventing apoptosis of the malignant B cells as revealed by analysis of cellular ATP levels and mitochondrial membrane integrity as well as caspase activation, respectively. As BAFF also plays a prominent role in autoimmune diseases, the BAFF-neutralizing antibody belimumab was developed and approved for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). When we employed belimumab in the context of CLL treatment with idelalisib, ibrutinib and venetoclax, BAFF neutralization was found to significantly increase the sensitivity of the leukemic cells to all three small molecule inhibitors. Notably, BAFF neutralization proved to be beneficial independently of clinical stage according to Binet and Rai or IgVH mutational status. Our results identify drug repurposing of belimumab for neutralization of BAFF to complement small molecule inhibitor treatment as a promising therapeutic approach in CLL that is presently undergoing clinical evaluation.","['Tandler, Claudia', 'Schmidt, Moritz', 'Heitmann, Jonas S', 'Hierold, Julia', 'Schmidt, Jonas', 'Schneider, Pascal', 'Dorfel, Daniela', 'Walz, Juliane', 'Salih, Helmut R']","['Tandler C', 'Schmidt M', 'Heitmann JS', 'Hierold J', 'Schmidt J', 'Schneider P', 'Dorfel D', 'Walz J', 'Salih HR']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6719-1847'],"['Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne, 1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', ""DFG Cluster of Excellence 2180 'Image-Guided and Functional Instructed Tumor Therapy' (iFIT), Eberhard Karls University, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany."", 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', ""DFG Cluster of Excellence 2180 'Image-Guided and Functional Instructed Tumor Therapy' (iFIT), Eberhard Karls University, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200923,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7598196,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell activating factor', 'BAFF', 'belimumab', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'ibrutinib', 'idelalisib', 'venetoclax']",2020/09/27 06:00,2020/09/27 06:01,['2020/09/26 01:00'],"['2020/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/26 01:00 [entrez]', '2020/09/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/27 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12102725 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12102725 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Sep 23;12(10). pii: cancers12102725. doi: 10.3390/cancers12102725.,,"['EXC 2180-390900677, SA1360/7-3/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', '2017.100.2/Wilhelm Sander-Stiftung', '70112914, 70113999, 111828/Deutsche Krebshilfe', '31003A_176256/Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen', 'Forschung']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study presents antitumor activity of newly synthesized chalcone analogues with a methoxy group on a panel of canine lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. The antiproliferative effect of the 2'-hydroxychalcone and its methoxylated derivatives was evaluated in MTT assay after 48 h of treatment in different concentrations. The proapoptotic activity was studied by cytometric analysis of cells stained with Annexin V/FITC and propidium iodide and by measure caspases 3/7 and 8 activation. The DNA damage was evaluated by Western blot analysis of phosphorylated histone H2AX. The new compounds had selective antiproliferative activity against the studied cell lines, the most effective were the 2'-hydroxy-2'',5''-dimethoxychalcone and 2'-hydroxy-4',6'-dimethoxychalcone. 2'-Hydroxychalcone and the two most active derivatives induced apoptosis and caspases participation, but some percentage of necrotic cells was also observed. Comparing phosphatidylserine externalization after treatment with the different compounds it was noted that the addition of two methoxy groups increased the proapoptotic potential. The most active compounds triggered DNA damage even in the cell lines resistant to chalcone-induced apoptosis. The results confirmed that the analogues could have anticancer potential in the treatment of canine lymphoma or leukemia.","['Pawlak, Aleksandra', 'Henklewska, Marta', 'Hernandez Suarez, Beatriz', 'Luzny, Mateusz', 'Kozlowska, Ewa', 'Obminska-Mrukowicz, Bozena', 'Janeczko, Tomasz']","['Pawlak A', 'Henklewska M', 'Hernandez Suarez B', 'Luzny M', 'Kozlowska E', 'Obminska-Mrukowicz B', 'Janeczko T']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7449-1661', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9725-7969', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5377-6609', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0646-2295', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7366-8608', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9757-6684']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, C.K.

Knowledge of LEF1 expression in Hodgkin lymphoma is limited. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to survey LEF1 expression in various subsets of Hodgkin lymphoma, de novo classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) (n = 43), Hodgkin lymphoma associated with Richter syndrome (HL-RS) (n = 20), and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) (n = 9). LEF1 expression was significantly higher in HL-RS compared with de novo CHL (12/20, 60% vs. 12/43, 28%; p = 0.0248). Only a single case (1/9; 11%) of NLPHL showed LEF1 expression. Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA (EBER) was detected in 17 (40%) cases of de novo CHL and 14 (70%) HL-RS. Notably, we identified a correlation between LEF1 expression and EBER positivity (p = 0.0488). We concluded that LEF1 is commonly positive in CHL but not in NLPHL, and such a distinction may be helpful in this differential diagnosis. The higher frequency of LEF1 upregulation in HL-RS relative to de novo CHL suggests that these neoplasms might have different underlying pathogenic mechanisms and warrants further investigation.","['Lyapichev, Kirill A', 'Sakhdari, Ali', 'Khoury, Joseph D', ""O'Malley, Dennis P"", 'El Hussein, Siba', 'Yin, Cameron C', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Thakral, Beenu', 'Young, Ken H', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Konoplev, Sergej']","['Lyapichev KA', 'Sakhdari A', 'Khoury JD', ""O'Malley DP"", 'El Hussein S', 'Yin CC', 'Patel KP', 'Thakral B', 'Young KH', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Konoplev S']",,"['Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Hematopathology, University of Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; NeoGenomics, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Pathology and Hematopathology Division, Duke University School of Medicine, Duke Medical Center and Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

Here, we discuss the general principles, revelations, and applications of reading the BCR immunome in the context of CLL. First, IGHV mutational status, obtained by measuring the mutational imprint on the IGHV gene of the CLL clonotype, is the cornerstone of CLL risk stratification. Furthermore, the discovery of ""BCR-stereotyped"" groups of unrelated patients that share not only a highly similar BCR on their leukemic clone, but also certain clinical characteristics has provided insights key to understanding disease ontogeny. Additionally, whereas the BCR repertoire of most CLL patients is characterized by a single dominant rearrangement, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revealed a rich subclonal landscape in a larger than previously expected proportion of CLL patients. We review the mechanisms underlying these ""multiple dominant"" cases, including V(D)J-recombination errors, failure of allelic exclusion, intraclonal diversification, and ""true"" bi- or oligoclonality, and their implications, in detail. Finally, BCR repertoire sequencing can be used for sensitive quantification of minimal residual disease to potentially unprecedented depth. To surmount pitfalls inherent to this approach and develop internationally harmonized protocols, the EuroClonality-NGS Working Group has been established.","['Hengeveld, Paul J', 'Levin, Mark-David', 'Kolijn, P Martijn', 'Langerak, Anton W']","['Hengeveld PJ', 'Levin MD', 'Kolijn PM', 'Langerak AW']",,"['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Department of Internal Medicine, Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Albert Schweitzer Hospital, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

We hypothesised that IFNlambda4 could play a role in infection clearance or alloreactivity in patients with acute leukaemia who received a myeloablative 10/10 HLA-matched haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). Therefore, we aimed to assess the association between recipient and donor IFNL4 genotype with post-HSCT survival outcomes in patients with acute leukaemia. METHODS: We did a two-stage retrospective cohort study using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) repository and database, in which nearly all patients underwent the procedure in the USA. We included patients with acute myeloid leukaemia or acute lymphocytic leukaemia, who received a HSCT at any age from an unrelated 10/10 HLA-matched donor, with a myeloablative conditioning regimen, between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2008, and had a pre-HSCT recipient or donor blood sample available. The discovery dataset included patients from an existing National Cancer Institute (NCI) cohort of the CIBMTR database, in which donor and recipient IFNL4 polymorphisms (rs368234815, rs12979860, and rs117648444) were genotyped with TaqMan assays. According to their genotype, donors and recipients were categorised into IFNL4-positive, if they had at least one copy of the allele that supports the production of IFNlambda4, or IFNL4-null for the analyses. The findings were independently validated with patients from the DISCOVeRY-BMT cohort (validation dataset) with existing Illumina array genotype data. We also did a combined analysis using data from patients included in both the NCI and DISCOVeRY-BMT cohorts. FINDINGS: We assessed 404 patients (who had a HSCT from Jan 9, 2004, to Dec 26, 2008) in the discovery dataset and 1245 patients in the validation dataset (HSCT Jan 7, 2000, to Dec 26, 2008). The combined analysis included 1593 overlapping participants in both cohorts. Donor, but not recipient IFNL4-positive genotype was associated with increased risk of non-relapse mortality (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.23-2.10; p=0.0005 in the discovery dataset; 1.22, 1.05-1.40; p=0.0072 in the validation dataset; and 1.27, 1.12-1.45; p=0.0001 in the combined dataset). Associations with post-HSCT overall survival were as follows: HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51; p=0.034 in the discovery dataset; 1.10, 0.98-1.20; p=0.10 in the validation dataset; and 1.11, 1.02-1.22; p=0.018 in the combined dataset. INTERPRETATION: Prioritising HSCT donors with the IFNL4-null genotype might decrease non-relapse mortality and improve overall survival without substantially limiting the donor pool. If these findings are validated, IFNL4 genotype could be added to the donor selection algorithm. FUNDING: The National Cancer Institute Intramural Research Program.

Thereafter, no such studies have been conducted. Recently, we conducted a nationwide hospital survey using the method of the 1980s studies, collected baseline data on 996 ATL patients diagnosed in 2010-2011 from 126 hospitals, and reported their unique epidemiological characteristics. Here, we report the follow-up results of registered ATL patients with the goal of evaluating current prognoses and treatment modalities as of 2016-2017. Of 770 evaluable patients, 391 (50.8%) had acute-type, 192 (24.9%) had lymphoma-type, 106 (13.8%) had chronic-type, and 81 (10.5%) had smoldering-type ATL. The initial therapy regimens used for acute/lymphoma-type ATL were vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone, followed by doxorubicin, ranimustine, and prednisone and then by vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisone (VCAP-AMP-VECP)-like in 38.5/41.7% and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP)-like in 14.6/13.7% of patients. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was used to treat 15.9/10.4% of acute/lymphoma-type ATL patients. The 4-year survival rates (the median survival time, days) for acute-, lymphoma-, unfavorable chronic-, favorable chronic-, and smoldering-type ATL were 16.8% (252), 19.6% (305), 26.6% (572), 62.1% (1937), and 59.8% (1851), respectively. The 4-year survival rates for acute- and lymphoma-type ATL improved compared with those reported in 1991, but those for chronic- and smoldering-type ATL were not. Further efforts are warranted to develop more efficient therapeutic strategies to improve the prognosis of ATL in Japan.","['Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Nosaka, Kisato', 'Ishitsuka, Kenji', 'Ishizawa, Kenichi', 'Ito, Shigeki', 'Amano, Masahiro', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Uike, Naokuni', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Tokura, Yoshiki', 'Tobinai, Kensei', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro']","['Imaizumi Y', 'Iwanaga M', 'Nosaka K', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Ishizawa K', 'Ito S', 'Amano M', 'Ishida T', 'Uike N', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Ohshima K', 'Tanaka J', 'Tokura Y', 'Tobinai K', 'Watanabe T', 'Uchimaru K', 'Tsukasaki K']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2954-5691', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1148-6192', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6682-2451', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7030-497X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1060-0777']","['Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Kagoshima University Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Third Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Yamagata University, Yamagata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Iwate Medical University, Iwate, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', ""Department of Hospice care, St. Mary's hospital, Kurume, Japan."", 'Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Woman's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Dermatology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Practical Management of Medical Information, St. Marianna University Graduate School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, International Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20201021,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'RYH2T97J77 (ranimustine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys/statistics & numerical data', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitals/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/classification/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Vindesine/administration & dosage']",PMC7734015,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HTLV-1', 'Japanese nationwide survey', 'clinical subtypes', 'prognosis']",2020/09/26 06:00,2020/12/30 06:00,['2020/09/25 17:13'],"['2020/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/25 17:13 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14658 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2020 Dec;111(12):4567-4580. doi: 10.1111/cas.14658.

IRX4204 is a novel, highly specific RXR agonist in clinical trials that potently and selectively activates RXR homodimers, but not heterodimers. In this study, in vivo IRX4204 compared favorably with FK506 in abrogating acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which was associated with inhibiting allogeneic donor T-cell proliferation, reducing T-helper 1 differentiation, and promoting regulatory T-cell (Treg) generation. Recipient IRX4204 treatment reduced intestinal injury and decreased IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha serum levels. Transcriptional analysis of donor T cells isolated from intestines of GVHD mice treated with IRX4204 revealed significant decreases in transcripts regulating proinflammatory pathways. In vitro, inducible Treg differentiation from naive CD4+ T cells was enhanced by IRX4204. In vivo, IRX4204 increased the conversion of donor Foxp3- T cells into peripheral Foxp3+ Tregs in GVHD mice. Using Foxp3 lineage-tracer mice in which both the origin and current FoxP3 expression of Tregs can be tracked, we demonstrated that IRX4204 supports Treg stability. Despite favoring Tregs and reducing Th1 differentiation, IRX4204-treated recipients maintained graft-versus-leukemia responses against both leukemia and lymphoma cells. Notably, IRX4204 reduced in vitro human T-cell proliferation and enhanced Treg generation in mixed lymphocyte reaction cultures. Collectively, these beneficial effects indicate that targeting RXRs with IRX4204 could be a novel approach to preventing acute GVHD in the clinic.","['Thangavelu, Govindarajan', 'Wang, Chao', 'Loschi, Michael', 'Saha, Asim', 'Osborn, Mark J', 'Furlan, Scott N', 'Aoyama, Kazutoshi', 'McDonald-Hyman, Cameron', 'Aguilar, Ethan G', 'Janesick, Amanda S', 'Chandraratna, Roshantha A', 'Refaeli, Yosef', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, Angela', 'MacDonald, Kelli P', 'Hill, Geoffrey R', 'Zeiser, Robert', 'Maillard, Ivan', 'Serody, Jonathan S', 'Murphy, William J', 'Munn, David H', 'Blumberg, Bruce', 'Brown, Chrysothemis', 'Kuchroo, Vijay', 'Kean, Leslie S', 'Hippen, Keli L', 'Noelle, Randolph J', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['Thangavelu G', 'Wang C', 'Loschi M', 'Saha A', 'Osborn MJ', 'Furlan SN', 'Aoyama K', 'McDonald-Hyman C', 'Aguilar EG', 'Janesick AS', 'Chandraratna RA', 'Refaeli Y', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'MacDonald KP', 'Hill GR', 'Zeiser R', 'Maillard I', 'Serody JS', 'Murphy WJ', 'Munn DH', 'Blumberg B', 'Brown C', 'Kuchroo V', 'Kean LS', 'Hippen KL', 'Noelle RJ', 'Blazar BR']",,"['Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', ""Evergrande Center for Immunologic Diseases, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', ""Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA."", 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Department of Developmental and Cell Biology, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA.', 'Io Therapeutics, Santa Ana, CA.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Department of Immunology, Queensland Institute of Medical Research (QIMR), University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Clinical Research Division and.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, Sacramento, CA.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA.', 'Department of Developmental and Cell Biology, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA.', ""Division of Transplantation Immunology and Mucosal Biology, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""Evergrande Center for Immunologic Diseases, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA;

We evaluated clinicoepidemiologic profiles and outcomes of MPAL. METHODS: Records of children younger than 15 years of age with acute leukemia from January 2010 to December 2016 were reviewed on the basis of the MPAL WHO 2008 criteria. Treatment was uniform with a modified MCP-841 protocol. Descriptive analysis tools were used. Outcomes were measured by the Kaplan-Meier method on MedCalc, version 14.8.1. RESULTS: Among 3830 children with acute leukemia in the study period, 2892 received treatment from our center, of whom 24 (0.83%) had MPAL, median age 9 years, with a male:female ratio of 3:1, and median white blood cell of 13.4x10/L. Common immunophenotypes were B/myeloid-12 (50%), T/myeloid-9 (37.5%), and B/T-lymphoid-3 (12.5%). Some B/myeloid cases had abnormal cytogenetics. Seventeen patients were evaluable for outcome. Sixteen patients underwent postinduction bone marrow and 13 (81%) achieved morphologic remission. Thirteen patients underwent flow cytometry-based minimal residual disease evaluation; 9 (69%) were <0.01% (4 postinduction, 5 postconsolidation), and 67% of these had sustained remission till the last follow-up. None underwent bone marrow transplant. The projected 3-year event-free and overall survival rates were 40% and 48%, respectively (median follow-up: 22 mo). CONCLUSION: MPAL represented <1% of childhood acute leukemia. acute lymphoblastic leukemia-type chemotherapy that incorporated high-dose cytarabine was effective in achieving an minimal residual disease-negativity rate of 69% in evaluated patients, which was also predictive of better outcome.","['Myint, Htar H', 'Tandon, Sneha', 'Narula, Gaurav', 'Prasad, Maya', 'Subramanian, Papagudi', 'Patkar, Nikhil', 'Tembhare, Prashant', 'Gujral, Sumeet', 'Banavali, Shripad']","['Myint HH', 'Tandon S', 'Narula G', 'Prasad M', 'Subramanian P', 'Patkar N', 'Tembhare P', 'Gujral S', 'Banavali S']",,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Mandalay Children Hospital, Mandalay, Myanmar.', 'Departments of Pediatric Oncology.', 'Departments of Pediatric Oncology.', 'Departments of Pediatric Oncology.', 'Pathology, Tata Memorial Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Pathology, Tata Memorial Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Pathology, Tata Memorial Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Pathology, Tata Memorial Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Departments of Pediatric Oncology.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",,,,2020/09/26 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/09/25 17:11'],"['2020/09/25 17:11 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001880 [doi]', '00043426-202010000-00001 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Oct;42(7):415-419. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001880.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long non-coding RNAs are being found to have relevance to the pathogenesis of pediatric T-ALL. However, the function of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B anti-sense RNA 1 (CDKN2B-AS1) in pediatric T-ALL progression and chemoresistance has not been illuminated. The levels of CDKN2B-AS1, miR-335-3p and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 5 (TRAF5) were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Cell proliferation and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value were detected using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetr -azolium assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was performed to measure protein expression. Targeted interactions among CDKN2B-AS1, miR-335-3p and TRAF5 were determined by the dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Animal studies were conducted to observe the function of CDKN2B-AS1 in vivo. Our data indicated that CDKN2B-AS1 was highly expressed in pediatric T-ALL peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cells, and high CDKN2B-AS1 level was associated with adriamycin (ADR) resistance. CDKN2B-AS1 depletion hindered T-ALL/ADR cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, and promoted cell apoptosis and ADR sensitivity in vitro. Moreover, CDKN2B-AS1 knockdown repressed tumor growth and enhanced ADR sensitivity in vivo. CDKN2B-AS1 sequestered miR-335-3p, and CDKN2B-AS1 depletion exerted regulatory effect in T-ALL/ADR cell progression by up-regulating miR-335-3p. TRAF5 was a direct target of miR-335-3p, and TRAF5 mediated the regulation of miR-335-3p in T-ALL cell behaviors. Furthermore, CDKN2B-AS1 positively modulated TRAF5 expression through sponging miR-335-3p. The current work suggested that CDKN2B-AS1 knockdown repressed the progression and enhanced ADR sensitivity of pediatric T-ALL at least partly through targeting miR-335-3p/TRAF5 axis, highlighting a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of pediatric T-ALL patients.","['Chen, Longfeng', 'Shi, Yanxiang', 'Li, Jing', 'Yang, Xinli', 'Li, Ruiyan', 'Zhou, Xiaohong', 'Zhu, Lanjie']","['Chen L', 'Shi Y', 'Li J', 'Yang X', 'Li R', 'Zhou X', 'Zhu L']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, Juxian People's Hospital, Rizhao."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Juxian People's Hospital, Rizhao."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Tai An TSCM Hospital.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Taian City Central Hospital, Taian, Shandong, China.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Juxian People's Hospital, Rizhao."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Juxian People's Hospital, Rizhao."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Juxian People's Hospital, Rizhao.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200925,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,,IM,,,,,2020/09/26 06:00,2020/09/26 06:00,['2020/09/25 17:10'],"['2020/09/25 17:10 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000001001 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Anticancer Drugs. 2020 Sep 25. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000001001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IDO is the rate-limiting step in tryptophan metabolism catabolism into its byproducts - kynurenines. Both IDO and kynurenines have been implicated in altering the tumor microenvironment, allowing for a tolerogenesis by affecting T-cell maturation and proliferation, and more specifically by inducing differentiation into T regulatory cells. Two mechanisms have been suspected in creating this environment: tryptophan starvation and metabolite toxicity. IDO has been shown to be expressed not only in cancer cells but also in antigen-presenting cells. The exact mechanisms underlying the two different sites of expression have not been fully elucidated. To date, most literature has focused on the role of IDO in solid tumors; we provide a review of IDO and its impact on hematological malignancies - more specifically, acute myeloid leukemia. The pathophysiology of IDO will be discussed, including a summarization of the literature to date on how IDO expression effects prognosis and disease progression in acute myeloid leukemia, along with current IDO-specific therapeutics with future considerations.","['Sobash, Philip T', 'Kolhe, Ravindra', 'Karim, Nagla Abdel', 'Guddati, Achuta K', 'Jillella, Anand', 'Kota, Vamsi']","['Sobash PT', 'Kolhe R', 'Karim NA', 'Guddati AK', 'Jillella A', 'Kota V']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9711-604X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8283-0240', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5112-5100', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9390-0424', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6279-7567', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5290-9289']","['Internal Medicine, White River Health System, Batesville, AR 72501, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, Augusta University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200925,England,Future Oncol,"Future oncology (London, England)",101256629,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (IDO1 protein, human)', '0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)', '343-65-7 (Kynurenine)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/enzymology/immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kynurenine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/immunology', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/metabolism', 'Tryptophan/metabolism', 'Tumor Escape/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects/*immunology', 'Up-Regulation/immunology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['3-dioxygenase', 'T cells', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cancer', 'immunity', 'immunosuppression', 'indoleamine-2', 'kynurenines', 'metabolism', 'tolerance', 'tumor microenvironment']",2020/09/26 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2020/09/25 17:09'],"['2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/25 17:09 [entrez]']",['10.2217/fon-2019-0642 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Oncol. 2020 Dec;16(36):3085-3094. doi: 10.2217/fon-2019-0642.

The majority of these mutations are internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3, which have been validated as a therapeutic target. The clinical success of selective inhibitors targeting oncogenic FLT3, however, has been limited due to the acquisition of drug resistance. Herein the identification of a dual FLT3/microtubule polymerization inhibitor, chalcone 4 (2'-allyloxy-4,4'-dimethoxychalcone), is reported through screening of 15 related chalcones for differential antiproliferative activity in leukemia cell lines dependent on FLT3-ITD (MV-4-11) or BCR-ABL (K562) oncogenes and by subsequent screening for mitotic inducers in the HCT116 cell line. Three natural chalcones (1-3) were found to be differentially more potent toward the MV-4-11 (FLT3-ITD) cell line compared to the K562 (BCR-ABL) cell line. Notably, the new semisynthetic chalcone 4, which is a 2'-O-allyl analogue of the natural chalcone 3, was found to be more potent toward the FLT3-ITD+ cell line and inhibited FLT3 signaling in FLT3-dependent cells. An in vitro kinase assay confirmed that chalcone 4 directly inhibited FLT3. Moreover, chalcone 4 induced mitotic arrest in these cells and inhibited tubulin polymerization in both cellular and biochemical assays. Treatment of MV-4-11 cells with this inhibitor for 24 and 48 h resulted in apoptotic cell death. Finally, chalcone 4 was able to overcome TKD mutation-mediated acquired resistance to FLT3 inhibitors in a MOLM-13 cell line expressing FLT3-ITD with the D835Y mutation. Chalcone 4 is, therefore, a promising lead for the discovery of dual-target FLT3 inhibitors.","['Malik, Haleema Sadia', 'Bilal, Aishah', 'Ullah, Rahim', 'Iqbal, Maheen', 'Khan, Sardraz', 'Ahmed, Ishtiaq', 'Krohn, Karsten', 'Saleem, Rahman Shah Zaib', 'Hussain, Hidayat', 'Faisal, Amir']","['Malik HS', 'Bilal A', 'Ullah R', 'Iqbal M', 'Khan S', 'Ahmed I', 'Krohn K', 'Saleem RSZ', 'Hussain H', 'Faisal A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9615-4471', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8654-8127', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7376-8286']","['Department of Biology, Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Department of Biology, Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Department of Biology, Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Department of Biology, Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Paderborn, Warburger Strasse 100, 33098 Paderborn, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Paderborn, Warburger Strasse 100, 33098 Paderborn, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Paderborn, Warburger Strasse 100, 33098 Paderborn, Germany.', 'Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Weinberg 3, D-06120 Halle (Saale), Germany.', 'Department of Biology, Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200925,United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chalcones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Microtubules/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Polymerization', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",,,,2020/09/26 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2020/09/25 17:09'],"['2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/25 17:09 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c00699 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2020 Oct 23;83(10):3111-3121. doi: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.0c00699.

The steady-state level of SO2 (Cysteine sulfinic acid, Cys-SO2H) form for peroxiredoxin 3 (PRX3) was measured by a western blot. To evaluate the effect of sulfiredoxin 1 depletion, NB4 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA and analyzed for their influence on ROS, redox enzymes, and apoptosis. The mitochondrial ROS of NB4 cells significantly increased after ATO treatment. NB4 cell apoptosis after ATO treatment increased in a time-dependent manner. Increased SO2 form and dimeric PRX3 were observed as a hyperoxidation reaction in NB4 cells post-ATO treatment, in concordance with mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Sulfiredoxin 1 expression is downregulated by small interfering RNA transfection, which potentiated mitochondrial ROS generation and cell growth arrest in ATO-treated NB4 cells. Our results indicate that ATO-induced ROS generation in APL cell mitochondria is attributable to PRX3 hyperoxidation as well as dimerized PRX3 accumulation, subsequently triggering apoptosis. The downregulation of sulfiredoxin 1 could amplify apoptosis in ATO-treated APL cells.","['Mun, Yeung-Chul', 'Ahn, Jee Young', 'Yoo, Eun Sun', 'Lee, Kyoung Eun', 'Nam, Eun Mi', 'Huh, Jungwon', 'Woo, Hyun Ae', 'Rhee, Sue Goo', 'Seong, Chu Myong']","['Mun YC', 'Ahn JY', 'Yoo ES', 'Lee KE', 'Nam EM', 'Huh J', 'Woo HA', 'Rhee SG', 'Seong CM']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1882-3983', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9813-0481', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6419-2337', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1596-8666', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0108-5352', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8758-9847', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3483-1203', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4740-4956', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9985-9218']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07985, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07985, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07985, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07985, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07985, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07985, Korea.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul 03760, Korea.', 'Yonsei Biomedical Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 03722, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul 07985, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxin III)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Peroxiredoxin III/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Transfection']",PMC7528683,['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'arsenic trioxide', 'peroxiredoxin 3']",2020/09/26 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/09/25 08:36'],"['2019/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 08:36 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['molcells.2020.2234 [pii]', '10.14348/molcells.2020.2234 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 2020 Sep 30;43(9):813-820. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2020.2234.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, splenic and bone marrow aspiration remain two gold standard methods for microscopic identification of Leishmania donovani (LD) bodies and confirmatory diagnosis of VL. Five patients with signs and symptoms of fever, loss of appetite, loss of weight, hepatomegaly, and massive splenomegaly were found to be false positive with the rK39 RDT. These patients were suspected to have chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) because their blood pictures showed a total white blood cell count of > 100,000/mm(3) and abnormal cells such as stab, segmented promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and blast cells. Splenic aspirate and bone marrow were negative for Leishmania donovani bodies. The bone marrow showed myeloid series of cells, that is, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, stab and segmented cells, blast cells, and markedly increased myeloid:erythroid ratio. Later, the CML diagnosis was confirmed in all cases by breakpoint cluster region-tyrosine protein kinase (BCR-ABL) gene positive test results. In this study, the rK39 RDT's false positivity was observed in CML cases. It could have important implications for the differential diagnosis of VL with CML. The rK39 positive test result in CML cases was a serendipitous occurrence; this should be validated further to determine the utility of the rK39 test in the differential diagnosis of VL with CML.","['Topno, Roshan Kamal', 'Madhukar, Major', 'Pandey, Krishna', 'Kumar, Rishikesh', 'Rabidas, Vidya Nand', 'Kumar, Maneesh', 'Agrawal, Kanhaiya', 'Verma, Neena', 'Yadav, Devendra Prasad', 'Bimal, Sanjeeva', 'Siddiqui, Niyamat Ali', 'Das, Pradeep']","['Topno RK', 'Madhukar M', 'Pandey K', 'Kumar R', 'Rabidas VN', 'Kumar M', 'Agrawal K', 'Verma N', 'Yadav DP', 'Bimal S', 'Siddiqui NA', 'Das P']",,"['Department of Epidemiology, ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India.', 'Department of Biostatistics, ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India.', 'Department of Virology, ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India.', 'Department of Pathology, ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India.', 'Central Diagnostic Laboratory, ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India.', 'Department of Immunology, ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India.', 'Department of Biostatistics, ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, ICMR-Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200917,United States,Am J Trop Med Hyg,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,0370507,"['0 (Antibodies, Protozoan)', '0 (Antigens, Protozoan)', '0 (Protozoan Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Protozoan/*blood', 'Antigens, Protozoan/*immunology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diagnostic Tests, Routine', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Humans', 'India', 'Leishmania donovani/*immunology', 'Leishmaniasis/*diagnosis/parasitology', 'Leishmaniasis, Visceral/*diagnosis/parasitology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Protozoan Proteins/*immunology']",PMC7695053,,,2020/09/26 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/09/25 08:36'],"['2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/25 08:36 [entrez]']",['10.4269/ajtmh.20-0301 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2020 Dec;103(6):2257-2259. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.20-0301.

The advent of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has transformed the treatment of relapsed/refractory ALL. The most well-studied, successful CARs are autologous, murine-based anti-CD19 CARs, but new constructs are currently under clinical investigation. AREAS COVERED: This review describes the history and design of CAR T cells, clinical trial outcomes of anti-CD19 and newer CARs, treatment-related toxicities including cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, and issues with resistance and relapse. A search of PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov spanning from 2012-present was used to select original reports investigating the use of CAR T in pediatric patients. EXPERT OPINION: CD19-targeted CARs have demonstrated remarkable response rates and produced durable remissions in very high-risk pediatric patient populations. The therapies, however, are limited by unique treatment-related toxicities and considerable rates of antigen-positive and antigen-negative relapses. Current research efforts focused on elucidating mechanisms of resistance/relapse and on developing strategies to prevent and treat relapse are critical to optimizing the use of CAR-T. In addition, ongoing trials testing CARs earlier in therapy and for new indications are key to informing their widespread usage.","['Myers, Regina M', 'Dolan, Joseph', 'Teachey, David T']","['Myers RM', 'Dolan J', 'Teachey DT']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2542-2061', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7373-8987']","[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Expert Rev Clin Immunol,Expert review of clinical immunology,101271248,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', 'Q6C9WHR03O (tisagenlecleucel)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytokine Release Syndrome/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC7905709,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*adoptive T cell therapy', '*car T cell', '*cd19', '*chimeric antigen receptor', '*cytokine release syndrome', '*immunotherapy', '*tisagenlecleucel']",2020/09/26 06:00,2020/09/26 06:00,['2020/09/25 08:36'],"['2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/25 08:36 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1744666X.2021.1828067 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Clin Immunol. 2020 Oct;16(10):1029-1042. doi: 10.1080/1744666X.2021.1828067.,,"['K12 CA076931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA193776/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233249/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['NIHMS1664515'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed to improve FLT3-mutated AML patient s survival. Gilteritinib, a highly specific second-generation class I oral FLT3 inhibitor, has demonstrated superiority to salvage chemotherapy (SC) in R/R FLT3 mutated AML based on significantly longer OS in the gilteritinib arm than in the SC arm. Gilteritinib is generally well tolerated, but some clinically relevant adverse events should be monitored, especially myelosuppression, QTc prolongation and differentiation syndrome, usually manageable (dose reductions, interruption or discontinuation) and reversible.

Exposure-efficacy analysis showed that the survival benefit of glasdegib was not glasdegib exposure-dependent. The relationship between glasdegib exposure and adverse event (AE) cluster terms of clinical concern was explored in this analysis. The incidence and severity of dysgeusia, muscle spasms, renal toxicity, and QT interval prolonged was modeled using ordinal logistic regression. AEs were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters were used to derive glasdegib exposure metrics. Demographic characteristics, disease factors, and other variables of interest as potential moderators of safety signals were evaluated. Clinical trial data from patients who received single-agent glasdegib (N = 70; 5-640 mg once daily); or glasdegib (N = 202, 100-200 mg once daily) with low-dose cytarabine, decitabine, or daunorubicin and cytarabine were analyzed. Glasdegib exposure was statistically significantly associated with the cluster term safety end points dysgeusia, muscle spasms, renal toxicity, and QT interval prolonged. The impact of age on muscle spasms and baseline body weight and creatinine clearance on renal toxicity helped explain the AE grade distribution. At the 100 mg once daily clinical dose, the predicted probabilities of the highest AE grade were 11.3%, 6.7%, 7.7%, and 2.5% for dysgeusia, muscle spasms, renal toxicity, and QT interval prolonged, respectively. Overall, the predicted probability of developing an AE of any severity for these safety end points was low. Therefore, no starting dose adjustments are recommended for glasdegib based on the observed safety profile.","['Ruiz-Garcia, Ana', 'Shaik, Naveed', 'Lin, Swan', 'Jamieson, Catriona', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Chan, Geoffrey']","['Ruiz-Garcia A', 'Shaik N', 'Lin S', 'Jamieson C', 'Heuser M', 'Chan G']",,"['Pfizer Clinical Pharmacology, San Diego, California, USA.', 'Pfizer Clinical Pharmacology, San Diego, California, USA.', 'Pfizer Clinical Pharmacology, San Diego, California, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Pfizer Oncology, Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200924,England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', 'K673DMO5H9 (glasdegib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Benzimidazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Rate']",PMC7891441,['NOTNLM'],"['*PK/PD', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*exposure-response', '*hedgehog signaling', '*safety', '*smoothened inhibitor']",2020/09/26 06:00,2021/12/16 06:00,['2020/09/25 06:08'],"['2020/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/25 06:08 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcph.1742 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2021 Mar;61(3):349-359. doi: 10.1002/jcph.1742.

Here, we report the crystal structure of CD53 in an open conformation poised for partner interaction. The large extracellular domain (EC2) of CD53 protrudes away from the membrane surface and exposes a variable region, which is identified by hydrogen-deuterium exchange as the common interface for CD53 and CD81 to bind partners. The EC2 orientation in CD53 is supported by an extracellular loop (EC1). At the closed conformation of CD81, however, EC2 disengages from EC1 and rotates toward the membrane, thereby preventing partner interaction. Structural simulation shows that EC1-EC2 interaction also supports the open conformation of CD81. Disrupting this interaction in CD81 impairs the accurate glycosylation of its CD19 partner, the target for leukemia immunotherapies. Moreover, EC1 mutations in CD53 prevent the chemotaxis of pre-B cells toward a chemokine that supports B-cell trafficking and homing within the bone marrow, a major CD53 function identified here. Overall, an open conformation is required for tetraspanin-partner interactions to support myriad cellular processes.","['Yang, Yihu', 'Liu, Xiaoran Roger', 'Greenberg, Zev J', 'Zhou, Fengbo', 'He, Peng', 'Fan, Lingling', 'Liu, Shixuan', 'Shen, Guomin', 'Egawa, Takeshi', 'Gross, Michael L', 'Schuettpelz, Laura G', 'Li, Weikai']","['Yang Y', 'Liu XR', 'Greenberg ZJ', 'Zhou F', 'He P', 'Fan L', 'Liu S', 'Shen G', 'Egawa T', 'Gross ML', 'Schuettpelz LG', 'Li W']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3198-1588', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3886-144X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5006-2790', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8711-1904']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200816,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD19 antigen, mouse)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (CD53 protein, human)', '0 (CD81 protein, human)', '0 (Cd53 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cd81 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tetraspanin 25)', '0 (Tetraspanin 28)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Movement', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Protein Domains', '*Tetraspanin 25/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Tetraspanin 28/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7507038,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD19', '*CD53', '*CD81', '*cell migration', '*tetraspanin']",2020/09/26 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/09/25 06:07'],"['2020/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:07 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.15252/embj.2020105246 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2020 Sep 15;39(18):e105246. doi: 10.15252/embj.2020105246.

Whether a lower dose of rasburicase would be equally effective for critically ill children, who often have more complicated situations and a higher risk of hospital death, is still unknown. Objective To explore the safety and efficacy of low-dose rasburicase in critically ill children with haematological malignancies who are at high risk of tumour lysis syndrome. Setting A single-centre retrospective cohort study. Method Children with haematological malignancies who had a history of rasburicase exposure during an intensive care unit stay were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups according to the initial dosage of rasburicase: the standard-dose group (> 0.1 mg/kg/day) and the low-dose group (</= 0.1 mg/kg/day). The adverse events and short-term prognosis of the two groups were compared. Results Thirty-seven children were selected, 22 in the standard-dose group and 15 in the low-dose group. The most common tumour type was Burkitt's lymphoma (81%), followed by acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (11%). All patients were at high risk of tumour lysis syndrome, and 73% of them had 3 or more tumour lysis syndrome risk factors. The uric acid levels of 90% of patients with hyperuricaemia returned to the normal range within 12 h (100% in the standard-dose group and 75% in the low-dose group, P = 0.083). Eighty-four percent of patients presented serious complications, including tumour lysis syndrome (73%), acute kidney injury (59%), renal replacement treatment (24%), respiratory failure (24%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (16%) and heart failure (11%). There was no significant difference in the incidence of serious complications between the two groups. The overall 7-day and 28-day survival rates after intensive care unit admission were 86% and 84%, respectively. The average length of stay in the intensive care unit was 9.92 +/- 5.13 days. Neither the short-term mortality nor the length of stay in the intensive care unit were significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion Low-dose rasburicase is effective and may be an acceptable choice for critically ill children with haematological malignancies.","['Pei, Yuxin', 'Li, Yu', 'Liang, Yujian', 'Xu, Lingling', 'Huang, Xueqiong', 'Li, Yijuan', 'Tang, Wen', 'Jiang, Xiaoyun']","['Pei Y', 'Li Y', 'Liang Y', 'Xu L', 'Huang X', 'Li Y', 'Tang W', 'Jiang X']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5000-8014'],"['The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun-yat, Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun-yat, Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun-yat, Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun-yat, Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun-yat, Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun-yat, Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun-yat, Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun-yat, Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. jiangxiaoyun2015@126.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200924,Netherlands,Int J Clin Pharm,International journal of clinical pharmacy,101554912,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Gout Suppressants)', '08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Critical Illness', 'Female', 'Gout Suppressants/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Hyperuricemia/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Intensive Care Units, Pediatric', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Urate Oxidase/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",PMC7603475,['NOTNLM'],"['Children', 'Haematological malignancies', 'Hyperuricaemia', 'Intensive care unit', 'Rasburicase']",2020/09/26 06:00,2021/07/28 06:00,['2020/09/25 06:07'],"['2020/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/25 06:07 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11096-020-01144-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s11096-020-01144-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Pharm. 2020 Dec;42(6):1440-1446. doi: 10.1007/s11096-020-01144-8.

As bacterial infections are a common cause for treatment-related mortality in these patients, we conducted a retrospective study to analyze the incidence of CDI and to evaluate risk factors for CDI in a large uniformly treated AML cohort. A total of 415 AML patients undergoing intensive induction chemotherapy between 2007 and 2019 were included in this retrospective analysis. Patients presenting with diarrhea and positive stool testing for toxin-producing Clostridioides difficile were defined to have CDI. CDI was diagnosed in 37 (8.9%) of 415 AML patients with decreasing CDI rates between 2013 and 2019 versus 2007 to 2012. Days with fever, exposition to carbapenems, and glycopeptides were significantly associated with CDI in AML patients. Clinical endpoints such as length of hospital stay, admission to ICU, response rates, and survival were not adversely affected. We identified febrile episodes and exposition to carbapenems and glycopeptides as risk factors for CDI in AML patients undergoing induction chemotherapy, thereby highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary antibiotic stewardship programs guiding treatment strategies in AML patients with infectious complications to carefully balance risks and benefits of anti-infective agents.","['Ballo, Olivier', 'Kreisel, Eva-Maria', 'Eladly, Fagr', 'Brunnberg, Uta', 'Stratmann, Jan', 'Hunyady, Peter', 'Hogardt, Michael', 'Wichelhaus, Thomas A', 'Kempf, Volkhard A J', 'Steffen, Bjorn', 'Vehreschild, Joerg J', 'Vehreschild, Maria J G T', 'Finkelmeier, Fabian', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Brandts, Christian H']","['Ballo O', 'Kreisel EM', 'Eladly F', 'Brunnberg U', 'Stratmann J', 'Hunyady P', 'Hogardt M', 'Wichelhaus TA', 'Kempf VAJ', 'Steffen B', 'Vehreschild JJ', 'Vehreschild MJGT', 'Finkelmeier F', 'Serve H', 'Brandts CH']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1634-1988'],"['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60596, Frankfurt/Main, Germany. olivier.ballo@kgu.de.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60596, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60596, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60596, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60596, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, University Hospital, Goethe University, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, Goethe University Hospital, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'University Center for Infectious Diseases, Goethe University Hospital, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'University Center of Competence for Infection Control, Frankfurt -

Inactivation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is essential for CML-quiescent LSC survival and NK cell antitumor activity. Here we show that MIR300 has antiproliferative and PP2A-activating functions that are dose dependently differentially induced by CCND2/CDK6 and SET inhibition, respectively. MIR300 is upregulated in CML LSCs and NK cells by bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) signals to induce quiescence and impair immune response, respectively. Conversely, BCR-ABL1 downregulates MIR300 in CML progenitors to prevent growth arrest and PP2A-mediated apoptosis. Quiescent LSCs escape apoptosis by upregulating TUG1 long noncoding RNA that uncouples and limits MIR300 function to cytostasis. Genetic and pharmacologic MIR300 modulation and/or PP2A-activating drug treatment restore NK cell activity, inhibit BMM-induced growth arrest, and selectively trigger LSC apoptosis in vitro and in patient-derived xenografts; hence, the importance of MIR300 and PP2A activity for CML development and therapy.","['Silvestri, Giovannino', 'Trotta, Rossana', 'Stramucci, Lorenzo', 'Ellis, Justin J', 'Harb, Jason G', 'Neviani, Paolo', 'Wang, Shuzhen', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin', 'Walker, Christopher J', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Srutova, Klara', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Pineda, Gabriel', 'Jamieson, Catriona H M', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Vigneri, Paolo', 'Nteliopoulos, Georgios', 'May, Philippa C', 'Reid, Alistair G', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Roy, Denis-Claude', 'Moutuou, Moutuaata M', 'Guimond, Martin', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Deininger, Michael W', 'Fitzgerald, Garrett', 'Harman, Christopher', 'Dazzi, Francesco', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Qi, Jianfei', 'Polakova, Katerina Machova', 'Zou, Ying', 'Fan, Xiaoxuan', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Calabretta, Bruno', 'Perrotti, Danilo']","['Silvestri G', 'Trotta R', 'Stramucci L', 'Ellis JJ', 'Harb JG', 'Neviani P', 'Wang S', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Walker CJ', 'Zhang B', 'Srutova K', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Pineda G', 'Jamieson CHM', 'Stagno F', 'Vigneri P', 'Nteliopoulos G', 'May PC', 'Reid AG', 'Garzon R', 'Roy DC', 'Moutuou MM', 'Guimond M', 'Hokland P', 'Deininger MW', 'Fitzgerald G', 'Harman C', 'Dazzi F', 'Milojkovic D', 'Apperley JF', 'Marcucci G', 'Qi J', 'Polakova KM', 'Zou Y', 'Fan X', 'Baer MR', 'Calabretta B', 'Perrotti D']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3869-2463'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Molecular Virology Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Molecular Virology Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Molecular Virology Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Molecular Virology Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Molecular Virology Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, University of Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Hematology and Clinical Research Unit, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Health Sciences, School of Health and Human Services, National University, San Diego, California.', 'Department of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California.', 'Division of Hematology and Unit of Medical Oncology, A.O.U.

However, its role in gastric cancer differentiation and the specific pathways involved are unclear. In this study, we found that PTBP3 was upregulated in the poorly differentiated gastric cancer tissues. Patients with high levels of PTBP3 expression had significantly shorter survival than those with low PTBP3 expression. In gastric cancer cells, the regulatory effect of PTBP3 on alternative splicing of the Id1 gene was investigated. Following sodium butyrate-induced differentiation of MKN45 cells, the expression of Id1a decreased, but the expression of Id1b increased. RNA interference and overexpression experiments showed that PTBP3 upregulated Id1a expression and downregulated Id1b expression. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays indicated PTBP3 could interact with Id1. UV cross-linking assays indicated that PTBP3 interacted with the CU rich region of the Id1 gene. Two-hybrid experiments and a gel mobility shift assays found that Id1b had a more potent affinity for Hes1 than Id1a. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays verified the association of Hes1 and the promoter of PTBP3 gene. Luciferase assays revealed that Hes1 bound the N-box sequence in the PTBP3 promoter. After silencing or overexpression of Hes1, PTBP3 protein expression remained unchanged. Thus, the loss of feedback regulation among PTBP3, Id1, and Hes1 in gastric cancer cells may be one of the causes of inhibited differentiation and malignant proliferation of these cells.","['Chen, Bin', 'Chen, Weixia', 'Mu, Xiaoyan', 'Yang, Liyan', 'Gu, Xiangyu', 'Zhao, Aiguang', 'Liang, Xin', 'Liu, Jianwen']","['Chen B', 'Chen W', 'Mu X', 'Yang L', 'Gu X', 'Zhao A', 'Liang X', 'Liu J']",,"['Department of Oncology, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Putuo Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering and Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering and Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Longhua Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering and Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering and Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200818,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7461954,['NOTNLM'],"['Hes1', 'Id1', 'PTBP3', 'alternative splicing', 'gastric cancer']",2020/09/26 06:00,2020/09/26 06:01,['2020/09/25 06:03'],"['2020/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:03 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.01477 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Aug 18;10:1477. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01477. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Chen, Chen, Mu, Yang, Gu, Zhao, Liang and Liu.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early T-cell precursor (ETP) leukemia is a unique subtype of T-ALL. The aim of this study is to compare the differences between ETP and non-ETP ALLs in China. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 122 adult T-ALL patients diagnosed and treated at our center between January 2014 and June 2019. All the patients enrolled were categorized into ETP and non-ETP ALL by immunophenotype, and further statistical analyses about clinical data and prognostic factors were performed. Results: Among the 122 cases, the male-to-female ratio was 2.8:1, and the median age is 29 (range, 16-82) years. Except for 10 patients with insufficient immunophenotyping results, 47.3% (53/112) are ETP and 52.7% (59/112) are non-ETP. Compared with non-ETP patients, ETP-ALL patients had lower white blood cell counts and lactate dehydrogenase levels, while they were older and had higher platelet counts and fibrinogen levels (all p < 0.05). Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 68.0% (83/122) of patients, 64.2 and 76.3% in ETP and non-ETP, respectively (p = 0.160). In total, 44.6% (37/83) of patients relapsed. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) was successfully performed in 36.1% (44/122) of patients, of which 79.5% (35/44) were in CR1. With a median follow-up of 9.1 (range, 0.5-70.3) months, the estimated 2-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) rates for the cohort were 38.0 +/- 5.1 and 39.1 +/- 6.3%, respectively. In the ETP group, the 2-year OS rate was 40.7 +/- 8.2% and the RFS rate was 47.2 +/- 10.7%, while in the non-ETP group, the 2-year OS rate was 37.9 +/- 7.0% and the RFS rate was 39.2 +/- 8.3% (both p > 0.05). In the landmark analysis of CR1 patients who had a survival of more than 6 months, the allo-SCT group had significantly better survival outcomes than the chemotherapy group, and the 2-year OS rates and RFS rates were 80.1 +/- 7.3 vs. 28.4 +/- 8.4% and 68.9 +/- 8.8 vs. 12.8 +/- 7.2%, respectively (both p < 0.0001). A multivariate analysis suggests that allo-SCT acts as an independent prognostic factor for both OS and RFS. Conclusions: Our results revealed that ETP accounted for a high proportion of T-ALL in Chinese. There are no CR rates and prognosis differences between ETP and non-ETP. Allo-SCT in CR1 can significantly improve patients' survival.","['Zhang, Yi', 'Qian, Jie-Jing', 'Zhou, Yi-Le', 'Huang, Xin', 'Li, Jian-Hu', 'Li, Xue-Ying', 'Li, Chen-Ying', 'Wang, Huan-Ping', 'Lou,

The abnormal survival of CLL B cells is explained by a plethora of supportive stimuli produced by the surrounding cells of the microenvironment, including follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). This crosstalk between malignant cells and normal cells can take place directly by cell-to-cell contact (assisted by adhesion molecules such as VLA-4 or CD100), indirectly by soluble factors (chemokines such as CXCL12, CXCL13, or CCL2) interacting with their receptors or by the exchange of material (protein, microRNAs or long non-coding RNAs) via extracellular vesicles. These different communication methods lead to different activation pathways (including BCR and NFkappaB pathways), gene expression modifications (chemokines, antiapoptotic protein increase, prognostic biomarkers), chemotaxis, homing in lymphoid tissues and survival of leukemic cells. In addition, these interactions are bidirectional, and CLL cells can manipulate the normal surrounding stromal cells in different ways to establish a supportive microenvironment. Here, we review this complex crosstalk between CLL cells and stromal cells, focusing on the different types of interactions, activated pathways, treatment strategies to disrupt this bidirectional communication, and the prognostic impact of these induced modifications.","['Dubois, Nathan', 'Crompot, Emerence', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'Bron, Dominique', 'Lagneaux, Laurence', 'Stamatopoulos, Basile']","['Dubois N', 'Crompot E', 'Meuleman N', 'Bron D', 'Lagneaux L', 'Stamatopoulos B']",,"['Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, ULB-Research Cancer Center (U-CRC), Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, ULB-Research Cancer Center (U-CRC), Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, ULB-Research Cancer Center (U-CRC), Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, ULB-Research Cancer Center (U-CRC), Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, ULB-Research Cancer Center (U-CRC), Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, ULB-Research Cancer Center (U-CRC), Jules Bordet Institute, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200819,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7466743,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'extracellular vesicles', 'mesenchymal stromal cells', 'microenvironment', 'prognostic factor']",2020/09/26 06:00,2020/09/26 06:01,['2020/09/25 06:03'],"['2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:03 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.01422 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Aug 19;10:1422. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01422. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Dubois, Crompot, Meuleman, Bron, Lagneaux and Stamatopoulos.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacogenetic screening are affirmed for better management of IM therapy. The goal of this study was to gain a greater mechanistic understanding of the factors controlling variability in IM level and its relation to the response. One hundred and two patients with CML at chronic phase were recruited in this study. Blood samples were withdrawn at least 30 days after drug administration, and trough and peak concentrations of imatinib, N-des-methyl imatinib, and pyridine-N-oxide imatinib were determined by HPLC/MS/MS. Genetic polymorphism of the genes ABCG2 SNPs 34 G>A and 421C >A; ABCB1 SNPs 2677 G>A/T, 1236 C>T, 3435 C>T; SLCO1B3 SNPs 334 T>G and CYP3A5 were studied using PCR-RFLP technique. Our study presented significant higher trough IM (1,281 +/- 578 ng/ml), lower Peak/Trough ratio, clearance (Cl), and elimination rate constant, ke, among patients who achieved favorable responses (N = 64) than those for patients who suffered unfavorable response (N = 37). The P/T ratio was the only significant independent factor affecting response, as the P/T ratio increased by one, the risk of unfavorable response increased by more than double as compared to favorable response with 95% CI (1.28-3.92, P = 00.005). Moreover, like the results of IM, the trough concentration of Pyridine-N-oxide imatinib was significantly higher (P = 0.01) and its P/T ratio was significantly lower (P = 0.008) in patients achieved favorable response than those without. The wild GG genotype of the ABCG2.34 G>A gene was associated with favorable response (P = 0.01), lower Cl, Ke and high plasma IM trough level than both (AA+GA) genotypes. ABCG2.421C >A (CC) genotype had a significantly higher plasma peak of IM, N-des-methyl imatinib and higher Css. The GG and TG alleles of the SLCO1B3.334 T>G gene were significantly correlated to favorable response, while the wild allele TT was linked to unfavorable response (P = 0.03). In conclusion, the trough and P/ T ratio for both IM and Pyridine-N-oxide imatinib, in addition to Polymorphism of ABCG2 SNPs 34 G>A and SLCO1B3.334 T>G gene, is a good predictor for response of IM in CML Egyptian patients.","['Omran, Mervat M', 'Abdelfattah, Raafat', 'Moussa, Heba S', 'Alieldin, Nelly', 'Shouman, Samia A']","['Omran MM', 'Abdelfattah R', 'Moussa HS', 'Alieldin N', 'Shouman SA']",,"['Pharmacology Unit, Cancer Biology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Medical Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Medical Statistics Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pharmacology Unit, Cancer Biology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200819,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7466443,['NOTNLM'],"['ABCG2', 'CML', 'P/T ratio', 'SNP', 'imatinib', 'pyridine-N-oxide imatinib', 'response']",2020/09/26 06:00,2020/09/26 06:01,['2020/09/25 06:03'],"['2020/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:03 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.01348 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Aug 19;10:1348. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01348. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Omran, Abdelfattah, Moussa, Alieldin and Shouman.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: From May 2013 to May 2017, 83 adult patients newly diagnosed with AML in the Affiliated Hospital of BeiHua University and Jilin Chemical Hospital, were enrolled in this study. The expression of CXCR2 in bone marrow mononuclear cells was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Clinical information and RNA-sequencing datasets of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n = 136) were obtained. The associations between clinical parameters, prognosis, and CXCR2 expression were analyzed. Results: From both cohorts, patients with AML with M4 and M5 subtypes showed higher CXCR2 expression levels than those with other French-American-British (FAB) subtypes. Patients with extramedullary leukemia infiltration had higher CXCR2 levels than those without. In our cohort, patients with high CXCR2 levels (2.099) had lower relapse-free survival (RFS) (p < 0.000001) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.000107) than those with low levels (<2.099). High CXCR2 levels (2.082) also indicated a poor OS in the TCGA cohort but only in patients younger than 65 years (5-year OS: 7.7% versus 29.9% in those with CXCR2 levels < 2.082). High CXCR2 levels independently predicted poor prognosis in AML patients, as determined by Cox proportional hazards models. Conclusion: Our results suggest that high CXCR2 expression associates with the monocytic lineage of AML and is an independent risk factor for poor patient prognosis.","['Tang, Wei', 'Li, Zunyan', 'Li, Xian', 'Huo, Zhonghua']","['Tang W', 'Li Z', 'Li X', 'Huo Z']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6884-3843'],"['Department of Blood Transfusion, the Affiliated Hospital of BeiHua University, Jilin, Jilin Province, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, the Affiliated Hospital of BeiHua University, Jilin 132011, Jilin Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jilin Chemical Hospital, Jilin 132021, Jilin Province, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, the Affiliated Hospital of BeiHua University, Jilin, Jilin Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200914,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,PMC7493249,['NOTNLM'],"['CXCR2 expression', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'clinical features', 'correlations', 'prognosis']",2020/09/26 06:00,2020/09/26 06:01,['2020/09/25 06:02'],"['2020/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:02 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620720958586 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620720958586 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2020 Sep 14;11:2040620720958586. doi: 10.1177/2040620720958586. eCollection 2020.,"['(c) The Author(s), 2020.']",,"['Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that there is no conflict of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression levels of lncRNA AWPPH and ROCK2 were positively correlated with each other. lncRNA AWPPH and ROCK2 overexpression promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of Loucy cells, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. Overexpression of lncRNA AWPPH resulted in upregulation of ROCK2 expression in Loucy cells. Similarly, ROCK2 overexpression also resulted in upregulation of lncRNA AWPPH in Loucy cells, suggesting an element of reciprocity in the function of lncRNA AWPPH and ROCK2.

If MiHA are targeted that are exclusively expressed on hematopoietic cells of recipient origin, selective GVL reactivity without severe graft-vs.-host-disease (GVHD) may occur. In this phase I study we explored HA-1H TCR gene transfer into T cells harvested from the HA-1H negative stem-cell donor to treat HA-1H positive HLA-A(*)02:01 positive patients with high-risk leukemia after alloSCT. HA-1H is a hematopoiesis-restricted MiHA presented in HLA-A(*)02:01. Since we previously demonstrated that donor-derived virus-specific T-cell infusions did not result in GVHD, we used donor-derived EBV and/or CMV-specific T-cells to be redirected by HA-1H TCR. EBV and/or CMV-specific T-cells were purified, retrovirally transduced with HA-1H TCR, and expanded. Validation experiments illustrated dual recognition of viral antigens and HA-1H by HA-1H TCR-engineered virus-specific T-cells. Release criteria included products containing more than 60% antigen-specific T-cells. Patients with high risk leukemia following T-cell depleted alloSCT in complete or partial remission were eligible. HA-1H TCR T-cells were infused 8 and 14 weeks after alloSCT without additional pre-conditioning chemotherapy. For 4/9 included patients no appropriate products could be made. Their donors were all CMV-negative, thereby restricting the production process to EBV-specific T-cells. For 5 patients a total of 10 products could be made meeting the release criteria containing 3-280 x 10(6) virus and/or HA-1H TCR T-cells. No infusion-related toxicity, delayed toxicity or GVHD occurred. One patient with relapsed AML at time of infusions died due to rapidly progressing disease. Four patients were in remission at time of infusion. Two patients died of infections during follow-up, not likely related to the infusion. Two patients are alive and well without GVHD. In 2 patients persistence of HA-1H TCR T-cells could be illustrated correlating with viral reactivation, but no overt in-vivo expansion of infused T-cells was observed. In conclusion, HA-1H TCR-redirected virus-specific T-cells could be made and safely infused in 5 patients with high-risk AML, but overall feasibility and efficacy was too low to warrant further clinical development using this strategy. New strategies will be explored using patient-derived donor T-cells isolated after transplantation transduced with HA-1H-specific TCR to be infused following immune conditioning.","['van Balen, Peter', 'Jedema, Inge', 'van Loenen, Marleen M', 'de Boer, Renate', 'van Egmond, H M', 'Hagedoorn, Renate S', 'Hoogstaten, Conny', 'Veld, Sabrina A J', 'Hageman, Lois', 'van Liempt, P A G', 'Zwaginga, Jaap-Jan', 'Meij, Pauline', 'Veelken, H', 'Falkenburg, J H F', 'Heemskerk, Mirjam H M']","['van Balen P', 'Jedema I', 'van Loenen MM', 'de Boer R', 'van Egmond HM', 'Hagedoorn RS', 'Hoogstaten C', 'Veld SAJ', 'Hageman L', 'van Liempt PAG', 'Zwaginga JJ', 'Meij P', 'Veelken H', 'Falkenburg JHF', 'Heemskerk MHM']",,"['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Center for Clinical Transfusion Research, Sanquin Research, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Toxicology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200820,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (HA-1 antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects/mortality', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Netherlands', 'Oligopeptides/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*transplantation/virology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC7468382,['NOTNLM'],"['*HA-1', '*TCR gene transfer', '*allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*graft-vs.-tumor effect', '*minor histocompatibility antigen']",2020/09/26 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2020/09/25 06:01'],"['2019/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:01 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.01804 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Aug 20;11:1804. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.01804. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 van Balen, Jedema, van Loenen, de Boer, van Egmond, Hagedoorn,', 'Hoogstaten, Veld, Hageman, van Liempt, Zwaginga, Meij, Veelken, Falkenburg and', 'Heemskerk.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decitabine (DAC), a DNA demethylating agent, has been demonstrated to reverse exhaustion-associated DNA-methylation programs and to improve T cell responses against tumors. Here we show that DAC significantly enhances antileukemia functions of CD123 CAR-T cells in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, it inhibits the expression of DMNT3a and DNMT1. Using the Illumina Methylation EPIC BeadChip (850 K), we identified differentially methylated regions, most of which undergo hypomethylated changes. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that CD123 CAR-T cells treated with DAC were enriched in genes associated with naive, early memory T cells, as well as non-exhausted T cells. DAC treatment also results in upregulation of immune synapse-related genes. Finally, our data further suggest that DAC works through the regulation of cellular differentiation characterized by naive and memory phenotypes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that DAC improves the anti-leukemia properties of CD123-directed CAR-T cells, and provides a basis for rational combinatorial CAR-T-based immunotherapy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).","['You, Liangshun', 'Han, Qingmei', 'Zhu, Li', 'Zhu, Yijing', 'Bao, Changqian', 'Yang, Chunmei', 'Lei, Wen', 'Qian, Wenbin']","['You L', 'Han Q', 'Zhu L', 'Zhu Y', 'Bao C', 'Yang C', 'Lei W', 'Qian W']",,"['Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200818,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cellular Reprogramming/drug effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy/*methods', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine/*pharmacology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC7461863,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR-T immunotherapy', '*DNA-methylation', '*T cell subsets', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*decitabine', '*immune synapse']",2020/09/26 06:00,2021/04/13 06:00,['2020/09/25 06:01'],"['2020/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:01 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.01787 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Aug 18;11:1787. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.01787. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 You, Han, Zhu, Zhu, Bao, Yang, Lei and Qian.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several scientific studies have shown that 6-MITC possesses interesting antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet and antioxidant properties which therefore suggested us it could have an interesting chemopreventive potential. In a recent publication, we demonstrated, in two different leukemia cell lines, its ability to modulate several mechanisms supporting its antitumor activity. For this reason, we thought useful to continue the research, by investigating the potential antimutagenic activity of 6-MITC and thus better define its profile as a possible chemopreventive agent. 6-MITC antimutagenic effect against two known mutagenic agents: the clastogen Mitomycin C (MMC) and the aneuplodogen Vinblastine (VINB), was analyzed, in terms of micronuclei frequency decrease, after short- and long- time treatment on TK6 human cells, using a new automated protocol of the ""In Vitro Mammalian Cell Micronucleous Test"" by flow cytometry. The results showed a different behavior of the isothiocyante. In particular, 6-MITC was unable to counteract the MMC genotoxicity, but when it was associated with VINB a statistically significant decrease in the micronuclei frequency was registered. Overall, the results obtained suggest a potential antimutagenic activity of 6-MITC, in particular against the aneuploidogen agents. This ability, to inhibit or counteract the mutations at the cellular level has a great therapeutic value and it represents a mechanism through a chemopreventive agent can express its activity.","['Cocchi, Veronica', 'Hrelia, Patrizia', 'Lenzi, Monia']","['Cocchi V', 'Hrelia P', 'Lenzi M']",,"['Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200818,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC7461824,['NOTNLM'],"['6-MITC', 'TK6', 'antimutagenesis', 'chemoprevention', 'flow cytometry', 'micronuclei']",2020/09/26 06:00,2020/09/26 06:01,['2020/09/25 06:01'],"['2019/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:01 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2020.01242 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Aug 18;11:1242. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2020.01242. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Cocchi, Hrelia and Lenzi.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1-associated mRNA, including HBZ and tax, is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of ATLL. Using 88 ATLL tissue samples, we performed in situ mRNA analysis of HBZ and tax, and investigated its association with clinicopathological characteristics of ATLL. The median value of HBZ signals (/1000 ATLL cells) was 795.2 (range: 0.4-4013.1) and of tax signals (/1000 ATLL cells) was 5.1 (range: 0.1-891.2). The low-expression HBZ group displayed significant increase in the number of skin lesion (P = 0.0283). The high-expression tax group displayed significant increase in the number of PD-1-positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (P < 0.0001). In addition, we identified patients with very high-expression of tax signals (400 or more signals/1000 ATLL cells). These patients displayed significant reductions in the expression of HLA class I (P = 0.0385) and beta2M (P = 0.0124). Moreover, these patients displayed significantly poor overall survival (median survival time [MST] 7.7 months, 95% confidence interval [CI] [4.7-NA]), compared with the survival in patients with less than 400 tax signals (MST 22.6 months, 95% CI [13.7-41.7]) (P = 0.0499). These results suggest that Tax-mediated treatment of ATLL should be performed carefully in the high-expression tax group.

Population studies since the 1950s have consistently observed an increased incidence of hematologic SPMs, specifically acute leukemia, among MM survivors. Prolonged treatment with alkylators, especially melphalan, was associated with an increased hematologic SPM risk; likewise, autologous stem cell transplantation appeared to minimally increase SPM risk. Immunomodulatory drugs, specifically lenalidomide, was associated with an increased SPM incidence, although most studies concluded that the benefits of therapy outweighed any risks of SPM. Newer anti-myeloma therapy such as proteasome inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies did not appear to increase SPM risk although robust long-term follow-up is lacking. This review discusses current understanding regarding SPMs among survivors of MM, how different host-, disease- and treatment-related factors contribute to SPM incidence and highlights emerging screening guidelines and prognosis for SPMs.","['Poh, Christina', 'Keegan, Theresa', 'Rosenberg, Aaron Seth']","['Poh C', 'Keegan T', 'Rosenberg AS']",,"['University of California, Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, Sacramento, CA, USA; University of Washington, Department of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Seattle, WA, USA.

We analyzed multiple samples from seven differently treated children with RE and evaluated the effects of immunotherapies on neuroinflammation. Immunotherapy was introduced to all patients at the time of intractable epilepsy and they all had to undergo hemispherothomy. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, Luminex multiplex bead and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques were combined to determine: 1) inflammatory changes and lymphocyte subpopulations in 45 brain tissues; 2) lymphocyte subpopulations and the levels of 12 chemokines/cytokines in 24 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and 30 blood samples; and 3) the dynamics of these parameters in four RE patients from whom multiple samples were collected. RESULTS: Sustained T cell-targeted therapy with cyclophosphamide, natalizumab, alemtuzumab, and intrathecal methotrexate (ITMTX), but not with azathioprine, substantially reduced inflammation in brain tissues. Despite the therapy, the distributions of CD8(+) T cells and the levels of C-X-C motif ligand (CXCL) 10, CXCL13, and B cell activating factor (BAFF) in patients' CSF remained increased compared to controls. A therapeutic approach combining alemtuzumab and ITMTX was the most effective in producing simultaneous reductions in histopathological inflammatory findings and in the numbers of activated CD8(+) T cells in the brain tissue, as well as in the overall CD8(+) T cell population and chemokine/cytokine production in the CSF. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that various T cell-targeted immunotherapies reduced inflammation in the brains of RE patients. The observation that intractable epilepsy persisted in all of the patients suggests a relative independence of seizure activity on the presence of T cells in the brain later in the disease course. Thus, new therapeutic targets must be identified. CXCL10, CXCL13 and BAFF levels were substantially increased in CSF from all patients and their significance in RE pathology remains to be addressed.","['Liba, Zuzana', 'Vaskova, Martina', 'Zamecnik, Josef', 'Kayserova, Jana', 'Nohejlova, Hana', 'Ebel, Matyas', 'Sanda, Jan', 'Ramos-Rivera, Gonzalo Alonso', 'Brozova, Klara', 'Liby, Petr', 'Tichy, Michal', 'Krsek, Pavel']","['Liba Z', 'Vaskova M', 'Zamecnik J', 'Kayserova J', 'Nohejlova H', 'Ebel M', 'Sanda J', 'Ramos-Rivera GA', 'Brozova K', 'Liby P', 'Tichy M', 'Krsek P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0483-8110'],"['Department of Pediatric Neurology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, V Uvalu 84, 15006, Prague, Czech Republic. zuzana.liba@fnmotol.cz.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Department of Pediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Immunology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Imunale s.r.o, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Neurology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, V Uvalu 84, 15006, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Neurology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Neurology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, V Uvalu 84, 15006, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Radiology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', ""Department of Pediatric Neurology, Comenius University Faculty of Medicine and National Institute of Children's Diseases, Bratislava, Slovak Republic."", 'Department of Pediatric Neurology, Thomayer Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Neurology and Clinical Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Neurology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, V Uvalu 84, 15006, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200924,England,BMC Neurol,BMC neurology,100968555,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Brain/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Encephalitis/pathology/*therapy', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Inflammation/therapy', 'Male']",PMC7517818,['NOTNLM'],"['Alemtuzumab', 'Chemokines', 'Cytokines', 'Immunotherapy effect', 'Intrathecal methotrexate', 'Lymphocyte subpopulations', 'Rasmussen encephalitis']",2020/09/26 06:00,2020/12/16 06:00,['2020/09/25 05:32'],"['2020/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 05:32 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12883-020-01932-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12883-020-01932-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Neurol. 2020 Sep 24;20(1):359. doi: 10.1186/s12883-020-01932-9.,,"['00064203-6005/Ministerstvo Zdravotnictvi Ceske Republiky', '914218/Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky', '-/Neuron Foundation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported that ORC4 also plays a vital role in polar body extrusion (PBE) during oogenesis in which half the chromosomes are extruded from the oocyte. We hypothesized that ORC4 might play a broader role in chromatin elimination. We tested its role in enucleation during the development of erythrocytes. Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells can be propagated in culture indefinitely and can be induced to enucleate their DNA by treatment with Vacuolin-1, thereby mimicking normal erythrocyte enucleation. We found that ORC4 appeared around the nuclei of the MEL cells with Vacuolin-1 treatment, gradually increasing in thickness before enucleation. We then tested whether ORC4 was required for MEL enucleation by down regulating ORC4 with siRNA-ORC4 during Vacuolin-1 treatment and found that this prevented MEL enucleation. These data are consistent with the model that ORC4 is required for erythroblast enucleation just as it is for oocyte PBE. They suggest a new model in which ORC4 expression is a marker for the initiation to the enucleation pathway.","['Nguyen, Hieu', 'Ung, Anna', 'Ward, W Steven']","['Nguyen H', 'Ung A', 'Ward WS']",,"['Department of Anatomy, Biochemistry, and Physiology, John A.

Interpheron &#945; and bone marrow transplantation used to be the main treatment modalities for patients with CML 20 years ago. Due to the introduction of imatinib mesylate since the year 2000 the outcome of CML patients has dramatically improved. The survival of both younger and elderly patients in the case of an optimal response has been prolonged and currently is close to survival of healthy population. Although, one third of patients does not respond well to first line imatinib and needs to change the treatment to second line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI: bosutinib, dasatinib and nilotinib). Younger patients without cardiologic and metabolic disorders and those with poor risk profile score may have benefit from TKI of 2nd generation as a 1st line treatment option with the aim of reaching deeper molecular response and the chance of treatment free remission (TFR) in future. By older patients with severe comorbidities and in patients with good risk profile score imatinib as a 1st line treatment option can be used. For patients who are resistant simultaneously to 2nd generation TKI and for patients with mutation T315I ponatinib - TKI of 3rd generation can be used effectively. Intolerance and toxicity of TKI s are the main barriers of effective CML treatment. TKI selection for each patient should be individual. Patient s cooperation with medical team is crucial and inevitable in long time treatment process. The chance for TFR has become feasible for approximately 40-60 % CML patients in deep and durable molecular remission and represents a further important milestone in the management of CML patients.","['Slezakova, Katarina', 'Mistrik, Martin', 'Batorova, Angelika']","['Slezakova K', 'Mistrik M', 'Batorova A']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['bosutinib', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'dasatinib', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'imatinib', 'nilotinib', 'ponatinib', 'remission', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2020/09/26 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/09/25 05:30'],"['2020/09/25 05:30 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['123885 [pii]'],ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 2020 Summer;66(4):214-224.,,,,,,,,,Su&#269;asne mo&#382;nosti lie&#269;by BCR-ABL1 pozitivnej chronickej myelocytovej leukemie u dospelych pacientov.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To highlight the potential role of caffeine in managing different neurodegenerative diseases, we identified studies by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar by scrutinizing the lists of pertinent publications. According to the collected overall findings, caffeine may reduce the elevated oxidative stress; inhibit the activation of adenosine A2A, thereby regulating the accumulation of Abeta; reduce the hyperphosphorylation of tau; and reduce the accumulation of misfolded proteins, such as alpha-synuclein, in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The studies have suggested that caffeine has promising protective effects against different neurodegenerative diseases and that these effects may be used to tackle the neurological diseases and/or their consequences. Here, we review the ongoing research on the role of caffeine in the management of different neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on AD and PD. The current findings suggest that caffeine produces potent antioxidant, inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects against different models of neurodegenerative disease, including AD, PD, and other neurodegenerative disorders. Caffeine has shown strong antagonistic effects against the adenosine A2A receptor, which is a microglial receptor, and strong agonistic effects against nuclear-related factor-2 (Nrf-2), thereby regulating the cellular homeostasis at the brain by reducing oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, regulating the accumulation of alpha-synuclein in PD and tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloidogenesis, and synaptic deficits in AD, which are the cardinal features of these neurodegenerative diseases.","['Ikram, Muhammad', 'Park, Tae Ju', 'Ali, Tahir', 'Kim, Myeong Ok']","['Ikram M', 'Park TJ', 'Ali T', 'Kim MO']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5226-4081'],"['Division of Life Science and Applied Life Science (BK21 plus), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow 0747 657 5394, UK."", 'Division of Life Science and Applied Life Science (BK21 plus), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.', 'Division of Life Science and Applied Life Science (BK21 plus), College of Natural Sciences, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200922,Switzerland,Antioxidants (Basel),"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",101668981,,,,PMC7554764,['NOTNLM'],"[""Alzheimer's disease"", ""Parkinson's disease"", 'antioxidant effects', 'caffeine', 'neurodegeneration', 'neuroprotective effects']",2020/09/26 06:00,2020/09/26 06:01,['2020/09/25 01:01'],"['2020/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/26 06:01 [medline]']","['antiox9090902 [pii]', '10.3390/antiox9090902 [doi]']",epublish,Antioxidants (Basel). 2020 Sep 22;9(9). pii: antiox9090902. doi: 10.3390/antiox9090902.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of the patients with brain tumors have a median survival rate of 12%. Brain tumors are lethal despite the availability of advanced treatment options such as surgical removal, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. In this study, we have evaluated the anti-cancer effects of pimozide, which is a neuroleptic drug used for the treatment of schizophrenia and chronic psychosis. Pimozide significantly reduced the proliferation of U-87MG, Daoy, GBM 28, and U-251MG brain cancer cell lines by inducing apoptosis with IC50 (Inhibitory concentration 50) ranging from 12 to 16 muM after 48 h of treatment. Our Western blotting analysis indicated that pimozide suppressed the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 and Src at Tyr416, and it inhibited the expression of anti-apoptotic markers c-Myc, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2. Significant autophagy induction was observed with pimozide treatment. LC3B, Beclin-1, and ATG5 up-regulation along with autolysosome formation confirmed the induction of autophagy with pimozide treatment. Inhibiting autophagy using 3-methyladenine or LC3B siRNA significantly blocked the apoptosis-inducing effects of pimozide, suggesting that pimozide mediated its apoptotic effects by inducing autophagy. Oral administration of 25 mg/kg pimozide suppressed the intracranially implanted U-87MG tumor growth by 45% in athymic nude mice. The chronic administration of pimozide showed no general signs of toxicity, and the behavioral activity of the mice remained unchanged. Taken together, these results indicate that pimozide inhibits the growth of brain cancer by autophagy-mediated apoptosis.","['Ranjan, Alok', 'Kaushik, Itishree', 'Srivastava, Sanjay K']","['Ranjan A', 'Kaushik I', 'Srivastava SK']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8989-0438'],"['Department of Biomedical Science, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, TX 79106, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, TX 79106, USA.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics and Biotechnology, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Center for Tumor Immunology and Targeted Cancer Therapy, Abilene, TX 79601, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, TX 79106, USA.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics and Biotechnology, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Center for Tumor Immunology and Targeted Cancer Therapy, Abilene, TX 79601, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200922,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (ATG5 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antipsychotic Agents)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (MAP1LC3B protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '1HIZ4DL86F (Pimozide)', '5142-23-4 (3-methyladenine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antipsychotic Agents/pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/genetics', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5/genetics/metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Repositioning', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Pimozide/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC7563195,['NOTNLM'],"['*STAT3', '*autophagy', '*brain tumor', '*drug repurposing', '*glioblastoma', '*medulloblastoma']",2020/09/26 06:00,2021/03/25 06:00,['2020/09/25 01:01'],"['2020/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9092141 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9092141 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Sep 22;9(9). pii: cells9092141. doi: 10.3390/cells9092141.,,['R01 CA129038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most deleterious types of damage are double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are repaired by homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Single strand breaks (SSBs) can be corrected through base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and mismatch repair (MMR). Failure to restore DNA lesions or inappropriately repaired DNA damage culminates in genomic instability and changes in the regulation of cellular functions. Intriguingly, particular mutations and translocations are accompanied by special types of leukemia. Besides, expression patterns of certain repair genes are altered in different hematologic malignancies. Moreover, analysis of mutations in key mediators of DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways, as well as investigation of their expression and function, may provide us with emerging biomarkers of response/resistance to treatment. Therefore, defective DDR pathways can offer a rational starting point for developing DNA repair-targeted drugs. In this review, we address genetic alterations and gene/protein expression changes, as well as provide an overview of DNA repair pathways.","['Rahimian, Elahe', 'Amini, Ali', 'Alikarami, Fatemeh', 'Pezeshki, Seyed Mohammad Sadegh', 'Saki, Najmaldin', 'Safa, Majid']","['Rahimian E', 'Amini A', 'Alikarami F', 'Pezeshki SMS', 'Saki N', 'Safa M']",,"['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."", 'Thalassemia & Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Health Research Institute, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Thalassemia & Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Health Research Institute, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

This work aims to study the influence of Mb3a2 and Mb2a2 transcripts on clinico-biological parameters and the molecular response in patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) treated with Imatinib as frontline therapy. METHODS: This is six years prospective study started in March 1 st, 2013. 67 patients with newly CP-CML were treated by Imatinib as frontline therapy. Clinical and biological characteristics disease were collected for all patients. Molecular typing was performed by multiplex RT-PCR and quantification of transcripts by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). The cumulative incidence of deep molecular response (DMR) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The comparison was made using the parametric Log-Rank test. A value of P </= 0.05 is considered significant. RESULTS: 61% of patients expressed b3a2, 35.82% b2a2 and 2.98% expressed a rare transcript of type e19a2. At diagnosis, the b2a2 type had a higher level of expression than that of b3a2 (67.92 vs 53.79%; P = 0.03). This insignificant difference between the two transcript subgroups was also observed for rates below 1% at 6 months (54 vs 39; P = 0.26) and below 0.1% (54 vs 44 %; P = 0.50), (77 vs 50%; P = 0.09) and (81 vs 78 %; P = 0.52) at 12, 18 and 24 months respectively. The two types of transcript had almost the same kinetics. Nevertheless, the absolute value of the BCR-ABL1/ABL ratio decrease was faster in the group of patients expressing b3a2, than in those expressing b2a2. At 18 months post IM therapy, patients with a b3a2 transcript have a trend of better MMR that those with b2a2 (77 vs 50%; P = 0.09). The DMR was not significantly different between two groups at 24 months (50 vs 32%; P = 0.20) and 36 months (75 vs 70%; P = 0.54) respectively. The cumulative probability of achieving MRD at 5 years was higher in patients with b3a2 type but not statistically significant; (85 vs. 68%; P = 0.17). CONCLUSION: Patients with b3a2 transcript may be associated with a better response to Imatinib therapy.","['Nachi, Mourad', 'Kihel, Ibtissem', 'Entasoltane, Badra', 'Brahimi, Mohamed', 'Yafour, Nabil', 'Guella, Djaoued', 'Abed, Amine', 'Bekadja, Mohamed A']","['Nachi M', 'Kihel I', 'Entasoltane B', 'Brahimi M', 'Yafour N', 'Guella D', 'Abed A', 'Bekadja MA']",,"['Faculty of Medicine, Ahmed Ben Bella University of Oran, Algeria; Department of Molecular Biology, University Hospital Center, Oran, Algeria.

A total of 390 genetic alterations were identified in 149 patients with a frequency of 87.1%. Younger age and high sensitivity to induction chemotherapy were associated with a lower number of mutations. NPM1 mutation was closely related to DNMT3A and FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations, but mutually exclusive with ASXL1 mutation and CEBPA(double mutation) . In univariate analysis, ASXL1 or TET2 mutation predicted shorter overall survival (OS) or relapse-free survival (RFS), DNMT3A, FLT3-ITD, or RUNX1 mutation predicted a higher likelihood of remission-induction failure, whereas NRAS mutation or CEBPA(double mutation) predicted longer OS. Concurrent DNMT3A, FLT3-ITD, and NPM1 mutations predicted shorter OS. Hypomethylation agents could improve the OS in patients with DNA methylation-related mutations. According to multivariate analysis, TET2 mutation was recognized as an independent prognostic factors for RFS. In summary, our study provided a detailed pattern of gene mutations and their prognostic relevance in Chinese AML patients based on targeted next-generation sequencing screening.","['Wang, Rui-Qi', 'Chen, Chong-Jian', 'Jing, Yu', 'Qin, Jia-Yue', 'Li, Yan', 'Chen, Guo-Feng', 'Zhou, Wei', 'Li, Yong-Hui', 'Wang, Juan', 'Li, Da-Wei', 'Zhao, Hong-Mei', 'Wang, Bian-Hong', 'Wang, Li-Li', 'Wang, Hong', 'Wang, Meng-Zhen', 'Gao, Xiao-Ning', 'Yu, Li']","['Wang RQ', 'Chen CJ', 'Jing Y', 'Qin JY', 'Li Y', 'Chen GF', 'Zhou W', 'Li YH', 'Wang J', 'Li DW', 'Zhao HM', 'Wang BH', 'Wang LL', 'Wang H', 'Wang MZ', 'Gao XN', 'Yu L']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4721-0016', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8352-092X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2035-7472']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Medicine School, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Annoroad Gene Technology Co, Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Annoroad Gene Technology Co, Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Annoroad Gene Technology Co, Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, Beijing, China.', 'Annoroad Gene Technology Co, Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, Beijing, China.', 'Annoroad Gene Technology Co, Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area, Beijing, China.', 'Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, Changping District, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Carson International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200924,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Beijing', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC7666719,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*genetic mutations', '*next-generation sequencing', '*prognosis stratification']",2020/09/25 06:00,2021/07/20 06:00,['2020/09/24 17:16'],"['2018/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/24 17:16 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3467 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2020 Nov;9(22):8457-8467. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3467.

Autophagy is regulated by more than 30 genes and it is one of several mechanisms by which cells maintain homeostasis. Autophagy promotes cancer progression and drug resistance. Several genes play important roles in autophagy-induced tumorigenesis and drug resistance including Beclin-1, MIF, HMGB1, p53, PTEN, p62, RAC3, SRC3, NF-2, MEG3, LAPTM4B, mTOR, BRAF and c-MYC. These genes alter cell growth, cellular microenvironment and cell division. Mechanisms involved in tumorigenesis and drug resistance include microdeletions, genetic mutations, loss of heterozygosity, hypermethylation, microsatellite instability and translational modifications at a molecular level. Disrupted or altered autophagy has been reported in hematological malignancies like lymphoma, leukemia and myeloma as well as multiple solid organ tumors like colorectal, hepatocellular, gall bladder, pancreatic, gastric and cholangiocarcinoma among many other malignancies. In addition, defects in autophagy also play a role in drug resistance in cancers like osteosarcoma, ovarian and lung carcinomas following treatment with drugs such as doxorubicin, paclitaxel, cisplatin, gemcitabine and etoposide. Therapeutic approaches that modulate autophagy are a novel future direction for cancer drug development that may help to prevent issues with disease progression and overcome drug resistance.","['Usman, Rana Muhammad', 'Razzaq, Faryal', 'Akbar, Arshia', 'Farooqui, Arafat Ali', 'Iftikhar, Ahmad', 'Latif, Azka', 'Hassan, Hamza', 'Zhao, Jianjun', 'Carew, Jennifer S', 'Nawrocki, Steffan T', 'Anwer, Faiz']","['Usman RM', 'Razzaq F', 'Akbar A', 'Farooqui AA', 'Iftikhar A', 'Latif A', 'Hassan H', 'Zhao J', 'Carew JS', 'Nawrocki ST', 'Anwer F']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2358-7057'],"['Department of Medicine, The University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Foundation University Medical College, Islamabad, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medical Intensive Care, Holy Family Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medicine, King Edward Medical University, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Crieghton University, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Boston University Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200924,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Autophagy', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Autophagy-related genes', 'autophagy', 'drug resistance', 'hydroxychloroquine', 'tumorigenesis']",2020/09/25 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2020/09/24 17:16'],"['2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/24 17:16 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajco.13449 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2021 Jun;17(3):193-208. doi: 10.1111/ajco.13449.

METHODS: We constructed second-generation CAR T cells expressing CD19 scFV-CD28-CD3zeta with different lengths of the spacer region: full, intermediate, and short length, by using a lentiviral vector. We wanted to determine whether the difference in length of the spacer would affect the cytotoxic potential of the CD19 CAR T cells against the leukemic cells. RESULTS: We found that all constructs of CD19 CAR T cells exhibited a similar level of cytotoxicity against several human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. For the clinical application, we chose the intermediate length spacer construct CD19 CAR T cells, hypothesizing that the highest transduction efficiency coupled with a slower initial proliferation in vitro might lead to effective leukemic cell kill, yet a lower probability for serious clinical side effects. We then tested the clinical efficacy of our CD19 CAR T cells in one patient with refractory/relapsed acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. This patient indeed had minimal clinical side effects after the CAR T-cell infusion, and he remains in an unmaintained, ongoing complete remission 10+ months after his T-cell treatment. CONCLUSION: Our CD19 CAR T cells demonstrated efficacies in acute lymphoblastic B-cell leukemia, and will be used to establish an immunotherapeutic program for high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Thailand. We propose that this approach can be used as a model for how this new exciting technology can be applied directly at individual institutions that treat (a large number of) patients with high-risk leukemia.","['Prasongtanakij, Somsak', 'Anurathapan, Usanarat', 'Vanichapol, Thitinee', 'Jittorntrum, Bunyada', 'Atjanasuppat, Korakot', 'Pongpitcha, Pongpak', 'Pakakasama, Samart', 'Songdej, Duantida', 'Sirachainan, Nongnuch', 'Paisooksantivatana, Karan', 'Borwaornpinyo, Suparerk', 'Andersson, Borje S', 'Hongeng, Suradej']","['Prasongtanakij S', 'Anurathapan U', 'Vanichapol T', 'Jittorntrum B', 'Atjanasuppat K', 'Pongpitcha P', 'Pakakasama S', 'Songdej D', 'Sirachainan N', 'Paisooksantivatana K', 'Borwaornpinyo S', 'Andersson BS', 'Hongeng S']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5218-0494'],"['Office of Research, Academic Affairs and Innovation, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Office of Research, Academic Affairs and Innovation, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200924,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD19', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells', 'cytotoxicity', 'immunotherapy']",2020/09/25 06:00,2020/09/25 06:00,['2020/09/24 17:16'],"['2020/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/24 17:16 [entrez]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ajco.13474 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2020 Sep 24. doi: 10.1111/ajco.13474.,"['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']","['FDA-CO-2559-3325-TH/National Science and Technology Development Agency', 'TC3/62/Thailand Center of Excellence for Life Sciences']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RTs should possess elevated temperature optimum, high thermal stability, processivity and tolerance to contaminants. Here, we constructed a set of chimeric RTs, based on the combination of the Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MuLV) RT and either of two DNA-binding domains: the DNA-binding domain of the DNA ligase from Pyrococcus abyssi or the DNA-binding Sto7d protein from Sulfolobus tokodaii. The processivity and efficiency of cDNA synthesis of the chimeric RT with Sto7d at the C-end are increased several fold. The attachment of Sto7d enhances the tolerance of M-MuLV RT to the most common amplification inhibitors: NaCl, urea, guanidinium chloride, formamide, components of human whole blood and human blood plasma. Thus, fusing M-MuLV RT with an additional domain results in more robust and efficient RTs.","['Oscorbin, Igor P', 'Wong, Pei Fong', 'Boyarskikh, Ulyana A', 'Khrapov, Evgeny A', 'Filipenko, Maksim L']","['Oscorbin IP', 'Wong PF', 'Boyarskikh UA', 'Khrapov EA', 'Filipenko ML']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3754-5824'],"['Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201005,England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ions)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['DNA, Complementary/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Viral', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Ions', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Protein Domains', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Sulfolobus', 'Temperature']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*M-MuLV reverse transcriptase', '*cDNA synthesis', '*chimeric protein', '*protein engineering', '*reverse transcription']",2020/09/25 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/09/24 17:15'],"['2020/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/24 17:15 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1873-3468.13934 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2020 Dec;594(24):4338-4356. doi: 10.1002/1873-3468.13934.

In medical decisions, to reach effective, quick, and reliable results, there is a need for a simple decision-making model based on a specialist's self-assessment. It may help the medical team before final diagnosis by costly and time-consuming procedures such as bone marrow sampling and pathological test as well as provide an appropriate prognosis and diagnosis tool. Because of the complex and not the well-defined structure of medical data, the use of intelligent methods must be considered. For this purpose, first, a data-driven Bayesian network (BN) and Greedy algorithm are employed to determine causal relationships and probability between nodes using the real set of data. Then, these causal relationships will form based on the fuzzy cognitive map (FCM). Finally, according to scenarios defined, the results are analyzed. These analyses are also repeated for each type of acute leukemia including acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelocytic leukemia (AML).

Indirect comparison with ibrutinib in a real-world setting. A GIMEMA-ERIC and US study.,8468-8479,10.1002/cam4.3470 [doi],"Limited information is available on the efficacy of front-line bendamustine and rituximab (BR) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with reduced renal function or coexisting conditions. We therefore analyzed a cohort of real-world patients and performed a matched adjusted indirect comparison with a cohort of patients treated with ibrutinib. One hundred and fifty-seven patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <70 mL/min and/or CIRS score >6 were treated with BR. The median age was 72 years; 69% of patients had >/=2 comorbidities and the median CrCl was 59.8 mL/min. 17.6% of patients carried TP53 disruption. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 45 months; TP53 disruption was associated with a shorter PFS (P = 0.05). The overall survival (OS) at 12, 24, and 36 months was 96.2%, 90.1%, and 79.5%, respectively. TP53 disruption was associated with an increased risk of death (P = 0.01). Data on 162 patients >/=65 years treated with ibrutinib were analyzed and compared with 165 patients >/=65 years treated with BR. Factors predicting for a longer PFS at multivariable analysis in the total patient population treated with BR and ibrutinib were age (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10, P < 0.01) and treatment with ibrutinib (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33-0.93, P = 0.03). In a post hoc analysis of patients in advanced stage, a significant PFS advantage was observed in patient who had received ibrutinib (P = 0.03), who showed a trend for OS advantage (P = 0.08). We arrived at the following conclusions: (a) BR is a relatively effective first-line regimen in a real-world population of unfit patients without TP53 disruption, (b) ibrutinib provided longer disease control than BR in patients with advanced disease stage.","['Cuneo, Antonio', 'Mato, Anthony R', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Allan, John N', 'Pagel, John M', 'Brander, Danielle M', 'Hill, Brian T', 'Winter, Allison', 'Lamanna, Nicole', 'Tam, Constantine S', 'Jacobs, Ryan', 'Lansigan, Frederick', 'Barr, Paul M', 'Shadman, Mazyar', 'Skarbnik, Alan P', 'Pu, Jeffrey J', 'Sehgal, Alison R', 'Schuster, Stephen J', 'Shah, Nirav N', 'Ujjani, Chaitra S', 'Roeker, Lindsey', 'Orlandi, Ester Maria', 'Billio, Atto', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Spacek, Martin', 'Marchetti, Monia', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Ilariucci, Fiorella', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Farina, Lucia', 'Molica, Stefano', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Coscia, Marta', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'de la Serna, Javier', 'Medina Perez, Angeles', 'Ferrarini, Isacco', 'Cimino, Giuseppe', 'Cavallari, Maurizio', 'Cucci, Rosalba', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Foa, Robin', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Cuneo A', 'Mato AR', 'Rigolin GM', 'Piciocchi A', 'Gentile M', 'Laurenti L', 'Allan JN', 'Pagel JM', 'Brander DM', 'Hill BT', 'Winter A', 'Lamanna N', 'Tam CS', 'Jacobs R', 'Lansigan F', 'Barr PM', 'Shadman M', 'Skarbnik AP', 'Pu JJ', 'Sehgal AR', 'Schuster SJ', 'Shah NN', 'Ujjani CS', 'Roeker L', 'Orlandi EM', 'Billio A', 'Trentin L', 'Spacek M', 'Marchetti M', 'Tedeschi A', 'Ilariucci F', 'Gaidano G', 'Doubek M', 'Farina L', 'Molica S', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Coscia M', 'Mauro FR', 'de la Serna J', 'Medina Perez A', 'Ferrarini I', 'Cimino G', 'Cavallari M', 'Cucci R', 'Vignetti M', 'Foa R', 'Ghia P']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8724-1875', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8370-5190', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8437-7539', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6027-3359', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7498-3159', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4336-1071', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7615-0572', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2795-6507', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2425-9474']","['Hematology, Department of Medical Sciences, St. Anna University Hospital, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematological Oncology, CLL Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Hematology, Department of Medical Sciences, St. Anna University Hospital, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases (GIMEMA), Data Center and Health Outcomes Research Unit, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Hematology Unit, A.O. of Cosenza, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Department of Radiological, Radiotherapeutic and Hematological Sciences, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""A.

Rather, the nucleoside diphosphate-linked X-component motif 15 (NUDT15) gene is frequently linked to mercaptopurine (MP) intolerance and myelotoxicity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in East Asians; however, little is known about the NUDT15 polymorphism in healthy children, especially in ethnic minorities in China. METHODS: A total of 162 cases of healthy children with Bai nationality were enrolled for NUDT15 genotyping. RESULTS: Three coding variants were identified in the NUDT15 gene including rs186364861, rs746071566 and rs116855232. Notably, the rs746071566 and rs116855232 in NUDT15 showed much higher frequencies in healthy children with Bai nationality compared with healthy East Asian populations, suggesting a concentrated distribution of these variants in the Bai ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS: This finding reveals the genetic polymorphism of NUDT15 in children with Chinese Bai nationality, providing a biological genetic background for the individualized therapy of thiopurines for children with Bai nationality in China.","['Pu, Gangling', 'Wang, Yali', 'Duan, Shaoqin', 'Chen, Jingpei', 'Yang, Chunhui', 'Cui, Tingting', 'Fang, Chunlian', 'Zhou, Yan', 'Zhang, Han', 'Tian, Xin']","['Pu G', 'Wang Y', 'Duan S', 'Chen J', 'Yang C', 'Cui T', 'Fang C', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhang H', 'Tian X']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2684-512X'],"[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kunming Children's Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan, China."", 'Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, China.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Rizhao People's Hospital, Rizhao, Shandong, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kunming Children's Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan, China."", 'Wuhan Women and Children Medical Care Centre, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kunming Children's Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kunming Children's Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan, China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kunming Children's Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan, China."", 'Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kunming Children's Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan, China."", 'Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, China.', 'Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Kunming, Yunnan, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kunming Children's Hospital, Kunming, Yunnan, China."", ""Yunnan Key Laboratory of Children's Major Disease Research, Kunming, Yunnan, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210608,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.6.1.- (NUDT15 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic', 'Child', 'China', '*Ethnicity/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', '*Pyrophosphatases/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['NUDT15', 'Bai nationality', 'gene polymorphism', 'mercaptopurine']",2020/09/25 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2020/09/24 08:50'],"['2020/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/24 08:50 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.14480 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2021 Jul;63(7):790-796. doi: 10.1111/ped.14480.

However, the development of dietary interventions for treating such damage has not been advanced. Here, we investigated the effect of dietary intervention with lauric acid (LAA) and glucose, which was effective against skeletal muscle sarcopenia in a mouse cachexia model, on myocardial damage. Treatment of H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts with lauric acid promoted mitochondrial respiration and increased ATP production by Seahorse flux analysis, but did not increase oxidative stress. Glycolysis was also promoted by LAA. In contrast, mitochondrial respiration and ATP production were suppressed, and oxidative stress was increased in an in vitro cachexia model in which cardiomyoblasts were treated with mouse cachexia ascites. Ascites-treated H9c2 cells with concurrent treatment with LAA and high glucose showed that mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis were promoted more than that of the control, and ATP was restored to the level of the control. Oxidative stress was also reduced by the combined treatment. In the mouse cachexia model, myocardiac atrophy and decreased levels of a marker of muscle maturity, SDS-soluble MYL1, were observed. When LAA in CE-2 diet was orally administered alone, no significant rescue was observed in the cancer-derived myocardial disorder. In contrast, combined oral administration of LAA and glucose recovered myocardial atrophy and MYL1 to levels observed in the control without increase in the cancer weight. Therefore, it is suggested that dietary intervention using a combination of LAA and glucose for cancer cachexia might improve cancer-derived myocardial damage.","['Nukaga, Shota', 'Mori, Takuya', 'Miyagawa, Yoshihiro', 'Fujiwara-Tani, Rina', 'Sasaki, Takamitsu', 'Fujii, Kiyomu', 'Mori, Shiori', 'Goto, Kei', 'Kishi, Shingo', 'Nakashima, Chie', 'Ohmori, Hitoshi', 'Kawahara, Isao', 'Luo, Yi', 'Kuniyasu, Hiroki']","['Nukaga S', 'Mori T', 'Miyagawa Y', 'Fujiwara-Tani R', 'Sasaki T', 'Fujii K', 'Mori S', 'Goto K', 'Kishi S', 'Nakashima C', 'Ohmori H', 'Kawahara I', 'Luo Y', 'Kuniyasu H']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2298-8825'],"['Department of Molecular Pathology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan.', 'Division of Rehabilitation, Hanna Central Hospital, Ikoma, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan.', 'Division of Rehabilitation, Hoshida Minami Hospital, Katano, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan.', 'Division of Rehabilitation, Hanna Central Hospital, Ikoma, Japan.', 'Key Laboratory of Neuroregeneration of Jiangsu and Ministry of Education, Co-Innovation Center of Neuroregeneration, Nantong University, Nantong, China.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201002,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Lauric Acids)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '1160N9NU9U (lauric acid)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Cachexia/complications/*diet therapy/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Energy Metabolism/drug effects', 'Glucose/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Lauric Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitochondria, Heart/drug effects/metabolism', 'Muscular Atrophy/*diet therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'Sarcopenia/diet therapy/etiology/pathology']",PMC7734008,['NOTNLM'],"['atrophy', 'cachexia', 'mitochondria', 'myocardium', 'oxidative stress']",2020/09/25 06:00,2020/12/30 06:00,['2020/09/24 08:50'],"['2020/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/24 08:50 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14656 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2020 Dec;111(12):4605-4615. doi: 10.1111/cas.14656.

However, a better understanding of the cancer treatment through cell apoptosis staging is still required. Evaluation of the timeline and responses of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells to the arsenic trioxide (ATO) treatment is essential for determining the oral dosage in leukemia prognosis. Here, an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) indentation approach has been used to evaluate the mechanical responses of cellular responses of APL cells to ATO treatment, alongside well-established cell viability assays, as a novel method to determine the impact of drugs. In addition, cell morphology was quantified to monitor cellular apoptosis. Viability, morphology and elasticity changes of NB4 cells (derived from Human APL patients) were correlated to different time courses of the ATO treatments. Unveiling the relationships among structural, morphological and nanomechanical properties in response to ATO drug treatment promises to pave the way for novel diagnostic tools for drug screening and for a better understanding of the specific physical and biological effects of drugs on diseased cells.","['Fortier, Helene', 'Gies, Valerie', 'Variola, Fabio', 'Wang, Chen', 'Zou, Shan']","['Fortier H', 'Gies V', 'Variola F', 'Wang C', 'Zou S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5519-6915', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2480-6821']","['Metrology Research Centre, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, K1A 0R6, Canada. shan.zou@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca and Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, K1N 6N5, Canada.', 'Metrology Research Centre, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, K1A 0R6, Canada. shan.zou@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, K1N 6N5, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, 600 University Avenue, Toronto, M5X 1G5, Canada.', 'Metrology Research Centre, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, K1A 0R6, Canada. shan.zou@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca and Department of Chemistry, Carleton University, 1125 Colonel By Drive, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anal Methods,Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,101519733,['S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)'],IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Elasticity', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force']",,,,2020/09/25 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/24 05:35'],"['2020/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/24 05:35 [entrez]']",['10.1039/d0ay01017k [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Methods. 2020 Oct 15;12(39):4734-4741. doi: 10.1039/d0ay01017k.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both univariable and multivariable analyses showed similar 5-year overall survival rates for MUD, MMUD, and Haplo patients: 71% (95% CI 56-86), 72% (95% CI 55-90), and 75% (95% CI 54-94), respectively (p = 0.97).

We previously identified HSD17B4 methylation as a marker for pCR by methylation screening. Here, we aimed to identify a new marker by conducting a multi-omics analysis of materials prepared by laser capture microdissection, and adding 71 new samples. In the screening set (n = 36), mutations, methylation, and expression were analyzed by targeted sequencing, Infinium 450 K, and expression microarray, respectively, and 15 genes were identified as differentially expressed and eight genomic regions as differentially methylated between cancer samples with and without pCR. In a validation set (n = 47), one gene showed differential expression, and one region had differential methylation. Further, in the re-validation set (n = 55), all new samples, only HSD17B4 methylation was significantly different. The HSD17B4 methylation was at the transcriptional start site of its major variant, and was associated with its silencing. HSD17B4 was highly expressed in the vast majority of human cancers, and its methylation was present only in breast cancers and one lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. A combination of estrogen receptor-negative status and HSD17B4 methylation showed a positive predictive value of 80.0%. During HER2-directed neoadjuvant therapy, HSD17B4 methylation was the most reliable marker to monitor response to the therapy. These results showed that HSD17B4 methylation is a candidate predictive and response marker of HER2-positive breast cancer to HER2-directed therapy.","['Yamashita, Satoshi', 'Hattori, Naoko', 'Fujii, Satoshi', 'Yamaguchi, Takeshi', 'Takahashi, Masato', 'Hozumi, Yasuo', 'Kogawa, Takahiro', 'El-Omar, Omar', 'Liu, Yu-Yu', 'Arai, Nobuaki', 'Mori, Akiko', 'Higashimoto, Hiroko', 'Ushijima, Toshikazu', 'Mukai, Hirofumi']","['Yamashita S', 'Hattori N', 'Fujii S', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Takahashi M', 'Hozumi Y', 'Kogawa T', 'El-Omar O', 'Liu YY', 'Arai N', 'Mori A', 'Higashimoto H', 'Ushijima T', 'Mukai H']",,"['Division of Epigenomics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Epigenomics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Pathology, Exploratory Oncology Research and Clinical Trial Center, National Cancer Center, 6-5-1, Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba, 277-8577, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Musashino Red Cross Hospital, 1-26-1, Kyonan, Musashino, Tokyo, 180-8610, Japan.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, Hokkaido Cancer Center, National Hospital Organization, Kikusui 4-2, Shiroishi-Ku, Sapporo, 003-0806, Japan.', 'Department of Breast and Endocrine Surgery, Ibaraki Clinical Education and Training Center, Faculty of Medicine, Tsukuba University, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, Ibaraki Prefectural Central Hospital, 6528 Koibuchi, Kasama, Ibaraki, 309-1793, Japan.', 'Department of Breast and Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, 6-5-1, Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba, 277-8577, Japan.', 'Division of Epigenomics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Epigenomics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan.', 'Division of Epigenomics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0045, Japan.', 'H.U.

METHODS: Among 110 297 radiologic technologists (83 655 women, 26 642 men) who completed a baseline questionnaire sometime during 1983-1998, a retrospective cohort study was undertaken to assess cumulative, low-to-moderate occupational radiation dose and haematopoietic malignancy mortality risks during 1983-2012. Cumulative bone marrow dose (mean 8.5 mGy, range 0-430 mGy) was estimated based on 921 134 badge monitoring measurements during 1960-1997, work histories and historical data; 35.4% of estimated doses were based on badge measurements. Poisson regression was used to estimate excess relative risk of haematopoietic cancers per 100 milligray (ERR/100 mGy) bone-marrow absorbed dose, adjusting for attained age, sex and birth year. RESULTS: Deaths from baseline questionnaire completion through 2012 included 133 myeloid neoplasms, 381 lymphoid neoplasms and 155 leukaemias excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Based on a linear dose-response, no significant ERR/100 mGy occurred for acute myeloid leukaemia (ERR=0.0002, 95% CI <-0.02 to 0.24, p-trend>0.5, 85 cases) or leukaemia excluding CLL (ERR=0.05, 95% CI <-0.09 to 0.24, p-trend=0.21, 155 cases). No significant dose-response trends were observed overall for CLL (ERR<-0.023, 95% CI <-0.025 to 0.18, p-trend=0.45, 32 cases), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (ERR=0.03, 95% CI <-0.2 to 0.18, p-trend=0.4, 201 cases) or multiple myeloma (ERR=0.003, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.16, p-trend>0.5, 112 cases). Findings did not differ significantly by demographic factors, smoking or specific radiological procedures performed. CONCLUSION: After follow-up averaging 22 years, there was little evidence of a relationship between occupational radiation exposure and myeloid or lymphoid haematopoietic neoplasms.","['Linet, Martha S', 'Little, Mark P', 'Kitahara, Cari M', 'Cahoon, Elizabeth K', 'Doody, Michele M', 'Simon, Steven L', 'Alexander, Bruce H', 'Preston, Dale L']","['Linet MS', 'Little MP', 'Kitahara CM', 'Cahoon EK', 'Doody MM', 'Simon SL', 'Alexander BH', 'Preston DL']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1687-5587', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8028-0588', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0641-2925']","['National Cancer Institute Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Bethesda, Maryland, USA linetm@mail.nih.gov.', 'National Cancer Institute Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'National Cancer Institute Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'National Cancer Institute Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'National Cancer Institute Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'National Cancer Institute Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'self-employed at Hirosoft International, Eureka, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20200923,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Aged', 'Allied Health Personnel/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radiation Exposure', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Technology, Radiologic/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC8527846,['NOTNLM'],"['*Ionising radiation', '*epidemiology', '*leukaemia', '*longitudinal studies', '*occupational health practice']",2020/09/25 06:00,2021/04/15 06:00,['2020/09/24 05:28'],"['2019/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/24 05:28 [entrez]']","['oemed-2019-106346 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2019-106346 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2020 Dec;77(12):822-831. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2019-106346.

Three important reasons for inactivity or discontinuation of asparaginase therapy are infusion related reactions (IRRs), pancreatitis and life-threatening central nervous system (CNS). For IRRs, real-time therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and premedication are important aspects to be considered. For pancreatitis and CNS thrombosis one key question is if patients should be re-exposed to asparaginase after their occurrence.An expert panel met during the Congress of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology in Lyon in October 2019 to discuss strategies for diminishing the impact of these three toxicities. The panel agreed that TDM is particularly useful for optimising asparaginase treatment and that when a tight pharmacological monitoring programme is established premedication could be implemented more broadly to minimise the risk of IRR. Re-exposure to asparaginase needs to be balanced against the anticipated risk of leukemic relapse. However, more prospective data are needed to give clear recommendations if to re-expose patients to asparaginase after the occurrence of severe pancreatitis and CNS thrombosis.","['Baruchel, Andre', 'Brown, Patrick', 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Silverman, Lewis', 'van der Sluis, Inge', 'Wolthers, Benjamin Ole', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Baruchel A', 'Brown P', 'Rizzari C', 'Silverman L', 'van der Sluis I', 'Wolthers BO', 'Schmiegelow K']",,"['Universite de Paris, APHP, Hopital Universitaire Robert-Debre, Paris, France.

PI3K regulates the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the myeloid NADPH oxidase NOX2, but the role of PI3Kdelta in myeloid cell-induced immunosuppression is unexplored. We assessed the effects of idelalisib on the spontaneous and IgG antibody-induced ROS production by human monocytes, on ROS-induced cell death of human natural killer (NK) cells, and on tumor cell clearance in an NK cell-dependent mouse model of metastasis. Idelalisib potently and efficiently inhibited the formation of NOX2-derived ROS from monocytes and rescued NK cells from ROS-induced cell death. Idelalisib also promoted NK cell cytotoxicity against anti-CD20-coated primary human CLL cells and cultured malignant B cells. Experiments using multiple PI3K inhibitors implicated the PI3Kdelta isoform in regulating NOX2-induced ROS formation and immunosuppression. In B6 mice, systemic treatment with idelalisib significantly reduced the formation of lung metastases from intravenously injected melanoma cells but did not affect metastasis in B6.129S6-Cybbtm1Din (Nox2 (-/-)) mice or in NK cell-deficient mice. Our results imply that idelalisib rescues NK cells from NOX2/ROS-dependent immunosuppression and thus exerts antineoplastic efficacy beyond B-cell inhibition.","['Akhiani, Ali A', 'Hallner, Alexander', 'Kiffin, Roberta', 'Aydin, Ebru', 'Werlenius, Olle', 'Aurelius, Johan', 'Martner, Anna', 'Thoren, Fredrik B', 'Hellstrand, Kristoffer']","['Akhiani AA', 'Hallner A', 'Kiffin R', 'Aydin E', 'Werlenius O', 'Aurelius J', 'Martner A', 'Thoren FB', 'Hellstrand K']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2395-7529', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6260-4091', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6598-5221', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2167-7451']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Center for Cancer Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Center for Cancer Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Center for Cancer Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Center for Cancer Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Center for Cancer Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Center for Cancer Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Center for Cancer Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. kristoffer.hellstrand@microbio.gu.se.', 'TIMM Laboratory, Sahlgrenska Center for Cancer Research, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200923,United States,Cancer Immunol Res,Cancer immunology research,101614637,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (Cybb protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidase 2/*genetics/immunology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,,,2020/09/25 06:00,2021/10/09 06:00,['2020/09/24 05:27'],"['2020/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/24 05:27 [entrez]']","['2326-6066.CIR-20-0055 [pii]', '10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-20-0055 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Res. 2020 Dec;8(12):1532-1541. doi: 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-20-0055.

However, the genes with significant changes identified by pair-wise comparisons cannot indeed represent the specificity of gene expression across multiple conditions. In addition, the knowledge about the identification of gene expression markers across multiple conditions is still paucity. RESULTS: Herein, we developed a hybrid tool, LinDeconSeq, which consists of 1) identifying marker genes using specificity scoring and mutual linearity strategies across any number of cell types, and 2) predicting cellular fractions of bulk samples using weighted robust linear regression with the marker genes identified in the first stage. On multiple publicly available datasets, the marker genes identified by LinDeconSeq demonstrated better accuracy and reproducibility compared to MGFM and RNentropy. Among deconvolution methods, LinDeconSeq showed low average deviations (</=0.0958) and high average Pearson correlations (>/=0.8792) between the predicted and actual fractions on the benchmark datasets. Importantly, the cellular fractions predicted by LinDeconSeq appear to be relevant in the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The distinct cellular fractions in granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP), lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor (LMPP) and monocytes (MONO) were found to be closely associated with AML compared to the healthy samples. Moreover, the heterogeneity of cellular fractions in AML patients divided these patients into two subgroups, differing in both prognosis and mutation patterns. GMP fraction was the most pronounced between these two subgroups, particularly, in SubgroupA, which was strongly associated with the better AML prognosis and the younger population. Totally, the identification of marker genes by LinDeconSeq represents the improved feature for deconvolution. The data processing strategy with regard to the cellular fractions used in this study also showed potential for the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we developed a freely-available and open-source tool LinDeconSeq ( https://github.com/lihuamei/LinDeconSeq ), which includes marker identification and deconvolution procedures. LinDeconSeq is comparable to other current methods in terms of accuracy when applied to benchmark datasets and has broad application in clinical outcome and disease-specific molecular mechanisms.","['Li, Huamei', 'Sharma, Amit', 'Ming, Wenglong', 'Sun, Xiao', 'Liu, Hongde']","['Li H', 'Sharma A', 'Ming W', 'Sun X', 'Liu H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8768-764X'],"['State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science & Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Bonn, 53127, Bonn, Germany.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science & Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science & Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, China. xsun@seu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, School of Biological Science & Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210096, China. liuhongde@seu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200923,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*classification/metabolism/pathology', '*Software']",PMC7510109,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cellular fractions', 'Deconvolution', 'Diagnosis', 'Marker genes', 'Prognostic', 'Subgroups']",2020/09/25 06:00,2021/04/14 06:00,['2020/09/24 05:25'],"['2019/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/24 05:25 [entrez]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12864-020-06888-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12864-020-06888-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2020 Sep 23;21(1):652. doi: 10.1186/s12864-020-06888-1.,,"['No. 61972084/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'No. 31371339/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The safety profile of tisagenlecleucel still needs to be better defined. The aim of this study was a post-marketing evaluation of the safety of tisagenlecleucel through the analysis of the Eudravigilance database with focus on the paediatric population. From 2017 to 2020, one third of Individual Case Safety Reports referring to tisagenlecleucel (117/364) have been collected in paediatrics, on average nine year-old boys. Overall, 92% of the638 adverse events were serious and caused or prolonged hospitalisation. A total of 55 adverse events presented a fatal outcome, mainly due to progression of malignant neoplasm (N = 10; 18.2%), recurrence of acute lymphocytic leukaemia (N = 6; 10.9%) or occurrence of acute lymphocytic leukaemia (N = 5; 9.1%). Cytokine release syndrome was commonly reported after tisagenlecleucel infusion (54/638), followed by pyrexia (45/638) and hypotension (27/638). Only 18/638 events referred to neurotoxicity, none of them resulted in death. More than one third of cases (41/117) were suggestive of therapeutic failure. This first post-marketing analysis confirms pre-approval evidence of the safety profile of tisagenlecleucel in paediatrics. Since only a few years of marketing is available, further followed-up studies need to be performed to investigate longer-term safety of tisagenlecleucel.","['Rafaniello, Concetta', 'Ferrajolo, Carmen', 'Gaio, Mario', 'Zinzi, Alessia', 'Scavone, Cristina', 'Sullo, Maria Giuseppa', 'Rossi, Francesco', 'Berrino, Liberato', 'Capuano, Annalisa']","['Rafaniello C', 'Ferrajolo C', 'Gaio M', 'Zinzi A', 'Scavone C', 'Sullo MG', 'Rossi F', 'Berrino L', 'Capuano A']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4287-5510'],"['Section of Pharmacology ""L.

In this study, we first evaluated the correlation between expression levels of Wnt molecules and clinical outcome. Then, we studied-in vitro and in vivo-the anti-leukemic value of combinatorial treatment between Wnt inhibitors and classic anti-leukemia drugs. Higher levels of beta-catenin, Ser675-phospho-beta-catenin and GSK-3alpha (total and Ser 9) were found in AML cells from intermediate or poor risk patients; nevertheless, patients presenting high activity of Wnt/beta-catenin displayed shorter progression-free survival (PFS) according to univariate analysis. In vitro, many pharmacological inhibitors of Wnt signalling, i.e., LRP6 (Niclosamide), GSK-3 (LiCl, AR-A014418), and TCF/LEF (PNU-74654) but not Porcupine (IWP-2), significantly reduced proliferation and improved the drug sensitivity of AML cells cultured alone or in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells. In vivo, PNU-74654, Niclosamide and LiCl administration significantly reduced the bone marrow leukemic burden acting synergistically with Ara-C, thus improving mouse survival. Overall, our study demonstrates the antileukemic role of Wnt/beta-catenin inhibition that may represent a potential new therapeutics strategy in AML.","['Takam Kamga, Paul', 'Dal Collo, Giada', 'Cassaro, Adriana', 'Bazzoni, Riccardo', 'Delfino, Pietro', 'Adamo, Annalisa', 'Bonato, Alice', 'Carbone, Carmine', 'Tanasi, Ilaria', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Krampera, Mauro']","['Takam Kamga P', 'Dal Collo G', 'Cassaro A', 'Bazzoni R', 'Delfino P', 'Adamo A', 'Bonato A', 'Carbone C', 'Tanasi I', 'Bonifacio M', 'Krampera M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8586-1381', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7348-370X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5977-7178', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0119-0830', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5168-747X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8177-374X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0716-1686', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7280-2040']","['Section of Hematology, Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'EA4340-BCOH, Biomarker in Cancerology and Onco-Haematology, Universite de Versailles-Saint-Quentin-En-Yvelines, Universite Paris Saclay, 92100 Boulogne-Billancourt, France.', 'Section of Hematology, Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Doctor Molenwaterplein 40, 3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology Unit, Niguarda Hospital, 20162 Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, 20146 Milan, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Diagnostics and Public Health, University and Hospital Trust of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Gemelli, IRCCS, 00168 Roma, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Stem Cell Research Laboratory, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, 37134 Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200921,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7565567,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Wnt', 'drug target', 'microenvironment']",2020/09/25 06:00,2020/09/25 06:01,['2020/09/24 01:01'],"['2020/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/24 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12092696 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12092696 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Sep 21;12(9). pii: cancers12092696. doi: 10.3390/cancers12092696.,,['Bando 2012/Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Verona Vicenza Belluno e Ancona'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to its antibacterial action, it shows many non-antimicrobial effects, including an anti-cancer activity. The anti-cancer action was confirmed in studies on ovarian carcinoma cells, hepatocellular carcinoma cells, glioma cells, or acute myeloid leukemia cells. Malignant melanoma remains a serious medical problem despite the extensive knowledge of the disease. The low effectiveness of the standard treatment, as well as the resistance to therapy, result in high mortality rates. This work aimed to investigate the potential and mechanisms of anti-melanoma action of minocycline. Human skin melanotic melanoma cell line COLO 829 was used in the study. The obtained results showed that minocycline decreased cell viability and inhibited the growth of melanoma cells, proportional to the drug concentration as well as to the time of incubation. The EC50 values were calculated to be 78.6 microM, 31.7 microM, and 13.9 microM for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, respectively. It was observed that treated cells had a disturbed cell cycle and significantly changed morphology. Moreover, minocycline caused a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in cells with a low level of reduced thiols. Finally, it was found that the anti-melanoma effect of minocycline was related to the induction of apoptosis. The drug activated caspases 8, 9, and 3/7 as well as increased the number of annexin V-positive cells. The presented results show that minocycline possesses anti-melanoma potential.","['Rok, Jakub', 'Rzepka, Zuzanna', 'Beberok, Artur', 'Pawlik, Justyna', 'Wrzesniok, Dorota']","['Rok J', 'Rzepka Z', 'Beberok A', 'Pawlik J', 'Wrzesniok D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8260-4339', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2247-3004', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6918-3330']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Sosnowiec, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Jagiellonska 4, 41-200 Sosnowiec, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Sosnowiec, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Jagiellonska 4, 41-200 Sosnowiec, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Sosnowiec, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Jagiellonska 4, 41-200 Sosnowiec, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Sosnowiec, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Jagiellonska 4, 41-200 Sosnowiec, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Sosnowiec, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Jagiellonska 4, 41-200 Sosnowiec, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200921,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FYY3R43WGO (Minocycline)', 'Melanoma, Cutaneous Malignant']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', '*Melanoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*drug effects', 'Minocycline/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', '*Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology']",PMC7555712,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA fragmentation', 'apoptosis', 'caspases', 'cell cycle', 'melanoma', 'minocycline']",2020/09/25 06:00,2021/02/25 06:00,['2020/09/24 01:01'],"['2020/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/24 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21186917 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21186917 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Sep 21;21(18). pii: ijms21186917. doi: 10.3390/ijms21186917.,,"['KNW-2-O26/N/9/K, KNW-1-037/K/9/O/Slaski Uniwersytet Medyczny']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of alterations identified in these patients grows as studies of the disease progress, but in clinical practice, the conventional techniques frequently used are only capable of detecting the most common alterations. However, techniques, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), are being implemented to detect a wide spectrum of new alterations that also include point mutations. METHODS: In this study, we designed and validated a comprehensive custom NGS panel to detect the main genetic alterations present in the disease in a single step. For this purpose, 75 B-ALL diagnosis samples from patients previously characterized by standard-of-care diagnostic techniques were sequenced. RESULTS: The use of the custom NGS panel allowed the correct detection of the main genetic alterations present in B-ALL patients, including the presence of an aneuploid clone in 14 of the samples and some of the recurrent fusion genes in 35 of the samples. The panel was also able to successfully detect a number of secondary alterations, such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variations (CNVs) in 66 and 46 of the samples analyzed, respectively, allowing for further refinement of the stratification of patients. The custom NGS panel could also detect alterations with a high level of sensitivity and reproducibility when the findings obtained by NGS were compared with those obtained from other conventional techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The use of this custom NGS panel allows us to quickly and efficiently detect the main genetic alterations present in B-ALL patients in a single assay (SNVs and insertions/deletions (INDELs), recurrent fusion genes, CNVs, aneuploidies, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with pharmacogenetics). The application of this panel would thus allow us to speed up and simplify the molecular diagnosis of patients, helping patient stratification and management.","['Montano, Adrian', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Jesus', 'Forero-Castro, Maribel', 'Matorra-Miguel, Maria', 'Lumbreras, Eva', 'Miguel, Cristina', 'Santos, Sandra', 'Ramirez-Maldonado, Valentina', 'Fuster, Jose Luis', 'de Las Heras, Natalia', 'Garcia-de Coca, Alfonso', 'Sierra, Magdalena', 'Davila, Julio', 'de la Fuente, Ignacio', 'Olivier, Carmen', 'Olazabal, Juan', 'Martinez, Joaquin', 'Vega-Garcia, Nerea', 'Gonzalez, Teresa', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus Maria', 'Benito, Rocio']","['Montano A', 'Hernandez-Sanchez J', 'Forero-Castro M', 'Matorra-Miguel M', 'Lumbreras E', 'Miguel C', 'Santos S', 'Ramirez-Maldonado V', 'Fuster JL', 'de Las Heras N', 'Garcia-de Coca A', 'Sierra M', 'Davila J', 'de la Fuente I', 'Olivier C', 'Olazabal J', 'Martinez J', 'Vega-Garcia N', 'Gonzalez T', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Benito R']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3178-6726', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5205-8891', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4787-3266', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4881-9440', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5185-2073', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9739-5747', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3190-063X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9781-4198']","['IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (CIC), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (CIC), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Escuela de Ciencias Biologicas (Grupo de investigacion GICBUPTC), Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia, Tunja 150003, Colombia.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (CIC), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (CIC), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (CIC), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (CIC), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (CIC), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Seccion de Oncohematologia Pediatrica, Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca, Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria (IMIB), 30120 Murcia, Spain.', 'Departamento de Hematologia-Hospital Virgen Blanca, 24008 Leon, Spain.', 'Departamento de Hematologia-Hospital Clinico de Valladolid, 47003 Valladolid, Spain.', 'Complejo Sanitario de Zamora, 49022 Zamora, Spain.', 'Departamento de Hematologia-Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Departamento de Hematologia-Hospital Rio Hortega, 47012 Valladolid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia-Complejo Sanitario de Segovia, 40002 Segovia, Spain.', 'Departamento de Hematologia-Hospital Universitario de Burgos, 09006 Burgos, Spain.', 'Departamento de Hematologia-Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, 28041 Madrid, Spain.', 'Laboratorio de Hematologia, Instituto de Investigacion, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, 08950 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Departamento de Hematologia-Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (CIC), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'Departamento de Hematologia-Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, 37007 Salamanca, Spain.', 'IBSAL, IBMCC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (CIC), 37007 Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200921,Switzerland,J Pers Med,Journal of personalized medicine,101602269,,,,PMC7565730,['NOTNLM'],"['NGS', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'diagnosis', 'genetic alterations']",2020/09/25 06:00,2020/09/25 06:01,['2020/09/24 01:01'],"['2020/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/24 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/25 06:01 [medline]']","['jpm10030137 [pii]', '10.3390/jpm10030137 [doi]']",epublish,J Pers Med. 2020 Sep 21;10(3). pii: jpm10030137. doi: 10.3390/jpm10030137.,,"['SA085U16/Consejeria de Educacion, Junta de Castilla y Leon, Fondos FEDER', 'SA271P18/Consejeria de Educacion, Junta de Castilla y Leon, Fondos FEDER', 'GRS 2062/A/19/Regional Council of Castilla y Leon SACYL', 'GRS 1847/A/18/Regional Council of Castilla y Leon SACYL', 'IBY17/00006/Proyectos de investigacion en Biomedicina, gestion sanitaria y', 'atencion sociosanitaria del IBSAL', 'CB16/12/00233/Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer', 'ERAPERMED2018-275/Synthetic Lethality for Personalized Therapy-based', 'Stratification In Acute Leukemia', 'AC18/00093/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'Adrian Montano/Fundacion Cientifica Asociacion Espanola Contra el Cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, CD19 CAR T cells fail to induce durable responses in most patients. Second infusions of CD19 CAR T cells (CART2) have been considered as a possible approach to improve outcomes. We analyzed data from 44 patients with R/R B-cell malignancies (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], n = 14; chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], n = 9; non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL], n = 21) who received CART2 on a phase 1/2 trial (NCT01865617) at our institution. Despite a CART2 dose increase in 82% of patients, we observed a low incidence of severe toxicity after CART2 (grade >/=3 cytokine release syndrome, 9%; grade >/=3 neurotoxicity, 11%). After CART2, complete response (CR) was achieved in 22% of CLL, 19% of NHL, and 21% of ALL patients. The median durations of response after CART2 in CLL, NHL, and ALL patients were 33, 6, and 4 months, respectively. Addition of fludarabine to cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion before the first CAR T-cell infusion (CART1) and an increase in the CART2 dose compared with CART1 were independently associated with higher overall response rates and longer progression-free survival after CART2. We observed durable CAR T-cell persistence after CART2 in patients who received cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (Cy-Flu) lymphodepletion before CART1 and a higher CART2 compared with CART1 cell dose. The identification of 2 modifiable pretreatment factors independently associated with better outcomes after CART2 suggests strategies to improve in vivo CAR T-cell kinetics and responses after repeat CAR T-cell infusions, and has implications for the design of trials of novel CAR T-cell products after failure of prior CAR T-cell immunotherapies.","['Gauthier, Jordan', 'Bezerra, Evandro D', 'Hirayama, Alexandre V', 'Fiorenza, Salvatore', 'Sheih, Alyssa', 'Chou, Cassie K', 'Kimble, Erik L', 'Pender, Barbara S', 'Hawkins, Reed M', 'Vakil, Aesha', 'Phi, Tinh-Doan', 'Steinmetz, Rachel N', 'Jamieson, Abby W', 'Bar, Merav', 'Cassaday, Ryan D', 'Chapuis, Aude G', 'Cowan, Andrew J', 'Green, Damian J', 'Kiem, Hans-Peter', 'Milano, Filippo', 'Shadman, Mazyar', 'Till, Brian G', 'Riddell, Stanley R', 'Maloney, David G', 'Turtle, Cameron J']","['Gauthier J', 'Bezerra ED', 'Hirayama AV', 'Fiorenza S', 'Sheih A', 'Chou CK', 'Kimble EL', 'Pender BS', 'Hawkins RM', 'Vakil A', 'Phi TD', 'Steinmetz RN', 'Jamieson AW', 'Bar M', 'Cassaday RD', 'Chapuis AG', 'Cowan AJ', 'Green DJ', 'Kiem HP', 'Milano F', 'Shadman M', 'Till BG', 'Riddell SR', 'Maloney DG', 'Turtle CJ']",,"['Clinical Research Division and.', 'Integrated Immunotherapy Research Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA;

This study examined the efficacy of targeting HDAC3 combined with MG-132 as a possible therapeutic strategy for B-ALL patients. METHODS: Real-time PCR and western blot were used to measure the expression of smurf2 and HDAC3 from B-ALL patients bone marrow samples. Sup-B15 and CCRF-SB cells were treated with MG-132, small interfering RNA of smurf2 or HDAC3. A plasmid designed to up-regulate smurf2 expression was transfected into B-ALL cells. Flow cytometry and western blot were used to measure variation due to these treatments in terms of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. RESULTS: Expression of Smurf2 and HDAC3 mRNA were inversely related in B-ALL patients. Up-regulation of smurf2 or MG-132 influenced HDAC3, further inhibiting the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signal pathway and inducing apoptosis in B-ALL cells. When we treated Sup-B15 and CCRF-SB cells with siHDAC3 and MG-132 for 24 h, silencing HDAC3 enhanced the apoptosis rate induced by MG-132 in B-ALL cells and further inhibited the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Furthermore, MG-132 was observed to cause G2/M phase arrest in B-ALL cells and inhibited the JAK/STAT3 pathway, leading to apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Silencing of HDAC3 enhanced the sensitivity of B-ALL cells to MG-132. The combination of targeting HDAC3 and MG-132 may provide a new avenue for clinical treatment of acute B lymphocytic leukaemia and improve the poor survival of leukaemia patients.","['Guo, Yongling', 'Li, Xinyao', 'He, Zhengchang', 'Ma, Dan', 'Zhang, Zhaoyuan', 'Wang, Weili', 'Xiong, Jie', 'Kuang, Xinyi', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Guo Y', 'Li X', 'He Z', 'Ma D', 'Zhang Z', 'Wang W', 'Xiong J', 'Kuang X', 'Wang J']",,"['School of Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guiyang Hospital of Guizhou Aviation Industry Group, Guiyang, China.', 'School of Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'School of Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, China.', 'School of Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, China.', 'School of Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang, China, wangjishi9646@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200923,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (SMURF2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylases/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leupeptins/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'HDAC3', 'MG-132', 'Prognosis']",2020/09/24 06:00,2021/06/05 06:00,['2020/09/23 20:08'],"['2019/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/23 20:08 [entrez]']","['000500713 [pii]', '10.1159/000500713 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2020;65(3-4):85-100. doi: 10.1159/000500713.

A 2-year-old, intact male, mixed-breed cat was presented with alopecia, skin peeling, and erythematous swelling in the left metacarpal paw pad. Swelling, softening, ulceration with secondary crusts, and erythematous to violaceous discoloration were observed in multiple metacarpal, metatarsal, and digital paw pads. Complete blood count and serum biochemistry were analyzed. FeLV antigenemia and FIV seropositivity were assessed by immunoassay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Nested-PCR was used to detect FIV and FeLV proviral DNA in blood cells. Histopathological examination and anti-FeLV and anti-FIV immunohistochemical were performed on paw pad biopsies. According to clinical and histopathological findings, a diagnosis of plasma cell pododermatitis was made. The cat was FIV and FeLV seropositive. The immunohistochemical of paw pad biopsies revealed FeLV positivity and FIV negativity. This study provides reference for further investigations about feline plasma cell pododermatitis and highlights retrovirus infection as a potential factor associated with this disease.","['Biezus, Giovana', 'de Cristo, Thierry Grima', 'da Silva Schade, Michele Ferraz', 'Ferian, Paulo Eduardo', 'Carniel, Felipe', 'Miletti, Luiz Claudio', 'Maciel, Aline da Rosa', 'Casagrande, Renata Assis']","['Biezus G', 'de Cristo TG', 'da Silva Schade MF', 'Ferian PE', 'Carniel F', 'Miletti LC', 'Maciel ADR', 'Casagrande RA']",,"['Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Santa Catarina State, Av.

An AML expert panel, consisting of both transplant and nontransplant experts, was invited to develop clinically relevant frequently asked questions covering disease- and HCT-related topics. A systematic literature review was conducted to generate core recommendations that were graded based on the quality and strength of underlying evidence based on the standardized criteria established by the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Steering Committee for evidence-based reviews. Allogeneic HCT offers a survival benefit in patients with intermediate- and high-risk AML and is currently a part of standard clinical care. We recommend the preferential use of myeloablative conditioning in eligible patients.

Multiple cardiovascular adverse events (CVEs) associated with CAR-Ts have been observed in small studies, but no large-scale studies exist. Leveraging the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS), we identified all reported adverse events (AEs) associated with CAR-T therapy (tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel) from 2017 to 2019. Reports with missing age and sex were excluded. CVEs were classified into arrhythmias, heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), and other CVEs. Logistic regression and hierarchical clustering were used to identify factors associated with CVEs. A total of 996 reported AEs were observed (39.1% associated with tisagenlecleucel and 60% with axicabtagene ciloleucel). Of all patients experiencing AEs, the median age was 54 (interquartile range, 21 to 65) years; 38.9% were females. In total, 19.7% (196) of all AEs reported to the FDA were CVEs. The most common CVEs were arrhythmia (77.6%), followed by HF (14.3%) and MI (0.5%). In adjusted analysis a positive association was observed between those presenting with CVE with neurotoxicity (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.20 to 2.60; P=.004). Additionally, when both CVE and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) are present, neurotoxicity is the most common noncardiac AE, which clusters with them (Jaccard similarity: 73.1). The mortality rate was 21.1% overall but 30.1% for those reporting CVEs. In FAERS, reported CVEs with CAR-T are associated with high reported mortality. The development of either CRS or neurotoxicity should prompt vigilance for cardiovascular events.","['Guha, Avirup', 'Addison, Daniel', 'Jain, Prantesh', 'Gutierrez, Jahir M', 'Ghosh, Arjun', 'Roddie, Claire', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Al-Kindi, Sadeer', 'Oliveira, Guilherme H']","['Guha A', 'Addison D', 'Jain P', 'Gutierrez JM', 'Ghosh A', 'Roddie C', 'de Lima M', 'Al-Kindi S', 'Oliveira GH']",,"['Harrington Heart and Vascular Institute, University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Cardio-Oncology Program, Division of Cardiology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio; Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospitals of Cleveland and Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Layer6 Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', ""Cardio-Oncology Service, Bart's Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, United Kingdom; Cardio-Oncology Service, University College London Hospital, Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, London, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Hematology, University College London Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospitals of Cleveland and Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Harrington Heart and Vascular Institute, University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Cardio-Oncology Program, Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa General Hospital and Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.

We have studied the contribution of nestin(+) BM mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) to MLL-AF9-driven acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development and chemoresistance in vivo. Unlike bulk stroma, nestin(+) BMSC numbers are not reduced in AML, but their function changes to support AML cells, at the expense of non-mutated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Nestin(+) cell depletion delays leukemogenesis in primary AML mice and selectively decreases AML, but not normal, cells in chimeric mice. Nestin(+) BMSCs support survival and chemotherapy relapse of AML through increased oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, and glutathione (GSH)-mediated antioxidant defense. Therefore, AML cells co-opt energy sources and antioxidant defense mechanisms from BMSCs to survive chemotherapy.","['Forte, Dorian', 'Garcia-Fernandez, Maria', 'Sanchez-Aguilera, Abel', 'Stavropoulou, Vaia', 'Fielding, Claire', 'Martin-Perez, Daniel', 'Lopez, Juan Antonio', 'Costa, Ana S H', 'Tronci, Laura', 'Nikitopoulou, Efterpi', 'Barber, Michael', 'Gallipoli, Paolo', 'Marando, Ludovica', 'Fernandez de Castillejo, Carlos Lopez', 'Tzankov, Alexandar', 'Dietmann, Sabine', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Catani, Lucia', 'Curti, Antonio', 'Vazquez, Jesus', 'Frezza, Christian', 'Huntly, Brian J', 'Schwaller, Juerg', 'Mendez-Ferrer, Simon']","['Forte D', 'Garcia-Fernandez M', 'Sanchez-Aguilera A', 'Stavropoulou V', 'Fielding C', 'Martin-Perez D', 'Lopez JA', 'Costa ASH', 'Tronci L', 'Nikitopoulou E', 'Barber M', 'Gallipoli P', 'Marando L', 'Fernandez de Castillejo CL', 'Tzankov A', 'Dietmann S', 'Cavo M', 'Catani L', 'Curti A', 'Vazquez J', 'Frezza C', 'Huntly BJ', 'Schwaller J', 'Mendez-Ferrer S']",,"['Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, CB2 0AW Cambridge, UK; National Health Service Blood and Transplant, CB2 0PT Cambridge, UK; Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica, Diagnostica e Sperimentale, Universita degli Studi, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, CB2 0AW Cambridge, UK; National Health Service Blood and Transplant, CB2 0PT Cambridge, UK.', 'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', ""University Children's Hospital and Department of Biomedicine (DBM), University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland."", 'Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, CB2 0AW Cambridge, UK; National Health Service Blood and Transplant, CB2 0PT Cambridge, UK.', 'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), 28029 Madrid, Spain; CIBER de Enfermedades Cardiovasculares (CIBERCV), Madrid, Spain.', 'MRC Cancer Unit, University of Cambridge, CB2 0XZ Cambridge, UK.', 'MRC Cancer Unit, University of Cambridge, CB2 0XZ Cambridge, UK.', 'MRC Cancer Unit, University of Cambridge, CB2 0XZ Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, CB2 0AW Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, CB2 0AW Cambridge, UK; Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, CB2 0AW Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, CB2 0AW Cambridge, UK; Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, CB2 0AW Cambridge, UK.', 'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.', 'Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, CB2 0AW Cambridge, UK.', 'Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica, Diagnostica e Sperimentale, Universita degli Studi, 40138 Bologna, Italy; Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, via Albertoni 15, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica, Diagnostica e Sperimentale, Universita degli Studi, 40138 Bologna, Italy; Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, via Albertoni 15, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, via Albertoni 15, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), 28029 Madrid, Spain; CIBER de Enfermedades Cardiovasculares (CIBERCV), Madrid, Spain.', 'MRC Cancer Unit, University of Cambridge, CB2 0XZ Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, CB2 0AW Cambridge, UK; Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, CB2 0AW Cambridge, UK.', ""University Children's Hospital and Department of Biomedicine (DBM), University of Basel, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.

In the present study, we describe the flow cytometric features at diagnosis with special attention to the distribution of monocytic subsets and the relation between MFC and molecular subgroups. MFC was performed with an eight-colour platform based on Euroflow. We studied 33 JMML cases. CD34(+) /CD117(+) /CD13(+) cells >2% was found in 25 cases, and 51.5% presented an aberrant expression of CD7. A decrease of CD34(+) /CD19(+) /CD10(+) cells was seen in eight cases and in four they were absent. The granulocytic population had a decreased side scatter in 29 cases. Bone marrow monocytic precursors were increased in 28 patients, with a decrease in classical monocytes (median 80.7%) and increase in CD16(+) (intermediate and non-classical). A more pronounced increase in myeloid CD34(+) cells was seen in patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11), with aberrant CD7 expression in four of six and 10/12 patients respectively. Thus, JMML shows an immunophenotypic profile similar to myelodysplastic syndromes, and a different monocyte subset distribution when compared with chronic MML. MFC proved to be an important diagnostic tool that can help in differential diagnosis with other clonal diseases with monocytosis.","['Frisanco Oliveira, Anita', 'Tansini, Aline', 'Toledo, Thais Regina', 'Balceiro, Rafael', 'Onofre Vidal, Daniel', 'de Martino Lee, Maria Lucia', 'Lorand-Metze, Irene', 'Lopes, Luiz Fernando']","['Frisanco Oliveira A', 'Tansini A', 'Toledo TR', 'Balceiro R', 'Onofre Vidal D', 'de Martino Lee ML', 'Lorand-Metze I', 'Lopes LF']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2681-9359', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0019-0209', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1626-8944', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2117-3640', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6516-1265', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9737-9245']","[""Barretos Children's Cancer Hospital, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil."", 'Brazilian Co-operative Study Group for Paediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome (GCB-SMD-PED) - Morphology and Flow Cytometry Committee, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', ""Barretos Children's Cancer Hospital, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil."", 'GCB-SMD-PED - Flow cytometry Committee, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', ""Barretos Children's Cancer Hospital, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil."", 'GCB-SMD-PED - Flow cytometry Committee, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', ""Barretos Children's Cancer Hospital, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil."", 'Brazilian Co-operative Study Group for Paediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome (GCB-SMD-PED) - Morphology and Flow Cytometry Committee, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'GCB-SMD-PED - Molecular Biology and Genetic Committee, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', ""Barretos Children's Cancer Hospital, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil."", 'GCB-SMD-PED - Morphology and Myeloproliferative Diseases Committee, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Brazilian Co-operative Study Group for Paediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome (GCB-SMD-PED) - Morphology and Flow Cytometry Committee, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'GCB-SMD-PED - Chairman, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', ""Barretos Children's Cancer Hospital, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil."", 'GCB-SMD-PED - Chairman, Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200923,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis/genetics/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Male']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CMML', '*flow cytometry', '*juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia', '*molecular subtypes', '*myelodysplastic syndrome']",2020/09/24 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2020/09/23 17:36'],"['2020/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/23 17:36 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17098 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Jan;192(1):129-136. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17098.

The aim was to investigate the association between ELF-MF exposure and the risk of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). A case-control study was conducted in Mexico City during the period from 2010 to 2011. Residential 24-h ELF-MF measurements were obtained for 290 incident B-ALL patients and 407 controls, aged less than 16 years. Controls were frequency-matched by sex, age (+/-18 months), and health institution. The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. ELF-MF exposure at <0.2 muT was used to define the reference group. ELF-MF exposure at >/=0.3 muT was observed in 11.3% of the controls. Different ELF-MF intensity cutoff values were used to define the highest exposure category; the highest exposure category for each cutoff value was associated with an increased risk of B-ALL compared with the corresponding lower exposure categories. The aORs were as follows: >/=0.2 muT = 1.26 (95% CI: 0.84-1.89); >/=0.3 muT = 1.53 (95% CI: 0.95-2.48); >/=0.4 muT = 1.87 (95% CI: 1.04-3.35); >/=0.5 muT = 1.80 (95% CI 0.95-3.44); >/=0.6 muT = 2.32 (95% CI: 1.10-4.93). ELF-MF exposure as a continuous variable (per 0.2 muT intervals) was associated with B-ALL risk (aOR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01-1.12). In the present study, the proportion of children exposed to >/=0.3 muT is among the highest reported worldwide. Additionally, an ELF-MF exposure >/=0.4 muT may be associated with the risk of B-ALL.

METHODS: We consecutively recruited 168 patients with AML from three tertiary hospitals to complete two rounds of interviews using the two versions of the EQ-5D. We compared (i) the ceiling effect using the McNemar's test, (ii) test-retest reliability using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cohen's weighted Kappa, (iii) convergent validity using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r) and iv) discriminatory ability using F statistic and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of the 5L and the 3L. RESULTS: The 5L descriptive system showed significantly lower ceiling effects in comparison to the 3L descriptive system (p < 0.001). While 5L showed superior reproducibility (Cohen's weighted Kappa = 0.56-0.67 and ICC = 0.89), both instruments exhibited good test-retest reliability. Even though both 3L and 5L showed good convergent and known-groups validity, 5L showed better convergent validity and discriminatory ability. CONCLUSION: The current study found both 3L and 5L to be suitable for use in AML patients. However, 5L showed superior measurement properties compared to 3L. Thus, 5L could be the preferred instrument over 3L for use in AML patients.","['Yu, Hongjuan', 'Zeng, Xueyun', 'Sui, Mingjie', 'Liu, Rui', 'Tan, Rachel Lee-Yin', 'Yang, Jinjin', 'Huang, Weidong', 'Luo, Nan']","['Yu H', 'Zeng X', 'Sui M', 'Liu R', 'Tan RL', 'Yang J', 'Huang W', 'Luo N']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2798-4735'],"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001, China.', 'Southern University of Science and Technology Hospital, Shenzhen, 518000, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, China.', 'National University Singapore Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Bejing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, Beijing, 102218, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150086, China. weidong218@126.com.', 'National University Singapore Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200923,Netherlands,Qual Life Res,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",9210257,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Psychometrics/*methods', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cancer', 'EQ-5D-3L', 'EQ-5D-5L', 'Measurement property']",2020/09/24 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2020/09/23 12:14'],"['2020/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/23 12:14 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11136-020-02644-w [doi]', '10.1007/s11136-020-02644-w [pii]']",ppublish,Qual Life Res. 2021 Mar;30(3):855-866. doi: 10.1007/s11136-020-02644-w.

The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of miR-223 in ALL and its underlying molecular mechanisms. METHODS: The mRNA expression of miR-223 and FOXO1 was detected by qRT-RCR in ALL children. The correlation between miR-223 and clinical indexes of ALL was determined. CCRF-CEM and NALM-6 cells were transfected with miR-223 mimic and miR-223 inhibitor, respectively. The proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration of CCRF-CEM and NALM-6 cells were measured by MTT, flow cytometry and transwell assay. The protein expression of FOXO1 was detected by Western blot. Additionally, dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assay were performed to investigate the target gene of miR-223 and validate their targeting relationship. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of miR-223 was markedly down-regulated in ALL, but FOXO1 was up-regulated. The protein expression of FOXO1 was highly expressed in CCRF-CEM and NALM-6 cells. The expression of miR-223 was related to WBC, PLT, RBC and risk stratification. Overexpression of miR-223 not only inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, but also induced cell apoptosis. Importantly, FOXO1 was a target gene of miR-223 in ALL cells. Silencing of FOXO1 reversed the effects of miR-223 inhibitor on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis in ALL. CONCLUSIONS: miR-223 could inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promote apoptosis by targeting FOXO1 in ALL.","['Li, Chunyu', 'Zhao, Tana', 'Nie, Lei', 'Zou, Yanhong', 'Zhang, Quan']","['Li C', 'Zhao T', 'Nie L', 'Zou Y', 'Zhang Q']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jiamusi University, No. 348 dexiang Street, Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province 154002, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jiamusi University, No. 348 dexiang Street, Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province 154002, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jiamusi University, No. 348 dexiang Street, Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province 154002, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jiamusi University, No. 348 dexiang Street, Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province 154002, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Jiamusi Central Hospital, No. 256, Zhongshan Street, Xiangyang District, Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province 154002, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (FOXO1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O1)', '0 (MIRN223 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Apoptosis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC7538682,['NOTNLM'],"['*FOXO1', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*cell apoptosis', '*cell proliferation', '*miR-223', '*migration and invasion']",2020/09/24 06:00,2021/03/31 06:00,['2020/09/23 09:03'],"['2020/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/23 09:03 [entrez]']","['226491 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20200485 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosci Rep. 2020 Oct 30;40(10). pii: 226491. doi: 10.1042/BSR20200485.,['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few cases were reported but no modern case series is available in the literature. METHODS: Peripheral blood smears from patients diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) at our institution were reviewed. Relevant clinical and pathologic parameters were collected and compared with reported cases in the literature. RESULTS: Seven patients were identified over a period of 8 years. All patients were males with a median age of 35 years. The diagnosis was classic HL in six (86%) patients and nodular lymphocyte predominant in one (14%). All patients presented with anemia (100%), and six (86%) had leukopenia and lymphopenia. Circulating Hodgkin cells were few in number and ranged between 2% and 10% of total white blood cells. Mononuclear Hodgkin cells were more common than binucleated Reed-Sternberg cells. All patients were in stage IV disease (100%). Six patients (86%) died within one year of identifying these cells. CONCLUSIONS: Hodgkin cell leukemia is very rare and represents a terminal event in the course of the disease of any histologic subtype.

Recently, second-generation or next-generation sequencing (NGS), which allows simultaneous sequencing of hundreds to billions of DNA strands, has been a focus of attention and is rapidly being adopted in various fields. In the present study, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of gastric MALT lymphoma (n=1) and small intestine MALT lymphoma (n=4) were selected, and DNA was extracted from the tissue samples. After performing quality control, NGS was performed using HemaSCAN, a custom panel of 426 genes, including essential blood cancer genes. NGS revealed single nucleotide variations (SNVs), short insertions and deletions (InDels) and copy number variations (CNVs). These genomic variants were reported as annotated, known or novel variants. An annotated variant, an erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 gene amplification, was observed in one patient. Known and novel variants, including SNVs of SET binding protein 6 (SETBP6), Runt-related transcription factor 1 and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 genes, InDel of the marker of proliferation Ki-67 gene, and CNVs of the zinc finger protein 703 and NOTCH1 genes, were observed in >/=2 patients. Additionally, InDels with frameshift mutations were identified in the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10, DEAD-box helicase 3 X-linked, forkhead box O3 and mucin 2, oligomeric mucus/gel-forming genes in one patient. Since few NGS studies have been performed on MALT lymphoma, the current results were unable to determine if the different mutations that were identified are 'actionable' (that is, potentially responsive to a targeted therapy) Further studies are required to determine the associations between genetic mutations and the development of MALT lymphoma.","['Huh, Seok Jae', 'Oh, Sung Yong', 'Lee, Suee', 'Lee, Ji Hyun', 'Kim, Sung Hyun', 'Pak, Min Kyung', 'Kim, Hyo-Jin']","['Huh SJ', 'Oh SY', 'Lee S', 'Lee JH', 'Kim SH', 'Pak MK', 'Kim HJ']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Seo-gu, Busan 49201, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Seo-gu, Busan 49201, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Seo-gu, Busan 49201, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Seo-gu, Busan 49201, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Seo-gu, Busan 49201, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Seo-gu, Busan 49201, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Seo-gu, Busan 49201, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200908,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,PMC7491050,['NOTNLM'],"['gene', 'mucosal-associated lymphoid lymphoma', 'mutation', 'next-generation sequencing']",2020/09/24 06:00,2020/09/24 06:01,['2020/09/23 06:34'],"['2019/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/23 06:34 [entrez]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2020.12068 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-12068 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2020 Nov;20(5):205. doi: 10.3892/ol.2020.12068.

However, the contribution of signaling pathways that lead to metabolic disorders and NE differentiation of prostate cancer remains unclear. In this study, we identified that ADT induced upregulation of the succinate-CoA ligase GDP-forming beta subunit (SUCLG2), which regulates succinate metabolism and NE differentiation of prostate cancer. We demonstrated a connection that upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) signaling induced SUCLG2 expression in prostate cancer cells. The LIFR is upregulated by nuclear EGFR, which acts as a transcriptional regulator, directly binds to the LIFR promoter, and drives NE differentiation and glycolysis of prostate cancer. LIFR upregulation is associated with SUCLG2, which increased succinate synthesis and enzymatic activities of mitochondrial nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) in prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of SUCLG2 suppressed NE differentiation in cultured cells and reduced prostate tumor growth in a xenograft model. Analysis of prostate tissue samples showed increased intensity of nuclear EGFR associated with the LIFR and SUCLG2 in castration-resistant prostate cancer tumors. Our study provides a mechanism whereby ADT upregulates EGFR-LIFR signaling that activates SUCLG2, which subsequently stimulates the metabolic changes associated with NE differentiation and aggressive prostate cancer phenotype.","['Lin, Shian-Ren', 'Wen, Yu-Ching', 'Yeh, Hsiu-Lien', 'Jiang, Kuo-Ching', 'Chen, Wei-Hao', 'Mokgautsi, Ntlotlang', 'Huang, Jiaoti', 'Chen, Wei-Yu', 'Liu, Yen-Nien']","['Lin SR', 'Wen YC', 'Yeh HL', 'Jiang KC', 'Chen WH', 'Mokgautsi N', 'Huang J', 'Chen WY', 'Liu YN']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7267-6868', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3660-8045', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3102-8482']","['Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Information System and Applications, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. 1047@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. 1047@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. liuy@tmu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA. liuy@tmu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200922,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (AR protein, human)', '0 (Androgen Antagonists)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 6.2.1.- (SUCLG2 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.- (Succinate-CoA Ligases)']",IM,"['Androgen Antagonists/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Cell Transdifferentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glycolysis/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Prostate/drug effects/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Androgen/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Succinate-CoA Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,2020/09/24 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/09/23 06:32'],"['2020/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/23 06:32 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-020-01468-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-020-01468-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2020 Oct;39(44):6757-6775. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-01468-9.

These epigenetic alterations could have important implications for understanding and predicting the risk of smoking-related diseases. To this end, it is important to establish if these DNA methylation changes happen in all blood cell subtypes or if they are cell-type specific. Here, we apply a cell-type deconvolution algorithm to identify cell-type specific DNA methylation signals in seven large EWAS. We find that most of the highly reproducible smoking-associated hypomethylation signatures are more prominent in the myeloid lineage. A meta-analysis further identifies a myeloid-specific smoking-associated hypermethylation signature enriched for DNase Hypersensitive Sites in acute myeloid leukemia. These results may guide the design of future smoking EWAS and have important implications for our understanding of how smoking affects immune-cell subtypes and how this may influence the risk of smoking related diseases.","['You, Chenglong', 'Wu, Sijie', 'Zheng, Shijie C', 'Zhu, Tianyu', 'Jing, Han', 'Flagg, Ken', 'Wang, Guangyu', 'Jin, Li', 'Wang, Sijia', 'Teschendorff, Andrew E']","['You

METHODS: We obtained the corrected-incidence data for invasive cancers newly diagnosed from 2008 through 2015 from the Fukushima Cancer Registry. We checked data quality indicators for PBCRs to confirm comparability. We calculated age-standardized annual incidence and mortality of cancer for all-site, thyroid, and leukemia by calendar year and sex, as we did for Tochigi Prefecture and all of Japan as references for comparison. We applied joinpoint trend analysis to test an apparent trend in incidence and mortality. RESULTS: The corrected incidence data from the Fukushima Cancer Registry had sufficient quality comparable to other PBCRs. For the age-standardized annual incidence by sex and cancer type in Fukushima and Tochigi, we did not detect any joinpoint in trend with statistical significance. Cancer incidence gently increased from 2008 through 2015 nationwide. Incidence and mortality of cancer for Fukushima before the accident was very close to that for Tochigi. CONCLUSIONS: We interpreted the incidence statistics of cancer for Fukushima residents from 2008 through 2015. Our results will provide fundamental statistics for subsequent researchers to assess the relationship between the disaster and cancer incidence among Fukushima residents in the long term.","['Shibata, Akiko', 'Saji, Shigehira', 'Kamiya, Kenji', 'Yasumura, Seiji']","['Shibata A', 'Saji S', 'Kamiya K', 'Yasumura S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8655-5837', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4715-2840']","['Center for Cancer Control and Information Services, National Cancer Center.', 'Radiation Medical Science Center for the Fukushima Health Management Survey, Fukushima Medical University.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine.', 'Radiation Medical Science Center for the Fukushima Health Management Survey, Fukushima Medical University.', 'Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University.', 'Radiation Medical Science Center for the Fukushima Health Management Survey, Fukushima Medical University.', 'Department of Public Health, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210218,Japan,J Epidemiol,Journal of epidemiology,9607688,,IM,"['*Disasters', '*Earthquakes', '*Fukushima Nuclear Accident', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', '*Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology']",PMC8593570,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*incidence', '*population-based cancer registry']",2020/09/24 06:00,2021/12/25 06:00,['2020/09/23 06:29'],"['2020/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/23 06:29 [entrez]']",['10.2188/jea.JE20200202 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol. 2021 Dec 5;31(12):653-659. doi: 10.2188/jea.JE20200202.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional design using SEER-CAHPS(R) data from 2002 to 2015 to study Medicare fee-for-service enrollees with a primary diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma. We linked the CAHPS survey data (patient-reported experiences with health services) to patients' cancer registry information and Medicare outpatient claims from the SEER-CAHPS resource. We estimated associations of ED use and clinical characteristics with two CAHPS outcomes - ""getting care quickly"" (timeliness) and ""getting needed care"" (access) - with bivariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The analytic sample included 751 patients, 125 of whom had an ED claim in the first year of cancer diagnosis. The most frequent ED diagnosis clusters were fever and infection (n = 17, 13.6%), orthopedic and injury (16, 12.8%) and pain (16, 12.8%). Significantly more enrollees with an ED claim were diagnosed with lymphoma (p < 0.01), lived in rural areas (p < 0.01), and lived in areas with many families living in poverty (p < 0.01). In adjusted models, enrollees with an ED claim reported significantly worse access to care (beta - 4.83; 95%CI -9.29,-0.38; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The management of urgent care concerns for adults with hematologic malignancies remains an important clinical and quality improvement imperative. Further study is warranted to enhance the management of emergent complications in older adults receiving care for hematologic malignancies, with efforts that enhance coordination of ambulatory oncology care.","['Fauer, Alex', 'Wallner, Lauren P', 'Davis, Matthew A', 'Choi, Sung Won', 'Friese, Christopher R']","['Fauer A', 'Wallner LP', 'Davis MA', 'Choi SW', 'Friese CR']",,"['University of Michigan, School of Nursing, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America; University of Michigan, School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Children, ages 2-18, with a leukemia, lymphoma, or solid tumor diagnosis were recruited from a top cancer center in Guangzhou, China. Socio-demographic information, clinical information were collected, while nutritional status using SGNA, malnutrition risk using STRONGkids, and QOL of these children were measured. Descriptive analyses, Chi(2)-tests, ANOVA and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze data. RESULTS: Among included participants, 55.8% of them were malnourished, and 74.2% of them had moderate to high risk of malnutrition. The overall QOL and subscales were associated with nutritional status. In the logistic-regression model, high malnutrition risk, patients' mother having primary school education or less, worse physical functioning quality of life, and lower BMI level were strongly associated with malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of malnutrition in children with cancer is high, which related to worse QOL. Patients' BMI, physical functioning QOL and mothers' educational level could help to predict their nutritional status. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: STRONGkids and SGNA could be widely used in mainland China. Health professionals should pay attention to patients with lower BMI and physical functioning scores, and patients' mother having primary school education or less.","['Ouyang, Na', 'Lu, Xia', 'Cai, Ruiqing', 'Liu, Meiling', 'Liu, Ke']","['Ouyang N', 'Lu X', 'Cai R', 'Liu M', 'Liu K']",,"['School of Nursing, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong, China.', 'School of Nursing, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangdong, China.', 'School of Nursing, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong, China.

We report a case of a 6-month-old female infant with mosaic monosomy 7 who presented with clinical and laboratory evidences of immunodeficiency. The patient had suffered from recurrent respiratory infections since she was born. Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets revealed an extremely low level of CD19(+) B lymphocytes (0.3 approximately 0.8%, normal range: 6.4 approximately 22.6%) and a decreased CD4/CD8 ratio (0.67 approximately 1.12, normal range: 1.4 approximately 2.0). Decreased serum levels of IgG (1.53g/L, normal range: 4.09 approximately 7.03g/L), IgA (0.10g/L, normal range: 0.21 approximately 0.47g/L) and IgM (0.26g/L, normal range: 0.33 approximately 0.73g/L) were detected, while complements were normal. Excepting transient neutropenia, routine blood tests were within normal limits. Clinical exome sequencing identified a de novo mosaic monosomy 7, while no pathogenic mutation associated with immunodeficiency was detected. However, peripheral blood cytogenetic analysis was failure to detect monosomy 7 due to the very few cell mitosis. Subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) identified a mosaic monosomy 7 in 58 cells within a total number of 100 cells, which was consistent with clinical exome sequencing. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) due to mosaic monosomy 7. Intravenous treatment with multiple antibiotic agents and infusion of gamma globulin could control the patient's respiratory infections effectively. A better understanding of PIDs will enable effective treatments and prevention of infections in these patients.","['Mai, Kailin', 'Chen, Xiaowen', 'Wang, Chunli', 'Wu, Shangzhi', 'Yang, Liying', 'Huang, Zhanhang', 'Zhang, Guanglin', 'Zhang, Victor Wei', 'Wang, Jing', 'Chen, Dehui']","['Mai K', 'Chen X', 'Wang C', 'Wu S', 'Yang L', 'Huang Z', 'Zhang G', 'Zhang VW', 'Wang J', 'Chen D']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'AmCare Genomics Lab (V.W.Z.), Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'AmCare Genomics Lab (V.W.Z.), Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Human and Molecular Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, USA.', 'AmCare Genomics Lab (V.W.Z.), Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.

Yet how SMCs contribute to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis remains elusive. METHODS: To reveal the trajectories of SMC transdifferentiation during atherosclerosis and to identify molecular targets for disease therapy, we combined SMC fate mapping and single-cell RNA sequencing of both mouse and human atherosclerotic plaques. We also performed cell biology experiments on isolated SMC-derived cells, conducted integrative human genomics, and used pharmacological studies targeting SMC-derived cells both in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: We found that SMCs transitioned to an intermediate cell state during atherosclerosis, which was also found in human atherosclerotic plaques of carotid and coronary arteries. SMC-derived intermediate cells, termed ""SEM"" cells (stem cell, endothelial cell, monocyte), were multipotent and could differentiate into macrophage-like and fibrochondrocyte-like cells, as well as return toward the SMC phenotype. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling was identified as a regulator of SMC to SEM cell transition, and RA signaling was dysregulated in symptomatic human atherosclerosis. Human genomics revealed enrichment of genome-wide association study signals for coronary artery disease in RA signaling target gene loci and correlation between coronary artery disease risk alleles and repressed expression of these genes. Activation of RA signaling by all-trans RA, an anticancer drug for acute promyelocytic leukemia, blocked SMC transition to SEM cells, reduced atherosclerotic burden, and promoted fibrous cap stability. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of cell-specific fate mapping, single-cell genomics, and human genetics adds novel insights into the complexity of SMC biology and reveals regulatory pathways for therapeutic targeting of SMC transitions in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.","['Pan, Huize', 'Xue, Chenyi', 'Auerbach, Benjamin J', 'Fan, Jiaxin', 'Bashore, Alexander C', 'Cui, Jian', 'Yang, Dina Y', 'Trignano, Sarah B', 'Liu, Wen', 'Shi, Jianting', 'Ihuegbu, Chinyere O', 'Bush, Erin C', 'Worley, Jeremy', 'Vlahos, Lukas', 'Laise, Pasquale', 'Solomon, Robert A', 'Connolly, Edward S', 'Califano, Andrea', 'Sims, Peter A', 'Zhang, Hanrui', 'Li, Mingyao', 'Reilly, Muredach P']","['Pan H', 'Xue C', 'Auerbach BJ', 'Fan J', 'Bashore AC', 'Cui J', 'Yang DY', 'Trignano SB', 'Liu W', 'Shi J', 'Ihuegbu CO', 'Bush EC', 'Worley J', 'Vlahos L', 'Laise P', 'Solomon RA', 'Connolly ES', 'Califano A', 'Sims PA', 'Zhang H', 'Li M', 'Reilly MP']",,"['Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine (H.P., C.X., A.C.B., J.C., D.Y.Y., S.B.T., W.L., J.S., C.O.I., H.Z., M.P.R.), Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine (H.P., C.X., A.C.B., J.C., D.Y.Y., S.B.T., W.L., J.S., C.O.I., H.Z., M.P.R.), Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York.', 'Graduate Group in Genomics and Computational Biology (B.J.A.), University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics (J.F., M.L.), University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine (H.P., C.X., A.C.B., J.C., D.Y.Y., S.B.T., W.L., J.S., C.O.I., H.Z., M.P.R.), Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine (H.P., C.X., A.C.B., J.C., D.Y.Y., S.B.T., W.L., J.S., C.O.I., H.Z., M.P.R.), Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine (H.P., C.X., A.C.B., J.C., D.Y.Y., S.B.T., W.L., J.S., C.O.I., H.Z., M.P.R.), Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine (H.P., C.X., A.C.B., J.C., D.Y.Y., S.B.T., W.L., J.S., C.O.I., H.Z., M.P.R.), Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine (H.P., C.X., A.C.B., J.C., D.Y.Y., S.B.T., W.L., J.S., C.O.I., H.Z., M.P.R.), Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine (H.P., C.X., A.C.B., J.C., D.Y.Y., S.B.T., W.L., J.S., C.O.I., H.Z., M.P.R.), Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine (H.P., C.X., A.C.B., J.C., D.Y.Y., S.B.T., W.L., J.S., C.O.I., H.Z., M.P.R.), Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York.', 'Department of Systems Biology (E.C.B., J.W., L.V., P.L.

Until now, the diagnosis has been based on morphological grounds only, possibly making the real frequency of the disease underestimated. Only recently, new insights in the molecular biology of MDS/MPN syndromes have deepened our knowledge of aCML, enabling us to have a better molecular profile of the disease. The knowledge gleaned from next generation sequencing has complemented morphologic and laboratory WHO criteria for myeloid neoplasms and can provide greater specificity in distinguishing aCML from alternative MDS/MPN or MPNs. The most commonly mutated genes (>20%) in aCML are SETBP1, ASXL1, N/K-RAS, SRSF2, and TET2, and less frequently (< 10%) CBL, CSFR3, JAK2, EZH2, and ETNK1. Several of these mutations affect the JAK-STAT, MAPK, and ROCK signaling pathways, which are targetable by inhibitors that are already in clinical use and may lead to a personalized treatment of aCML patients unfit for allogeneic transplant, which is currently the only curative option for fit patients. In this review, we present two emblematic clinical cases and address the new molecular findings in aCML and the available treatment options.","['Crisa, Elena', 'Nicolosi, Maura', 'Ferri, Valentina', 'Favini, Chiara', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Patriarca, Andrea']","['Crisa E', 'Nicolosi M', 'Ferri V', 'Favini C', 'Gaidano G', 'Patriarca A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1912-0574', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4681-0151']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Universita del Piemonte Orientale and Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Maggiore della Carita, Via Solaroli 17, 28100 Novara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20200918,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/therapy', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Mutation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC7555965,['NOTNLM'],"['Atypical CML', 'next generation sequencing', 'target therapy']",2020/09/24 06:00,2021/03/16 06:00,['2020/09/23 01:03'],"['2020/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/23 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21186862 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21186862 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Sep 18;21(18). pii: ijms21186862. doi: 10.3390/ijms21186862.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In leukemia, the transcriptional activation of EVI1 usually results from chromosomal rearrangements. Besides leukemia, EVI1 has also been linked to solid tumors including breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and colon cancer. The MDS1/EVI1 gene is encoded by the same locus as EVI1. While EVI1 functions as a transcription repressor, MDS1/EVI1 acts as a transcription activator. The fusion protein encoded by the AML1/MDS1/EVI1 chimeric gene, resulting from chromosomal translocations in a subset of chronic myeloid leukemia, exhibits a similar function to EVI1. EVI1 has been shown to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, whereas the functions of MDS1/EVI1 and AML1/MDS1/EVI1 remain elusive.

Ruxolitinib, a JAK/STAT inhibitor, has proved a useful addition to the therapeutic arsenal for these disorders, but has limited disease modifying activity. We determined the effect of JAK inhibition on the histone landscape of MPN cells in cell line models of MPNs and validated using samples from the MAJIC randomised clinical trial of ruxolitinib in polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia. We demonstrated an epigenetic modifying effect of ruxolitinib using a histone modification assay. The majority of 21 histone H3 modifications were upregulated, with H3K27me3 and H3K36me2 significant in the combined cell line results. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CHIP-seq) for three marks of interest, H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, was consistent with the histone modification assay showing a significant increase in H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peaks at promoter regions, both marks of active transcription. In contrast, RNA sequencing demonstrates a coordinated reduction in gene expression in a number of cell pathways including PI3K-AKT signalling, transcriptional misregulation in cancer and JAK-STAT signalling in spite of these histone changes. This highlights the complex mechanisms of transcriptional control within the cells which was reflected in analysis of the histone landscape in patient samples following ruxolitinib treatment.","['Greenfield, Graeme', 'McPherson, Suzanne', 'Smith, James', 'Mead, Adam', 'Harrison, Claire', 'Mills, Ken', 'McMullin, Mary Frances']","['Greenfield G', 'McPherson S', 'Smith J', 'Mead A', 'Harrison C', 'Mills K', 'McMullin MF']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2333-1374', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0773-0204']","[""Blood Cancer Research Group, Patrick G Johnston Centre for Cancer Research, Queen's University, Belfast BT9 7AE, UK."", ""Blood Cancer Research Group, Patrick G Johnston Centre for Cancer Research, Queen's University, Belfast BT9 7AE, UK."", ""Blood Cancer Research Group, Patrick G Johnston Centre for Cancer Research, Queen's University, Belfast BT9 7AE, UK."", 'Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, Institute of Cancer Research, London SW7 3RP, UK.', 'MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Guys and St Thomas Hospital, London SE1 9RT, UK.', ""Blood Cancer Research Group, Patrick G Johnston Centre for Cancer Research, Queen's University, Belfast BT9 7AE, UK."", ""Centre for Medical Education, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast BT9 7BL, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200918,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7563593,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK inhibition', 'epigenetics', 'histone modification', 'myeloproliferative neoplasms']",2020/09/24 06:00,2020/09/24 06:01,['2020/09/23 01:02'],"['2020/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/23 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/24 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12092669 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12092669 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Sep 18;12(9). pii: cancers12092669. doi: 10.3390/cancers12092669.,,"['MR/L006340/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'R2058CNR/Leukaemia and Lymphoma NI', 'R2536CNR/Leukaemia and Lymphoma NI']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ovarian cancer (OVCAR-3) and chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (K-562) are used for this study. The correlation of protein expression with percentage of cells in each phase (G1, S and G2 phase) was evaluated through FACS. Cells were synchronized in G1, G2 and mitotic phase to evaluate gene (RT-qPCR) and protein expression (FACS). Real-time immune cell attack (RTICA) analysis with PBMCs (peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells) and cancer cells were performed. We found that cells expressing higher levels of HLA-G and PD-L1 are mainly in G2 phase and those expressing lower levels are mainly in G1 phase. Evidently, the higher expression of the two proteins was observed when synchronized in mitotic phase as compared to low expression when synchronized in G1 phase. RTICA analysis showed the presence of HLA-G delayed the lysis of the cells. In conclusion, the cancer cell can escape from immune cells in division stage that suggests the impact of mitosis index for cancer immunotherapy.","['Ullah, Matti', 'Aoudjeghout, Warda', 'Pimpie, Cynthia', 'Pocard, Marc', 'Mirshahi, Massoud']","['Ullah M', 'Aoudjeghout W', 'Pimpie C', 'Pocard M', 'Mirshahi M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5253-1538', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1950-3321', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1007-2502']","['CAP-Paris Tech., INSERM U1275, Hopital Lariboisiere, 2, rue Ambroise-Pare, 75010 Paris, France.', 'CAP-Paris Tech., INSERM U1275, Hopital Lariboisiere, 2, rue Ambroise-Pare, 75010 Paris, France.', 'CAP-Paris Tech., INSERM U1275, Hopital Lariboisiere, 2, rue Ambroise-Pare, 75010 Paris, France.', 'CAP-Paris Tech., INSERM U1275, Hopital Lariboisiere, 2, rue Ambroise-Pare, 75010 Paris, France.', 'CAP-Paris Tech., INSERM U1275, Hopital Lariboisiere, 2, rue Ambroise-Pare, 75010 Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200918,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7564851,['NOTNLM'],"['HLA-G', 'PD-L1', 'cell cycle', 'immune resistance', 'mitosis']",2020/09/24 06:00,2020/09/24 06:01,['2020/09/23 01:02'],"['2020/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/23 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/24 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12092661 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12092661 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Sep 18;12(9). pii: cancers12092661. doi: 10.3390/cancers12092661.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ach., CI, Cladina mitis Sandst., CM, Hypogymnia physodes (L.) Nyl., HP). The ability to scavenge free radicals was evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods and the total phenolic content was determined by Folin-Ciocalteu (F-C) test. In the case of DPPH % of inhibition was higher for selected species (Pseudevernia furfuracea (L.) Zopf, H. physodes in comparison to the literature data.

In this study, we screened the effect of meisoindigo on a panel of 300 protein kinases and found that it selectively inhibited Stat3-associated tyrosine kinases and further confirmed its activity in cell based assays. To gain a deeper insight into the structure-activity relationship we produced 7 bromo-derivatives exhausting the accessible positions on the bisindole backbone except for in the 4-position due to the space limitation. We compared their anti-proliferative effects on tumor cells. We found that 6-bromomeisoindigo showed improved toxicity in company with increased Stat3 inhibition. Moreover, we detected that 6-bromomeisoindigo induced apoptosis of 95% of CD133+ pancreatic cancer cells. Considering that CD133 is a common marker highly expressed in a range of CSCs, our results imply the potential application of 6-bromomeisoindigo for the treatment of CSCs in different types of cancers.","['Tegethoff, Jana', 'Bischoff, Roland', 'Saleh, Sawsan', 'Blagojevic, Biljana', 'Merz, Karl-Heinz', 'Cheng, Xinlai']","['Tegethoff J', 'Bischoff R', 'Saleh S', 'Blagojevic B', 'Merz KH', 'Cheng X']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6441-3742'],"['Department of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Division of Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry, Division of Food Chemistry and Toxicology, University of Kaiserslautern, Erwin-Schrodinger-Strasse 52, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Division of Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Division of Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry, Division of Food Chemistry and Toxicology, University of Kaiserslautern, Erwin-Schrodinger-Strasse 52, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Division of Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170913,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,,IM,,PMC6151689,['NOTNLM'],"['Stat3 inhibitor', 'TCM', 'cancer stem cells', 'indirubin', 'meisoindigo', 'selective protein kinase inhibitor', 'structure-activity-relationship']",2017/09/13 00:00,2017/09/13 00:01,['2020/09/23 01:01'],"['2017/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2017/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/23 01:01 [entrez]', '2017/09/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/13 00:01 [medline]']","['molecules22091546 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules22091546 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2017 Sep 13;22(9). pii: molecules22091546. doi: 10.3390/molecules22091546.,,['CH 1690/2-1/DFG'],['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somatic events shape morphologic features, but the complexity of morphologic and genetic changes makes clear associations challenging. This article interrogates novel clinical subtypes of MDS using a machine-learning technique devised to identify patterns of cooccurrence among morphologic features and genomic events. We sequenced 1079 MDS patients and analyzed bone marrow morphologic alterations and other clinical features. A total of 1929 somatic mutations were identified. Five distinct morphologic profiles with unique clinical characteristics were defined. Seventy-seven percent of higher-risk patients clustered in profile 1. All lower-risk (LR) patients clustered into the remaining 4 profiles: profile 2 was characterized by pancytopenia, profile 3 by monocytosis, profile 4 by elevated megakaryocytes, and profile 5 by erythroid dysplasia. These profiles could also separate patients with different prognoses. LR MDS patients were classified into 8 genetic signatures (eg, signature A had TET2 mutations, signature B had both TET2 and SRSF2 mutations, and signature G had SF3B1 mutations), demonstrating association with specific morphologic profiles. Six morphologic profiles/genetic signature associations were confirmed in a separate analysis of an independent cohort. Our study demonstrates that nonrandom or even pathognomonic relationships between morphology and genotype to define clinical features can be identified. This is the first comprehensive implementation of machine-learning algorithms to elucidate potential intrinsic interdependencies among genetic lesions, morphologies, and clinical prognostic in attributes of MDS.","['Nagata, Yasunobu', 'Zhao, Ran', 'Awada, Hassan', 'Kerr, Cassandra M', 'Mirzaev, Inom', 'Kongkiatkamon, Sunisa', 'Nazha, Aziz', 'Makishima, Hideki', 'Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Scott, Jacob G', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Hobbs, Brian P', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Nagata Y', 'Zhao R', 'Awada H', 'Kerr CM', 'Mirzaev I', 'Kongkiatkamon S', 'Nazha A', 'Makishima H', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Scott JG', 'Sekeres MA', 'Hobbs BP', 'Maciejewski JP']",,"['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences and.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences and.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; and.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences and.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', '*Machine Learning', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*pathology']",PMC7702479,,,2020/09/23 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/09/22 20:24'],"['2020/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/22 20:24 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)79926-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020005488 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Nov 12;136(20):2249-2262. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020005488.,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['R01 HL128425/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL118281/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 HL135795/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL123904/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL132071/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Blood. 2020 Nov 12;136(20):2243-2244.

Studies and epidemiological data regarding viral infections in children with cancer in developing countries are lacking. This retrospective cohort study aims to assess the burden of viral infections in children and adolescents with cancer, by assessing prevalence, risk factors, as well as morbidity and mortality of common viruses over a period of 8 years. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Medical records of cancer patients treated at the Children Cancer Center of Lebanon were reviewed and 155 participants under the age of 21 were identified with at least one documented viral infection during the period from July 2009 to November 2017. This subset included 136 participants with active malignancy and 19 participants with a history of cancer who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT] and were in remission; the latter group was analyzed separately. Information regarding participant characteristics, hospital course, and complications were obtained. Associations between viral infections and certain factors were assessed. In the cohort, 64% were male, 81% were Lebanese. In participants with active malignancy, 90% received chemotherapy in the 6 months preceding the viral infection episode, 11% received radiotherapy. 51% of participants were neutropenic at the time of viral detection, and 77% were lymphopenic. 17% experienced a bacterial co-infection, and 3 experienced a viral co-infection. Among 162 viral infection episodes, clinically diagnosed skin infections, mainly herpes simplex virus type 1 and varicella-zoster virus, were the most common [44% of cases]. These were followed by laboratory-proven systemic herpes infections: cytomegalovirus [14%] and Epstein-Barr virus [6%]. Respiratory viruses: influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, accounted for 9% and 4%, respectively, whereas rotavirus represented 11% and BK virus represented 3% of cases. Acute lymphocytic leukemia was the most prevalent neoplasia [57%]. Fever was the most common presenting symptom [55%] and febrile neutropenia was the reason for admission in 24% of cases. The mean length of stay was significantly longer in participants with cytomegalovirus infections and significantly lower in rotavirus infection. Admission to the ICU occurred in 9%, complications in 8%, and mortality in 5%. Participants with viral infections post-HSCT were noted to have a significantly longer length of hospital stay compared to non-HSCT participants, with no other significant differences in clinical course and outcome. The study was limited by its retrospective nature and by the late introduction and underuse of multiplex PCR panels, which may have led to underdiagnosis of viral infections. CONCLUSIONS: Viral infections were prevalent in our sample of cancer patients and may have contributed to morbidity and mortality. Newly available viral diagnostics are likely to vastly increase the number and scope of detectable viral infections in this population. Prospective studies using multiplex PCR technology with systematic testing of patients will be more helpful in defining the burden of viral infections. Furthermore, efforts at antimicrobial stewardship would benefit from the identification of viral causes of infection and limit the unnecessary use of antibiotics in the pediatric cancer population.","['Chamseddine, Sarah', 'Chmaisse, Ahmad', 'Akel, Imad', 'Zein, Zeinab El', 'Khalil, Suzan', 'Raad, Sarah Abi', 'Khati, Antoine', 'Ghandour, Hiba', 'Khafaja, Sarah', 'Haj, Magda',

Broadening the chemical diversity of Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors with novel chemical entities possessing favorable target potency and cellular efficacy is a current medical demand for CML treatment. In this respect, a new series of ethynyl bearing 3-aminoindazole based Bcr-Abl inhibitors has been designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated. The target compounds were designed based on introducing the key structural features of ponatinib, alkyne spacer and diarylamide, into the previously reported indazole II to improve its Bcr-Abl inhibitory activity and overcome its poor cellular potency. All target compounds elicited potent activity against Bcr-Abl(WT) with sub-micromolar IC50 values ranging 4.6-667 nM. In addition, certain derivatives exhibited promising potency over the clinically imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl(T315I). Among the target molecules, compounds 9c, 9h and 10c stood as the most potent derivatives with IC50 values of 15.4 nM, 4.6 nM, and 25.8 nM, respectively, against Bcr-Abl(WT). Interestingly, 9h showed 2 folds and 3.6 times superior potency to the lead indazole II and 10c, respectively, against Bcr-Abl(T315I). Molecular docking of 9h pointed out its possibility to be a type II kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, all compounds, except 9b, showed highly potent antiproliferative activity against the Bcr-Abl positive leukemia K562 cell (MTT assay) surpassing the modest activity of lead indazole II. Moreover, the most potent members 9h and 10c exerted potent antileukemic activity against NCI leukemia panel, particularly K562 cell (SRB assay) with GI50 less than 10 nM, being superior to the FDA approved drug imatinib. Further biochemical hERG and cellular toxicity, phosphorylation assay, and NanoBRET target engagement of 9h underscored its merits as a promising candidate for CML therapy.","['El-Damasy, Ashraf K', 'Jin, Heewon', 'Seo, Seon Hee', 'Bang, Eun-Kyoung', 'Keum, Gyochang']","['El-Damasy AK', 'Jin H', 'Seo SH', 'Bang EK', 'Keum G']",,"['Center for Neuro-Medicine, Brain Science Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Seoul, 02792, Republic of Korea; Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, Mansoura, 35516, Egypt.

Viral metagenomic technique is useful for identification of viral pathogens potentially existing in bone marrow specimens from hematologic patients. METHODS: A total of 24 patients were included in this study, including 14 female (58.3 %) and 10 male patients (41.7 %) with a mean age of 55.20 +/- 18.02 years (16-89 years).Twenty-four bone marrow specimens were collected from 24 hematologic patients (diagnosed with hypoferric anemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelo-monocytic leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia with maturation, multiple myeloma, lymphoma angioimmunoblastic T cell, acute myeloid leukemia-M1, polycythemia vera/hypoferric anemia, leukocythemia, or megaloblastic anemia). Viral nucleic acid from marrow samples of hematologic patients were subjected to viral metagenomic analysis. PCR method was used to investigate the prevalence of these new viruses in this cohort of hematologic patients. Phylogenetic tree was established to elucidate the relationship of anelloviruses found here and the previously define ones. RESULTS: Anelloviridae family are the main group of viruses detected in all the 4 libraries. Forty-six different species of Anelloviruses belonging to genera Alphatorquevirus, Betatorquevirus and Gammatorquevirus and unclassified anellovirus were recovered. Fifteen novel strains with complete ORF1 coding sequence were acquired and phylogenetically analyzed, indicating 8 of the 15 strains are proposed novel species belonging to genus Gammatorquevirus. Nested-PCR were then performed for these15 novel anellovirus strains in the 24 individual bone marrow samples, which showed 13 of them were present in more than one bone marrow samples. CONCLUSIONS: Diverse types of anellovirus were present in bone marrow samples of hematologic patients. Whether these novel anelloviruses have association with certain hematonosis needs further investigation.","['Wang, Xiao-Chun', 'Wang, Hao', 'Tan, Shi-Dong', 'Yang, Shi-Xing', 'Shi, Xiao-Feng', 'Zhang, Wen']","['Wang XC', 'Wang H', 'Tan SD', 'Yang SX', 'Shi XF', 'Zhang W']",,"['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, 212013, China.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Huai'an Hospital, Xuzhou Medical University, Huai'an 223002, China.

The median age of the cohort was 58 years. High-risk cytogenetics were found in 50% of the patients. All patients received a proteasome inhibitor and/or immunomodulatory drug-based regimen before transplantation. At the time of transplantation, 10 patients (62%) obtained at least a very good partial response (VGPR). The response after autoSCT (3 months) was at least a VGPR in 6 patients (67%; complete response [CR] in 5). All patients undergoing alloSCT achieved a CR at 3 months. Maintenance therapy was provided to 5 patients (56%) after autoSCT. The median progression-free survival after transplantation was 6 months in the autoSCT group, compared with 18 months in the alloSCT group (P = .09), and median overall survival (OS) after transplantation in the 2 groups was 19 months and 40 months, respectively (P = .41).

To improve the purity and the quantity of the infused Tregs, good manufacturing practices (GMP)-compatible expansion protocols are needed. Here we expanded Tregs using an automated, clinical-grade protocol. Cells were extensively characterized in vitro, and their efficiency was tested in vivo in a mouse model. Tregs were selected by CliniMacs (CD4(+)CD25(+), 94.5 +/- 6.3%; FoxP3(+), 63.7 +/- 11.5%; CD127(+), 20 +/- 3%; suppressive activity, 60 +/- 7%), and an aliquot of 100 x 10(6) was expanded for 14 days using the CliniMACS Prodigy System, obtaining 684 +/- 279 x 10(6) cells (CD4(+)CD25(+), 99.6 +/- 0.2%; FoxP3(+), 82 +/- 8%; CD127(+), 1.1 +/- 0.8%; suppressive activity, 75 +/- 12%). CD39 and CTLA4 expression levels increased from 22.4 +/- 12% to 58.1 +/- 13.3% (P < .05) and from 20.4 +/- 6.7% to 85.4 +/- 9.8% (P < .01), respectively. TIM3 levels increased from .4 +/- .05% to 29 +/- 16% (P < .05). Memory Tregs were the prevalent population, whereas naive Tregs almost disappeared at the end of the culture. mRNA analysis displayed significant increases in CD39, IL-10, granzyme B, and IL-35 levels at the end of culture period (P < .05). Conversely, IFNgamma expression decreased significantly by day +14. Expanded Tregs were sorted according to TIM3, CD39, and CD62L expression levels (purity >95%). When sorted populations were analyzed, TIM3(+) cells showed significant increases in IL-10 and granzyme B (P < .01) .When expanded Tregs were infused in an NSG murine model, mice that received Tcons only died of GVHD, whereas mice that received both Tcons and Tregs survived without GVHD. GMP grade expanded cells that display phenotypic and functional Treg characteristics can be obtained using a fully automated system. Treg suppression is mediated by multiple overlapping mechanisms (eg, CTLA-4, CD39, IL-10, IL-35, TGF-beta, granzyme B). TIM3(+) cells emerge as a potentially highly suppressive population.

Therapeutic drug monitoring is necessary due to substantial interindividual variation in MTX clearance. Common function-altering polymorphisms in SLCO1B1 (encodes OATP1B1, which transports MTX) may contribute to clearance variability. We performed pharmacokinetic modeling using data for 106 children and young adults treated with HD MTX for hematologic malignancies; of 396 total courses of HD MTX, 360 consisted of 5 g/m(2) over 24 hours. We evaluated the contribution of clinical covariates and SLCO1B1 genotype (388A>G and 521T>C) to MTX clearance variability. Of the clinical covariates studied, patient weight improved the pharmacokinetic model most significantly (P < 0.001). The addition of the SLCO1B1 variants individually further improved the model (P < 0.05 for each). An interaction between these variants was suggested when both were included (P = 0.017). SLCO1B1 genotype should be considered in efforts to personalize HD MTX dosing.","['Schulte, Rachael R', 'Choi, Leena', 'Utreja, Nipun', 'Van Driest, Sara L', 'Stein, C Michael', 'Ho, Richard H']","['Schulte RR', 'Choi L', 'Utreja N', 'Van Driest SL', 'Stein CM', 'Ho RH']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of General Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200925,United States,Clin Transl Sci,Clinical and translational science,101474067,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1)', '0 (SLCO1B1 protein, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*drug therapy', 'Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1/*genetics', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Pharmacogenomic Testing/statistics & numerical data', 'Pharmacogenomic Variants', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Young Adult']",PMC7877862,,,2020/09/23 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2020/09/22 17:13'],"['2020/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/22 17:13 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cts.12879 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transl Sci. 2021 Jan;14(1):343-353. doi: 10.1111/cts.12879.

Selective ligands for the BCL-2 family regulators of apoptosis are useful as probes to understand cell biology and apoptotic signalling pathways, and as starting points for inhibitor design. We have used phage display to isolate Affimer reagents (non-antibody-binding proteins based on a conserved scaffold) to identify ligands for MCL-1, BCL-xL , BCL-2, BAK and BAX, then used multiple biophysical characterisation methods to probe the interactions. We established that purified Affimers elicit selective recognition of their target BCL-2 protein. For anti-apoptotic targets BCL-xL and MCL-1, competitive inhibition of their canonical protein-protein interactions is demonstrated. Co-crystal structures reveal an unprecedented mode of molecular recognition; where a BH3 helix is normally bound, flexible loops from the Affimer dock into the BH3 binding cleft. Moreover, the Affimers induce a change in the target proteins towards a desirable drug-bound-like conformation. These proof-of-concept studies indicate that Affimers could be used as alternative templates to inspire the design of selective BCL-2 family modulators and more generally other protein-protein interaction inhibitors.","['Miles, Jennifer A', 'Hobor, Fruzsina', 'Trinh, Chi H', 'Taylor, James', 'Tiede, Christian', 'Rowell, Philip R', 'Jackson, Brian R', 'Nadat, Fatima A', 'Ramsahye, Pallavi', 'Kyle, Hannah F', 'Wicky, Basile I M', 'Clarke, Jane', 'Tomlinson, Darren C', 'Wilson, Andrew J', 'Edwards, Thomas A']","['Miles JA', 'Hobor F', 'Trinh CH', 'Taylor J', 'Tiede C', 'Rowell PR', 'Jackson BR', 'Nadat FA', 'Ramsahye P', 'Kyle HF', 'Wicky BIM', 'Clarke J', 'Tomlinson DC', 'Wilson AJ', 'Edwards TA']",,"['School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Astbury Centre For Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Astbury Centre For Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Astbury Centre For Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Astbury Centre For Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Astbury Centre For Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Astbury Centre For Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Astbury Centre For Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Protein Production Facility, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Astbury Centre For Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Protein Production Facility, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Astbury Centre For Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Astbury Centre For Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, UK.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Astbury Centre For Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Astbury Centre For Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.', 'Astbury Centre For Structural Molecular Biology, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201102,Germany,Chembiochem,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*analysis/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'bcl-X Protein/*analysis/metabolism']",PMC7821230,['NOTNLM'],"['*Affimers', '*BCL-2 family', '*chemical biology', '*non-antibody-binding proteins', '*protein-protein interactions']",2020/09/23 06:00,2021/09/24 06:00,['2020/09/22 17:13'],"['2020/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/22 17:13 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbic.202000585 [doi]'],ppublish,Chembiochem. 2021 Jan 5;22(1):232-240. doi: 10.1002/cbic.202000585.

A potential solution to some of these is the use of dry, pre-mixed antibodies, such as the ClearLLab 10C system. The purpose of the present study was to compare the diagnostic performance of the ClearLLab 10C B cell tube with that of our standard laboratory practice. METHODS: We compared the diagnoses made with the ClearLLab 10C B cell tube (experimental strategy) with those made with standard laboratory practice (standard strategy). Samples were selected aiming for representation of the full spectrum of B cell disorders, with an emphasis on mature B cell malignancies, as well as healthy controls. RESULTS: We included 116 samples (34 normal controls, 4 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 54 mature lymphoproliferative disorders in peripheral blood and bone marrow, 3 myelomas, 6 bone marrow samples with involvement by lymphoma and 1 with elevated hematogone count, 14 lymph node samples, 1 cerebrospinal fluid, and 1 pleural effusion).

For example, germline variation in GATA2, encoding a vital transcriptional regulator of multilineage hematopoiesis, creates a predisposition to bone marrow failure and acute myeloid leukemia termed GATA2 deficiency syndrome. More than 300 GATA2 variants representing missense, truncating, and noncoding enhancer mutations have been documented. Although these variants can diminish GATA2 expression and/or function, the functional ramifications of many variants are unknown. Studies using genetic rescue and knockin mouse systems have established that GATA2 mutations differentially affect molecular processes in distinct target genes and within a single target cell. Considering that target genes for a transcription factor can differ in sensitivity to altered levels of the factor, and transcriptional mechanisms are often cell type specific, the context-dependent consequences of GATA2 mutations in experimental systems portend the complex phenotypes and interindividual variation of GATA2 deficiency syndrome. This review documents GATA2 human genetics and the state of efforts to traverse from physiological insights to pathogenic mechanisms.","['Bresnick, Emery H', 'Jung, Mabel M', 'Katsumura, Koichi R']","['Bresnick EH', 'Jung MM', 'Katsumura KR']",,"['Wisconsin Blood Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'Wisconsin Blood Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'Wisconsin Blood Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', '*GATA2 Deficiency', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics', '*Hematologic Diseases', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mutation']",PMC7509867,,,2020/09/23 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/22 17:12'],"['2020/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/22 17:12 [entrez]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31541-X [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002953 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Sep 22;4(18):4584-4592. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002953.,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['R01 DK068634/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK050107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK068634/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK050107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors sought to evaluate the influence of a standardized best practice central venous catheter (CVC) maintenance bundle on the burden of and risk factors for mucosal barrier injury (MBI) and non-MBI central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) across a common inpatient and ambulatory continuum in this high-risk population. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with underlying malignancy, hematologic disorders, and HCT recipients with a CVC in place at the time of CLABSI diagnosis in both inpatient and ambulatory settings from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2016. Descriptive, nonparametric statistics were used to describe patient characteristics and outcomes. Logistic regression analyses were applied to identify potential risk factors for inpatient versus ambulatory and MBI versus non-MBI CLABSI. RESULTS: During the 5-year period, 118 of 808 (14.6%) patients had 159 laboratory-confirmed CLABSIs for ambulatory and inpatient CLABSI rates of 0.27 CLABSI/1000 and 2.2 CLABSI/1000 CVC days, respectively. CLABSI occurred more frequently in hospitalized patients after HCT and with underlying leukemia, most frequently caused by Gram-negative bacteria. MBI CLABSI accounted for 42% of all CLABSI with a 3-fold higher risk in hospitalized patients. Having multiple CVC or a CVC that was not a port independently associated with higher CLABSI risk. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, non-MBI CLABSI continued to account for the majority of CLABSI. CVC type is independently associated with higher overall CLABSI risk. Further studies are needed to reliably define additional prevention strategies when CLABSI maintenance bundles elements are optimized in this high-risk population.","['Ardura, Monica I', 'Bibart, Mindy J', 'Mayer, Lauren C', 'Guinipero, Terri', 'Stanek, Joseph', 'Olshefski, Randal S', 'Auletta, Jeffery J']","['Ardura MI', 'Bibart MJ', 'Mayer LC', 'Guinipero T', 'Stanek J', 'Olshefski RS', 'Auletta JJ']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases.', 'Host Defense Program.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Infectious Diseases.', 'Host Defense Program.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care/statistics & numerical data', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Catheter-Related Infections/etiology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Central Venous Catheters/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Inpatients/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data"", 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/etiology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Young Adult']",,,,2020/09/23 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/09/22 17:11'],"['2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/22 17:11 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001950 [doi]', '00043426-202101000-00025 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Jan;43(1):e64-e72. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001950.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to explore the potential influence of immune mechanisms in SPC. METHODS: We used the Swedish Cancer Registry (1990-2015) to select 13 male and 14 female first primary cancers (FPCs) that are known to be related to immune suppression. We assessed relative risks (RRs) for any of these as concordant (same first and second cancer) and discordant FPC-SPC pairs. Hierarchical clustering of significant RRs was performed for cancers as FPC and SPC. RESULTS: Concordant risks for SPCs were excessive in men and women for nasal (RRs 59.3 for men and 150.6 for women), tongue/mouth (51.7 and 100.8), and lip (32.4 and 61.2) cancers. Heatmaps showed that some cancers, such as skin cancer, tongue/mouth cancers, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma had multiple bidirectional associations as FPC and SPC. Nasal cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia had associations mainly as FPC while liver and kidney cancers showed most associations as SPC. CONCLUSIONS: Immune dysfunction may be a plausible contributing factor for most of the associations, which calls for experimental verification.","['Zheng, Guoqiao', 'Sundquist, Kristina', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Forsti, Asta', 'Hemminki, Akseli', 'Hemminki, Kari']","['Zheng G', 'Sundquist K', 'Sundquist J', 'Forsti A', 'Hemminki A', 'Hemminki K']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4337-9017', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7103-8530', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2769-3316']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Community-based Healthcare Research and Education (CoHRE), Department of Functional Pathology, School of Medicine, Shimane University, Shimane, Japan.', 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Community-based Healthcare Research and Education (CoHRE), Department of Functional Pathology, School of Medicine, Shimane University, Shimane, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', ""Hopp Children's Cancer Center (KiTZ), Heidelberg, Germany."", 'Division of Pediatric Neurooncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Cancer Gene Therapy Group, Translational Immunology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Center in Pilsen, Charles University in Prague, Pilsen, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200922,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/*immunology', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",PMC7643639,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer risk', '*immune suppression', '*multiple cancers', '*risk factors']",2020/09/23 06:00,2021/05/06 06:00,['2020/09/22 12:14'],"['2020/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/22 12:14 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3454 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2020 Nov;9(21):8258-8265. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3454.

This retrospective analysis aimed to investigate the outcomes associated with HSCT, and the risks of HSCT in children and adolescents with nonremission acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: Data from the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation registry on 325 patients with nonremission ALL (aged <21 years, with blasts in the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow) who had undergone HSCT between January 2001 and December 2015 were evaluated. To assess survival, we developed a scoring system using significant adverse pre-HSCT variables. RESULTS: Overall, 247 patients died. The median length of follow up among survivors was 1145 days, and the 3-year overall survival was 22% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18-27%). A low performance score, presence of >25% bone marrow blasts, T-cell phenotype, poor-risk or normal cytogenetics, and history of HSCT were predictors of a poor outcome. Patients scoring 0-1 (n = 109), 2 (n = 91), and 3-7 (n = 125) had a 3-year overall survival of 41% (95% CI: 31-51%), 21% (95% CI: 13-31%), and 7% (95% CI: 3-12%), respectively. CONCLUSION: These results support HSCT in certain nonremission patients. Even in patients without complete remission, outcomes differed according to pre-HSCT factors. A scoring system could help determine the appropriateness of HSCT in children and adolescents with nonremission ALL.","['Okamoto, Yasuhiro', 'Nakazawa, Yozo', 'Inoue, Masami', 'Watanabe, Kenichiro', 'Goto, Hiroaki', 'Yoshida, Nao', 'Noguchi, Maiko', 'Kikuta, Atsushi', 'Kato, Koji', 'Hashii, Yoshiko', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Kato, Motohiro']","['Okamoto Y', 'Nakazawa Y', 'Inoue M', 'Watanabe K', 'Goto H', 'Yoshida N', 'Noguchi M', 'Kikuta A', 'Kato K', 'Hashii Y', 'Atsuta Y', 'Kato M']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4412-6441', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0793-815X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3783-2121']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Osaka Women's and Children's Hospital, Osaka, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shizuoka Children's Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan."", ""Division of Hemato-Oncology/Regenerative Medicine, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan."", 'Pediatrics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200922,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*pediatrics', '*survival']",2020/09/23 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2020/09/22 12:14'],"['2020/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/22 12:14 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28732 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Dec;67(12):e28732. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28732.

We aimed to assess the representation of women in clinical trials leading to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cancer drug approvals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Trials supporting FDA cancer drug approvals between July 2008 and June 2018 were sourced from PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov. The ratio of female to male trial enrollment was compared with cancer incidence and mortality in the U.S. using International Agency for Research on Cancer data. Reproductive tract and breast cancers were excluded. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing trial enrollment with population incidence and mortality were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 186 trials leading to 170 FDA cancer drug approvals showed slight female underrepresentation compared with overall cancer incidence in the U.S. (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98, p < .0001). Female enrollment for drugs approved between 2008-2013 and 2014-2018 was unchanged (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.99-1.05, p = .25). There was slight female underrepresentation in hematological trials (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.998; p = .040 for leukemia; OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.90-0.997; p = .040 for lymphoma) and significant female underrepresentation in colorectal (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.69-0.76; p < .0001), pancreas (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93; p = .0004), lung (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.75-0.80; p < .0001), kidney (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.60-0.67; p < .0001), and thyroid cancer trials (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.23-0.28; p < .0001) compared with U.S. incidence. CONCLUSION: Female underrepresentation has persisted within solid organ tumor trials but is less notable in hematologic trials. Additional work is required to identify drivers of such disparity. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Adequate gender representation in clinical trials is a matter of health equity. This study demonstrates that women remain underrepresented in trials across hematological and solid organ trials compared with cancer incidence and mortality in women, with the disparity worse in a number of solid organ tumor types. There are thus still significant improvements to be made regarding adequate representation of women in trials. Studies exploring the reasons for ongoing disparity in gender representation are warranted to help clinicians to rectify this.","['Mendis, Shehara', 'Anand, Seerat', 'Karasinska, Joanna M', 'Dasari, Arvind', 'Unger, Joseph M', 'Gothwal, Anirudh', 'Ellis, Lee M', 'Varadhachary, Gauri', 'Kopetz, Scott', 'Overman, Michael J', 'Raghav, Kanwal', 'Loree, Jonathan M']","['Mendis S', 'Anand S', 'Karasinska JM', 'Dasari A', 'Unger JM', 'Gothwal A', 'Ellis LM', 'Varadhachary G', 'Kopetz S', 'Overman MJ', 'Raghav K', 'Loree JM']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9175-6329'],"['Medical Oncology, BC Cancer, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Pancreas Centre BC, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Baylor University, Waco, Texas, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Medical Oncology, BC Cancer, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201007,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,['0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)'],IM,"['*Breast Neoplasms', 'Drug Approval', 'Female', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Pharmaceutical Preparations']",PMC7873318,['NOTNLM'],"['*Clinical trial', '*Healthcare disparities', '*Neoplasms', '*Sex']",2020/09/23 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/09/22 12:14'],"['2020/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/22 12:14 [entrez]']",['10.1002/onco.13534 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2021 Feb;26(2):107-114. doi: 10.1002/onco.13534.

However, the role of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) in adult patients achieving complete molecular remission (CMR) is an alternative, less toxic treatment options, especially for the patients who lack suitable donors and are unfit for allo-HSCT. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of allo-HSCT and auto-HSCT for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ ALL. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library for studies published before June 2019 without language restriction. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for relapse rate (RR) and treatment-related mortality (TRM). Four prospective studies and one retrospective study were included with a total of 810 patients. We found auto-HSCT was superior to allo-HSCT in OS (HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.06-1.91, P = 0.02), and there was no difference between allo-HSCT and auto-HSCT for RFS (HR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.86-1.40, P = 0.44) and RR (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.22-1.26, P = 0.15). The risk of TRM for patients undergoing allo-HSCT was significantly higher than that of the patients who received auto-HSCT (OR = 5.06, 95% CI: 1.03-24.75, P = 0.05). Our meta-analysis shows that auto-HSCT may be an attractive and alternative treatment option for adult Ph+ ALL patients achieving CMR, with similar or better outcomes than allo-HSCT in the era of TKIs.","['Wei, Haichen', 'Kuang, Pu', 'Liu, Ting']","['Wei H', 'Kuang P', 'Liu T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1816-5551'],"['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, #37 Guo Xue Xiang Street, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, #37 Guo Xue Xiang Street, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, #37 Guo Xue Xiang Street, Chengdu, 610041, Sichuan, China. liuting@scu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20200922,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adult', 'Allografts', 'Autografts', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Survival Rate']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Meta-analysis', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors', 'positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2020/09/23 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/09/22 12:12'],"['2020/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/22 12:12 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04258-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04258-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Nov;99(11):2619-2628. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04258-1.

Recent studies carried out in the last three decades support the existence of stem cells also in tumors, the so-called cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells have the property of initiating and maintaining tumor growth, are able to self-renew and to differentiate, are the main drivers of intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity and the main cellular mediators of drug resistance, leading to tumor recurrence and metastasis. Cancer stem cells can be identified in many tumors according to specific immunophenotypic features, but cancer stemness cannot be defined as a fixed property, due to cancer plasticity. For these properties, cancer stem cells represent attractive targets for developing new anti-cancer therapies and there is supporting evidence that the combination of conventional anticancer therapies with drugs targeting cancer stem cells could lead to cancer eradication. Ongoing studies in some tumors strongly support the clinical utility of developing efficient strategies of cancer stem cell targeting.","['Testa, Ugo', 'Pelosi, Elvira', 'Castelli, Germana']","['Testa U', 'Pelosi E', 'Castelli G']",,"['Dipartimento di Oncologia, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Oncologia, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Oncologia, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Italy,Ann Ist Super Sanita,Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,7502520,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Preleukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,,2020/09/23 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2020/09/22 08:40'],"['2020/09/22 08:40 [entrez]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4415/ANN_20_03_12 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Ist Super Sanita. 2020 Jul-Sep;56(3):336-350. doi: 10.4415/ANN_20_03_12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ACPA and HTLV-1 were measured in 3887 subjects without a history of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between ACPA positivity and candidates of correlation with ACPA, i.e. the cigarette-smoking status quantified by Brinkman's index (BI) and HTLV-1 positivity.Results: Fifty-one subjects (1.3%) showed ACPA positivity, and 650 subjects (16.6%) were HTLV-1 carriers. In an age- and gender-adjusted logistic regression analysis, the BI [odds ratio (OR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI)1.02-1.14, p = 0.0031] and a BI value > 500 (OR 3.92, 95% CI 1.72-9.22, p = 0.0014) were each significantly associated with ACPA positivity.

Hematologic malignancies are among the top five cancers prevalent in SA, including lymphoma and leukemia. Most common malignancies in SA also include breast, thyroid, and colorectal cancer. We sought to evaluate the current trends of these most common cancers in SA. METHODS: Electronic search analysis pertaining to Hodgkin's lymphoma, leukemia, breast, colorectal, and thyroid cancer were carried out from two databases: The Saudi Cancer Registry (SCR) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER). Data on prevalence and incident frequency were collected. Trends from 2001 to 2014 were calculated and compared between SCR and SEER. FINDINGS: Leukemia is the most common cancer type among males in SA, followed by colorectal cancer. Hodgkin's lymphoma has become the third most common malignancy among Saudi males. Percentage of women's breast cancer and thyroid cancer among total cancer cases have increased by 10.5% and 1.7% respectively from 2001 to 2014, making them the first and second most common cancers in women respectively. Trends of thyroid cancer among males has been stable. Colorectal cancer stands as third most common among Saudi females. INTERPRETATIONS: There have been significant changes in trends of incidence rate of the most common cancers in SA among both males and females over the past decade. Breast cancer rates have risen at an alarming pace.

In this retrospective study, we collected 110 consecutive adult patients (18 years and older) with orbital lesions (excluding lacrimal gland lesions) that were diagnosed histopathologically in two tertiary eye centers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (January 2000 to July 2017). Patients with thyroid-related orbitopathy, infectious, and inflammatory/pseudo-inflammatory lesions were excluded. We had 60 males (54.5%) and 50 females (45.5%). The mean age at presentation was 51.4 years (range 19-99). Proptosis was the most common clinical presentation (mean duration 15.4 months). The orbital lesions in order of increasing prevalence were: lymphoproliferative lesions in 26.4%; vascular in 21.8%; secondary tumors in 14.6%; neurogenic in 13.6%; structural in 10.0%; soft tissue tumors 8.2%; then metastatic tumors (2.7%) and others (extramedullary leukemia, fibrous dysplasia, and histiocytic lesion: Rosai-Dorfman disease): one case each. Gender distribution was varied in lymphoproliferative disorders compared to vascular lesions. Cavernous hemangioma was the most common vascular lesion (83.3%) and schwannoma was the most common neurogenic tumor (60%). Secondary lesions extended to the orbit mostly from eyelids in nine out of 16 or conjunctiva in four out of 16 cases. A favorable outcome was observed in about 80% of patients who underwent excisional biopsy. The rest encountered local recurrence of the tumors, growing of residual lesions, and recurrence with further invasion to nearby structures. We concluded having a similar demographic pattern of orbital lesions in adults as has been universally reported. We have fewer secondary tumors. We have summarized the pathological profile of adult orbital lesions according to patients' age, gender, symptoms, and location of the lesion as a baseline guide for proper diagnosis of any orbital mass prior to surgical management planning and for future prognostic studies.","['Alsalamah, Abrar K', 'Maktabi, Azza My', 'Alkatan, Hind M']","['Alsalamah AK', 'Maktabi AM', 'Alkatan HM']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9968-4099'],"['Vitreoretinal and Uveitis Divisions, King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Department, King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Ophthalmology Department, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Pathology Department, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200729,Switzerland,J Epidemiol Glob Health,Journal of epidemiology and global health,101592084,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Orbital Diseases/epidemiology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC7758843,['NOTNLM'],"['*Orbit', '*demographics', '*histopathology', '*metastatic', '*secondary', '*space-occupying lesion', '*tumors']",2020/09/23 06:00,2021/08/24 06:00,['2020/09/22 05:48'],"['2020/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/22 05:48 [entrez]']","['jegh.k.200720.001 [pii]', '10.2991/jegh.k.200720.001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Epidemiol Glob Health. 2020 Dec;10(4):359-366. doi: 10.2991/jegh.k.200720.001.

In rare cases of MM, lymphoid malignancies may be detected incidentally during sentinel lymph node biopsies. In this case, we found a unique collision of MM and CLL infiltration in the skin. An 88-year-old male patient presented with a mass on the nasal root. Histopathological examination of the skin biopsy specimen revealed a deeply infiltrative, atypical spindle cell proliferation in the background of a collagenous stroma. Accompanying this lesion, there were foci of monotonous lymphoid cell populations involving skin appendages. In the immunohistochemical studies, the spindle cells were diffusely positive for S100, and focally positive for Melan-A and HMB45; the lymphoid cells were positive for CD20, CD5, and Bcl-2 and negative for CD3, Bcl-6, CD10, and Cyclin D1. Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with diagnoses of spindle cell melanoma and CLL. Interestingly, these two tumors together in their same morphological appearance were confirmed in a subsequent liver biopsy. Active skin surveillance of patients with CLL may be important to detect MM at an early stage that correlates with a better prognosis.","['Dirilenoglu, Fikret', 'Yukselen, Ozen Ozden', 'Mocan, Gamze']","['Dirilenoglu F', 'Yukselen OO', 'Mocan G']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2021-6186'],"['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Near East University, Nicosia, Cyprus.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kyrenia, Kyrenia, Cyprus.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Near East University, Nicosia, Cyprus.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201002,United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (MART-1 Antigen)', '0 (Melanoma-Specific Antigens)', '0 (PMEL protein, human)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (gp100 Melanoma Antigen)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Liver/pathology/ultrastructure', 'MART-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Male', 'Melanoma/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Melanoma-Specific Antigens/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*diagnosis/drug therapy/metabolism', 'S100 Proteins/metabolism', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Temozolomide/therapeutic use', 'gp100 Melanoma Antigen']",,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'collision tumor', 'liver', 'skin', 'spindle cell melanoma']",2020/09/23 06:00,2021/08/25 06:00,['2020/09/22 05:45'],"['2020/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/22 05:45 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cup.13878 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2020 Dec;47(12):1215-1219. doi: 10.1111/cup.13878.

NF-kappaB and AP-1 are crucial for ATLL, and both are transported to the nucleus by an importin (IPO)alpha/beta heterodimeric complex to activate target genes. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the function of IPObeta1 in ATLL. The expression of IPObeta1 was analyzed by western blotting and RT-PCR. Cell growth, viability, cell cycle, apoptosis and intracellular signaling cascades were examined by the water-soluble tetrazolium-8 assay, flow cytometry and western blotting. Xenograft tumors in severe combined immune deficient mice were used to evaluate the growth of ATLL cells in vivo. IPObeta1 was upregulated in HTLV-1-infected T cell lines. Further, IPObeta1 knockdown or the IPObeta1 inhibitor importazole and the IPOalpha/beta1 inhibitor ivermectin reduced HTLV-1-infected T cell proliferation. However, the effect of inhibitors on uninfected T cells was less pronounced. Further, in HTLV-1-infected T cell lines, inhibitors suppressed NF-kappaB and AP-1 nuclear transport and DNA binding, induced apoptosis and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and activated caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9. Inhibitors also mediated G1 cell cycle arrest. Moreover, the expression of NF-kappaB- and AP-1-target proteins involved in cell cycle and apoptosis was reduced. In vivo, the IPOalpha/beta1 inhibitor ivermectin decreased ATLL tumor burden without side effects. IPObeta1 mediated NF-kappaB and AP-1 translocation into ATLL cell nuclei, thereby regulating cell growth and survival, which provides new insights for targeted ATLL therapies. Thus, ivermectin, an anti-strongyloidiasis medication, could be a potent anti-ATLL agent.","['Ishikawa, Chie', 'Senba, Masachika', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Ishikawa C', 'Senba M', 'Mori N']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3998-6711'],"['Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan.', 'Division of Health Sciences, Transdisciplinary Research Organization for Subtropics and Island Studies, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan. naokimori50@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200921,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AP-1', '*Adult T cell leukemia', '*Human T cell leukemia virus type 1', '*Importin', '*NF-kappaB']",2020/09/23 06:00,2020/09/23 06:00,['2020/09/22 05:43'],"['2020/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/22 05:43 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10637-020-01007-z [doi]', '10.1007/s10637-020-01007-z [pii]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2021 Apr;39(2):317-329. doi: 10.1007/s10637-020-01007-z.

Although the study concluded that BTZ did not improve outcome overall, we examined patient subgroups benefiting from BTZ-containing chemotherapy using proteomic analyses. The proteasome inhibitor BTZ disrupts protein homeostasis and activates cytoprotective heat shock responses. Total heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and phosphorylated HSF1 (HSF1-pSer326) were measured in leukemic cells from 483 pediatric patients using reverse phase protein arrays. HSF1-pSer326 phosphorylation was significantly lower in pediatric AML compared with CD34+ nonmalignant cells. We identified a strong correlation between HSF1-pSer326 expression and BTZ sensitivity. BTZ significantly improved outcome of patients with low-HSF1-pSer326 with a 5-year event-free survival of 44% (ADE) vs 67% for low-HSF1-pSer326 treated with ADEB (P = .019). To determine the effect of HSF1 expression on BTZ potency in vitro, cell viability with HSF1 gene variants that mimicked phosphorylated (S326A) and nonphosphorylated (S326E) HSF1-pSer326 were examined. Those with increased HSF1 phosphorylation showed clear resistance to BTZ vs those with wild-type or reduced HSF1-phosphorylation.

In this study, we designed a novel putative anti-inflammatory peptide derived from tIK protein based on homology modeling of the human interleukin-10 (hIL-10) structure, and investigated whether the peptide exerted inhibitory effects against proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). The peptide contains key residues involved in binding hIL-10 to the IL-10 receptor, and exerted strong inhibitory effects on IL- 17 (43.8%) and TNF-alpha (50.7%). In addition, we used circular dichroism spectroscopy to confirm that the peptide is usually present in a random coil configuration in aqueous solution. In terms of toxicity, the peptide was found to be biologically safe. The mechanisms by which the short peptide derived from human tIK protein exerts inhibitory effects against IL-17 and TNF-alpha should be explored further.

Lenalidomide, an oral immunomodulatory agent with demonstrated clinical activity in CLL, can potentially restore immune system dysfunction associated with CLL while improving disease outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Phase II study randomized 49 patients with genetically high-risk CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma [SLL; defined as unmutated Ig heavy chain variable region, deletion(17p) or (11q), and/or complex abnormal karyotype], to receive lenalidomide either concurrent (arm A) or sequential to (arm B) two doses of 13-valent protein-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) administered 2 months apart, in patients not meeting International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia treatment criteria. RESULTS: Four serotypes (3, 4, 5, 6B) achieved the additional seroprotection definition of a fourfold increase in arm A, and six serotypes (3, 4, 5, 6B, 19A, 19F) in arm B. All patients achieved the defined concentration of 0.35 mug/mL for at least one serotype tested. No significant difference was observed with the addition of lenalidomide. At median time on treatment of 3.6 years, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.8 years [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.1-not reached]. PFS at 1, 2, and 3 years was 85% (95% CI, 72-93), 79% (95% CI, 64-88), and 72% (95% CI, 57-83), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lenalidomide is efficacious with manageable toxicities as an early intervention strategy in patients with high-risk CLL, but did not enhance humoral response to PCV13 vaccine.","['Thangavadivel, Shanmugapriya', 'Zhao, Qiuhong', 'Epperla, Narendranath', 'Rike, Lindsey', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Badawi, Mohamed', 'Bystry, Darlene M', 'Phelps, Mitch A', 'Andritsos, Leslie A', 'Rogers, Kerry A', 'Jones, Jeffrey', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Byrd, John C', 'Awan, Farrukh T']","['Thangavadivel S', 'Zhao Q', 'Epperla N', 'Rike L', 'Mo X', 'Badawi M', 'Bystry DM', 'Phelps MA', 'Andritsos LA', 'Rogers KA', 'Jones J', 'Woyach JA', 'Byrd JC', 'Awan FT']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9542-9050', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1615-5280', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5748-7874', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1813-9812']","['Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio. farrukh.awan@utsouthwestern.edu john.byrd@osumc.edu.', 'Harold C.

We aimed at identifying germline variants associated with survival in patients with mCRC treated with these regimens in Cancer and Leukemia Group B/SWOG 80405. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with mCRC receiving either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI were randomized to either cetuximab or bevacizumab. DNA from peripheral blood was genotyped for approximately 700,000 SNPs. The association between SNPs and overall survival (OS) was tested in 613 patients of genetically estimated European ancestry using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: The four most significant SNPs associated with OS were three haplotypic SNPs between microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 (MGST1) and LIM domain only 3 (LMO3, representative HR, 1.56; P = 1.30 x 10(-6)), and rs11644916 in AXIN1 (HR, 1.39, P = 4.26 x 10(-6)). AXIN1 is a well-established tumor suppressor gene in colorectal cancer, and rs11644916 (G>A) conferred shorter OS. Median OS for patients with the AA, AG, or GG genotypes was 18.4, 25.6, or 36.4 months, respectively. In 90 patients with stage IV colorectal cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), rs11649255 in AXIN1 [in almost complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs11644916], was associated with shorter OS (HR, 2.24, P = 0.0096). Using rs11648673 in AXIN1 (in very high LD with rs11644916 and with functional evidence), luciferase activity in three colorectal cancer cell lines was reduced. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large genome-wide association study ever conducted in patients with mCRC treated with first-line standard treatment in a randomized phase III trial. A common SNP in AXIN1 conferred worse OS and the effect was replicated in TCGA. Further studies in colorectal cancer experimental models are required.","['Innocenti, Federico', 'Sibley, Alexander B', 'Patil, Sushant A', 'Etheridge, Amy S', 'Jiang, Chen', 'Ou, Fang-Shu', 'Howell,

Nevertheless, patients receiving TKIs report chronic adverse events such as fatigue, edema, and muscle cramps, which lead to a decrease in their quality of life (QoL). Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the QoL and symptom burden in patients receiving original imatinib, generic imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 121 patients with CML who received TKIs for at least 3 months were enrolled in the study. The QoL was assessed with the Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life Questionnaire-Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (QLQ-CML24) modules. The symptom burden was assessed with MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (MDASI-CML) and EORTC QLQ-CML24. RESULTS: The median age of the study population was 53 years (range, 28-90 years), and 83 (81.4%) patients had a low-to-medium Sokal risk score. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of most patients were good (< 2; 96%), and comorbidity scores were low (HCT-CI < 3; 90.8%). There was no significant difference between the general health status of patients in terms of EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CML24. According to the results of the MDASI-CML and QLQ-CML24 modules, the most common symptom was fatigue (58.7%) in all groups, and there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the effects on the daily life activities of the patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with CML receiving first- and second-generation TKIs were seen to have a similar QoL and symptom burden.","['Bostan, Hayri', 'Toptas, Tayfur', 'Tanrikulu, Funda Pepedil', 'Kut, Kevser', 'Arikan, Fatma', 'Yilmaz, Fergun', 'Atagunduz, Isik', 'Firatli-Tuglular, Tulin']","['Bostan H', 'Toptas T', 'Tanrikulu FP', 'Kut K', 'Arikan F', 'Yilmaz F', 'Atagunduz I', 'Firatli-Tuglular T']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Marmara University Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey; Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Health Sciences, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.

METHODS: Data on the 430 children with cancer during 2002-2015 were collected from the Pudong Cancer Registry, diagnosed with the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology and categorized according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer. The incidence rate, trends over time, and survival of patients grouped by sex, age, and region were explored using the Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and Joinpoint Regression models. RESULTS: The crude childhood cancer incidence and world age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) were 115.1/1,000,000 and 116.3/1,000,000 person-years. The two most frequent cancers were leukemia (136/430, 31.63%, ASR, 37.8/1,000,000 person-years) and central nervous system (CNS) tumors (86/430, 20.00%, ASR, 22.9/1,000,000 person-years). Our findings indicate that the survival rate for children between 10 and 15 years of age was higher than that for 5-10; and the survival rate for children who had leukemia was higher than that of children with CNS tumors. However, the overall incidence of childhood cancer, and leukemia, CNS tumors remained relatively stable in Pudong between 2002 and 2015. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and survival rate for childhood cancer patients varied by age and cancer type. The overall trends of childhood cancer incidence remained relatively stable in Pudong from 2002 to 2015 even though socioeconomic development has been unprecedentedly fast in this region.","['Ji, Junqi', 'Luo, Zheng', 'Chen, Yichen', 'Xu, Xiaoyun', 'Li, Xiaopan', 'Liu, Shijian', 'Tong, Shilu']","['Ji J', 'Luo Z', 'Chen Y', 'Xu X', 'Li X', 'Liu S', 'Tong S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7050-463X'],"[""Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Children Health Advocacy Institute, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 1678 Dongfang Road, Shanghai, 200127, China."", 'Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences Affiliated Zhoupu Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Pudong New Area Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Fudan University Pudong Institute of Preventive Medicine, Pudong New Area, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences Affiliated Zhoupu Hospital, Shanghai, China. xxy195211@163.com.', 'Pudong New Area Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Fudan University Pudong Institute of Preventive Medicine, Pudong New Area, Shanghai, China. xiaopanli0224@126.com.', ""Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Children Health Advocacy Institute, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 1678 Dongfang Road, Shanghai, 200127, China. liushijian@scmc.com.cn."", 'School of Public Health, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. liushijian@scmc.com.cn.', ""Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Children Health Advocacy Institute, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 1678 Dongfang Road, Shanghai, 200127, China."", 'School of Public Health, Institute of Environment and Population Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Public Health and Social Work, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200921,England,BMC Public Health,BMC public health,100968562,,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'China/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', '*Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate']",PMC7507240,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood cancer', 'Incidence rate', 'Population-based cancer registry', 'Survival rate', 'Time trends']",2020/09/23 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/22 05:31'],"['2019/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/22 05:31 [entrez]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12889-020-09493-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12889-020-09493-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Public Health. 2020 Sep 21;20(1):1430. doi: 10.1186/s12889-020-09493-9.,,"['PKJ2017-Y01]/Science and Technology Development Program of Pudong Shanghai New', 'District', '18DZ2294100/Shanghai Professional and Technical Services Platform', '81872637/National Science Foundation of China', '201840324/Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: No differences in methylation were found between adjacent and healthy tissues, but clear differences were found between adjacent and tumor samples. We identified hypermethylated CpG islands located in promoter regions that drive differential gene expression of transcription factors and their target genes. Conclusion: Changes in methylation of a few genes provoke important changes in gene expression, by expanding the signal through transcription activation/repression.","['Diez-Villanueva, Anna',

Therefore, this technology might be implemented soon to detect well-known biomarkers in cancers and other diseases. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive heterogeneous malignancy that requires intensive treatment to cure the patient. Leukemia relapse is still a major challenge even for patients who have favorable genetic abnormalities. MS-based proteomics could be of great help to both describe the proteome changes of individual patients and identify biomarkers that might encourage specific treatments or clinical strategies. Herein, we will review the advances and availability of the MS-based proteomics strategies that could already be used in clinical proteomics. However, the heterogeneity of complex diseases as AML requires consensus to recognize AML biomarkers and to establish MS-based workflows that allow their unbiased identification and quantification. Although our literature review appears promising towards the utilization of MS-based proteomics in clinical AML in a near future, major efforts are required to validate AML biomarkers and agree on clinically approved workflows.","['Hernandez-Valladares, Maria', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Selheim, Frode']","['Hernandez-Valladares M', 'Bruserud O', 'Selheim F']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9347-7841'],"['Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Facility of the University of Bergen (PROBE), Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Facility of the University of Bergen (PROBE), Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Department of Biomedicine, University of Bergen, 5009 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200917,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Computational Biology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism/therapy', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Proteome/*analysis/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Robotics/instrumentation/methods', 'Workflow']",PMC7556012,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker', 'clinical proteomics', 'diagnosis', 'laboratory robots', 'prognosis', 'treatment']",2020/09/23 06:00,2021/03/16 06:00,['2020/09/22 01:03'],"['2020/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/22 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21186830 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21186830 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Sep 17;21(18). pii: ijms21186830. doi: 10.3390/ijms21186830.,,['100933/Kreftforeningen'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are nanometric vehicles and used for delivering drugs, as they are biocompatible and minimally immunogenic. Exosomal secretions derived from cancer cells contribute to metastasis, immortality, angiogenesis, tissue invasion, stemness and chemo/radio-resistance. Exosome-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lnc RNAs) are involved in the pathophysiology of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, exosomes derived from mesenchymal stromal cells, astrocytes, macrophages, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are involved in the cancer progression and stemness as they induce chemotherapeutic drug resistance in several cancer cells. This review covered the recent research advances in understanding the role of exosomes in cancer progression, metastasis, angiogenesis, stemness and drug resistance by illustrating the modulatory effects of exosomal cargo (ex. miRNA, lncRNAs, etc.) on cell signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and cancer stem cell growth and development. Recent reports have implicated exosomes even in the treatment of several cancers. For instance, exosomes-loaded with novel anti-cancer drugs such as phytochemicals, tumor-targeting proteins, anticancer peptides, nucleic acids are known to interfere with drug resistance pathways in several cancer cell lines. In addition, this review depicted the need to develop exosome-based novel diagnostic biomarkers for early detection of cancers and neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, the role of exosomes in stroke and oxidative stress-mediated neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) is also discussed in this article.","['Beeraka, Narasimha M', 'Doreswamy, Shalini H', 'Sadhu, Surya P', 'Srinivasan, Asha', 'Pragada, Rajeswara Rao', 'Madhunapantula, SubbaRao V', 'Aliev, Gjumrakch']","['Beeraka NM', 'Doreswamy SH', 'Sadhu SP', 'Srinivasan A', 'Pragada RR', 'Madhunapantula SV', 'Aliev G']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7373-3182'],"['Center of Excellence in Regenerative Medicine and Molecular Biology (CERM), Department of Biochemistry, JSS Medical College, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research (JSS AHER), Mysuru 570015, Karnataka, India.', 'Center of Excellence in Regenerative Medicine and Molecular Biology (CERM), Department of Biochemistry, JSS Medical College, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research (JSS AHER), Mysuru 570015, Karnataka, India.', 'AU College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Andhra University, Visakhapatnam 530003, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Center of Excellence in Regenerative Medicine and Molecular Biology (CERM), Division of Nanoscience and Technology, Faculty of Life Sciences, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research (JSS AHER), Mysuru 570015, Karnataka, India.', 'AU College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Andhra University, Visakhapatnam 530003, Andhra Pradesh, India.', 'Center of Excellence in Molecular Biology and Regenerative Medicine (CEMR), Department of Biochemistry, JSS Medical College, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research (JSS AHER), Mysuru 570015, Karnataka, India.', 'Special Interest Group in Cancer Biology and Cancer Stem Cells (SIG-CBCSC), JSS Medical College, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research (JSS AHER), Mysuru 570015, Karnataka, India.', 'Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (Sechenov University), St. Trubetskaya, 8, bld. 2, 119991 Moscow, Russia.', 'Institute of Physiologically Active Compounds, Russian Academy of Sciences, 142432 Chernogolovka, Moscow Region, Russia.', 'Research Institute of Human Morphology, 3 Tsyurupy Street, 117418 Moscow, Russia.', 'GALLY International Research Institute, 7733 Louis Pasteur Drive, #330, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200917,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Phytochemicals)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Exosomes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/genetics', 'Phytochemicals/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Untranslated/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC7555629,['NOTNLM'],"['angiogenesis', 'cancers', 'chemo-/radio-resistance', 'exosomes', 'lncRNAs', 'metastasis', 'miRNAs', 'neurodegeneration', 'phytochemicals', 'stemness']",2020/09/23 06:00,2021/03/16 06:00,['2020/09/22 01:02'],"['2020/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/22 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21186818 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21186818 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Sep 17;21(18). pii: ijms21186818. doi: 10.3390/ijms21186818.,,"['5-100/Sechenov University', 'Research Center Grant/GALLY International Research Institute']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consolidation chemotherapy is usually given to the pediatric ALL patients, however there is no meta-analysis and network analysis conducting the efficacy of the chemotherapy. Therefore, we perform a protocol to assess the efficacy of chemotherapeutics for pediatric ALL. METHODS: A literature search for randomized controlled trials about some specific chemotherapy regimens for pediatric ALL will be carried out in 7 electronic databases from their establishment to June 2019: the Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Sino Med, the Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP) and the Wanfang Database. Complete continuous remission will be measured as primary outcome. Stata 14.0 will be utilized to perform a standard pairwise meta-analysis and the NMA, as well as draw Network Plots of Network Meta. RESULTS: This network meta-analysis will evaluate the efficacy of different consolidation chemotherapy regimens. CONCLUSION: This study will furnish decision-making reference on optimum proposal of chemotherapy regimens for pediatric ALL.

This observation was corroborated by our RNA sequence analysis data in which VDR, CD14, and BAX expression were increased, and FLT-3, PIM1 and Bcl-2 expression were decreased. To address the hypercalcemia issue, we genetically engineered MOLM-14 cells to constantly express CYP27B1 (the VD3 activating enzyme, 1-alpha-hydroxylase-25(OH)D3) through lentiviral transduction procedures. Subsequently, we used these cells as vehicles to deliver the CYP27B1 enzyme to the bone marrow of AML mice. We observed that AML mice with CYP27B1 treatment had longer overall survival compared to no treatment and displayed no significant change in calcium level.","['Xu, Yi', 'Payne, Kimberly', 'Pham, Linh Hoang Gia', 'Eunwoo, Park', 'Xiao, Jeffrey', 'Chi, David', 'Lyu, Justin', 'Campion, Rosalia', 'Wasnik, Samiksha', 'Jeong, Il Seok', 'Tang, Xiaolei', 'Baylink, David Jeston', 'Chen, Chien Shing', 'Reeves, Mark', 'Akhtari, Mojtaba', 'Mirshahidi, Saied', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Cao, Huynh']","['Xu Y', 'Payne K', 'Pham LHG', 'Eunwoo P', 'Xiao J', 'Chi D', 'Lyu J', 'Campion R', 'Wasnik S', 'Jeong IS', 'Tang X', 'Baylink DJ', 'Chen CS', 'Reeves M', 'Akhtari M', 'Mirshahidi S', 'Marcucci G', 'Cao H']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Loma Linda University Cancer Center, Loma Linda, CA, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Regenerative Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Division of Anatomy, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Regenerative Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Regenerative Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Loma Linda University Cancer Center, Loma Linda, CA, USA; Department of Medicine, Division of Regenerative Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Regenerative Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Regenerative Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Loma Linda University Cancer Center, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Regenerative Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Loma Linda University Cancer Center, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Regenerative Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA; Department of Veterinary Biomedical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Long Island University, Brookville, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Regenerative Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Loma Linda University Cancer Center, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Loma Linda University Cancer Center, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Loma Linda University Cancer Center, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Loma Linda University Cancer Center Biospecimen Laboratory, Department of Medicine & Basic Sciences, Loma Linda, CA, USA.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Loma Linda University Cancer Center, Loma Linda, CA, USA.

Despite this, there is a paucity of data on the real-world health care resource utilization costs of AZA in this population. METHODS: We linked the Ontario AZA MDS registry-higher-risk MDS/low blast-count AML-to population-based health system administrative databases. Patients were observed for 24 months after first AZA and censored at the earliest of 90 days after last AZA, date of death, time of AML induction/stem-cell transplantation, or March 31, 2016. Costs (2015 Canadian dollars) were expressed as standardized mean and median 28-day costs. Univariable quantile regression was used to explore the association of baseline patient and disease characteristics and median cost. Multivariable quantile regression was used to explore predictors of median costs. RESULTS: Among 877 patients in the registry, mean standardized 28-day cost per patient was $17,638 (median, $15,272; interquartile range [IQR], $11,869-$19,580) and $13,450 (median, $11,043; IQR, $7,981-$14,882) excluding the cost of AZA. Major nondrug drivers of cost were cancer clinic visits and inpatient care (mean standardized 28-day cost, $4,631; median, $1,558; IQR, $238-$4,961). Transfusion dependence at AZA initiation (P = .001) and greater comorbid disease burden (P = .009) were independently associated with increased cost. CONCLUSION: Our cohort of patients with uniformly higher-risk MDS/low blast-count AML treated with AZA demonstrates substantial costs of care above and beyond the cost of AZA alone. These results provide insight into the costs of AZA in the real world with implications for resource allocation.","['Mozessohn, Lee', 'Cheung, Matthew C', 'Mittmann, Nicole', 'Earle, Craig C', 'Liu, Ning', 'Buckstein, Rena']","['Mozessohn L', 'Cheung MC', 'Mittmann N', 'Earle CC', 'Liu N', 'Buckstein R']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3436-3849'],"['Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Sunnybrook Research Institute, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, and Institute for Health, Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200921,United States,JCO Oncol Pract,JCO oncology practice,101758685,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy', 'Ontario']",,,,2020/09/22 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2020/09/21 17:12'],"['2020/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/21 17:12 [entrez]']",['10.1200/OP.20.00446 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Oncol Pract. 2021 Apr;17(4):e517-e525. doi: 10.1200/OP.20.00446.

Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 genes are found collectively in about 20-25% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Mutant IDH enzymes have neomorphic activity and convert alphaKG to the oncometabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2-HG) which accumulates at high levels in the cell and hampers the function of alphaKG-dependent enzymes, including epigenetic regulators, thus leading to altered gene expression and block of differentiation and contributing to leukemia development. Inhibition of the neomorphic mutants induces marked decrease in R-2-HG levels and restores myeloid differentiation. Enasidenib and ivosidenib are potent and selective inhibitors of mutant IDH2 and IDH1, respectively, act as differentiating agents and showed clinical activity in relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML harboring the specific mutation.

However, outcomes remain unsatisfactory particularly for adult patients over 60 years old. Not surprisingly several cases of therapy-related AML (tAML) and secondary AML, both characterized by poorer prognosis, are more common in older population. For several decades initial therapy for AML remained unchanged and typically treatment consisted of an anthracycline combined with continuous infusion of cytarabine for 7 days, the so-called ""7+3"" standard regimen. The efforts made by the researchers to improve this standard schedule, have led to only modest improvement in the response rate (RR) but no change in overall survival (OS), until the recent evolution seen with new target specific mutation therapies. In 2017, a new liposomal-encapsulated formulation with daunorubicin and cytarabine (CPX-351) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of newly diagnosed tAML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRCs). Based on the findings that ratiometric delivery may be more effective than administration of either drug at their maximum tolerated dose (MTD), CPX-351 was designed to deliver a fixed 5:1 molar ratio of the two molecules historically used in the standard ""7+3"" regimen, cytarabine and daunorubicin respectively. CPX-351 did show improvements of overall survival compared to traditional ""7+3"" in newly diagnosed secondary and therapy-related AML in adult patients. However, questions remain regarding how to select across AML patient subgroups to maximize the clinical benefit. Possible future directions include evaluating CPX-351 dose intensification, combining this liposomal formulation with targeted therapies and not least important a better understanding about the mechanism of improved responses in tAML and AML-MRC, two entities recognized to be less chemo-sensitive than other hematologic malignancies. In summary, CPX-351 offers finally something new in the landscape of AML therapy. Herein we will review the rationale behind this new drug product development, the main pharmacological characteristics, and discuss the results of clinical trials that led to its FDA approval at first and by EMA in 2018.","['Cafaro, Alessandro', 'Giannini, Maria B', 'Silimbani, Paolo', 'Cangini, Delia', 'Masini, Carla', 'Ghelli Luserna Di Rora, Andrea', 'Simonetti, Giorgia', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Cerchione, Claudio']","['Cafaro A', 'Giannini MB', 'Silimbani P', 'Cangini D', 'Masini C', 'Ghelli Luserna Di Rora A', 'Simonetti G', 'Martinelli G', 'Cerchione C']",,"['Unit of Oncological Pharmacy, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.', 'Unit of Oncological Pharmacy, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.', 'Unit of Oncological Pharmacy, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Biosciences, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Biosciences, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.', 'IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy - claudio.cerchione@irst.emr.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200921,Italy,Minerva Med,Minerva medica,0400732,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CPX-351)', '0 (Liposomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Liposomes', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications']",,,,2020/09/22 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/09/21 16:11'],"['2020/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/21 16:11 [entrez]']","['S0026-4806.20.07017-2 [pii]', '10.23736/S0026-4806.20.07017-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Minerva Med. 2020 Oct;111(5):455-466. doi: 10.23736/S0026-4806.20.07017-2.

In this view, is it well established that measurement of leukemic cells surviving chemotherapy (called measurable residual disease, MRD) during the course of treatment may be a reliable biomarker in predicting relapse. Detection of MRD relies on highly sensitive techniques, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction and multiparametric flow cytometry, which, due to their levels of specificity and sensitivity, are increasingly included in the decision-making process of AML treatment.

Additionally, growing research indicates that FLT3 status evolves through a disease continuum (clonal evolution), where AML cases can acquire FLT3 mutations at relapse - not present in the moment of diagnosis. Several FLT3 inhibitors have been tested in patients with FLT3-mutated AML. These drugs exhibit different kinase inhibitory profiles, pharmacokinetics and adverse events. First-generation multi-kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, midostaurin, lestaurtinib) are characterized by a broad-spectrum of drug targets, whereas second-generation inhibitors (quizartinib, crenolanib, gilteritinib) show more potent and specific FLT3 inhibition, and are thereby accompanied by less toxic effects. Notwithstanding, all FLT3 inhibitors face primary and acquired mechanisms of resistance, and therefore the combinations with other drugs (standard chemotherapy, hypomethylating agents, checkpoint inhibitors) and its application in different clinical settings (upfront therapy, maintenance, relapsed or refractory disease) are under study in a myriad of clinical trials. This review focuses on the role of FLT3 mutations in AML, pharmacological features of FLT3 inhibitors, known mechanisms of drug resistance and accumulated evidence for the use of FLT3 inhibitors in different clinical settings.","['Mosquera Orgueira, Adrian', 'Bao Perez, Laura', 'Mosquera Torre, Alicia', 'Peleteiro Raindo, Andres', 'Cid Lopez, Miguel', 'Diaz Arias, Jose A', 'Ferreiro Ferro, Roi', 'Antelo Rodriguez, Beatriz', 'Gonzalez Perez, Marta S', 'Albors Ferreiro, Manuel', 'Alonso Vence, Natalia', 'Perez Encinas, Manuel M', 'Bello Lopez, Jose L', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Cerchione, Claudio']","['Mosquera Orgueira A', 'Bao Perez L', 'Mosquera Torre A', 'Peleteiro Raindo A', 'Cid Lopez M', 'Diaz Arias JA', 'Ferreiro Ferro R', 'Antelo Rodriguez B', 'Gonzalez Perez MS', 'Albors Ferreiro M', 'Alonso Vence N', 'Perez Encinas MM', 'Bello Lopez JL', 'Martinelli G', 'Cerchione C']",,"['Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), Santiago de Compostela, Spain -

In a case-control study, we compared the neuropsychological profile and functional characteristics in two case HTLV-1-infected groups (asymptomatic and with HAM/TSP) with a control group negative for HTLV-1. Subjects were paired for age, sex, and educational features. The case group differed from control group in neuropsychological measures such as in episodic memory recall, executive functions, and fine motor dexterity measure. Individuals with HAM/TSP have more depressive symptoms and worst performance in activities of daily living (ADL) presenting a less functionality. In multivariate models, the fine motor performance, the executive functioning, the recognition memory, and the depressive symptoms explained part of the variance in functionality. Those findings may contribute to understand of everyday life impairments and limitations of HTLV-1-infected population and to organize the rehabilitation. Once more, based in neuropsychological and functional data, we can reaffirm that HTLV-1 is never a benign condition, but sometimes it is only in a stage coursing with less symptoms.","['de Paula, Jonas Jardim', 'Romanelli, Luiz Claudio', 'de Faria, Renata Caetano Vieira', 'Proietti, Anna Barbara', 'Malloy-Diniz, Leandro Fernandes', 'Romano-Silva, Marco Aurelio', 'de Miranda, Debora Marques', 'Nicolato, Rodrigo']","['de Paula JJ', 'Romanelli LC', 'de Faria RCV', 'Proietti AB', 'Malloy-Diniz LF', 'Romano-Silva MA', 'de Miranda DM', 'Nicolato R']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7081-8401'],"['Centro de Tecnologia em Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil. jonasjardim@gmail.com.', 'GIPH, Fundacao HEMOMINAS, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Centro de Tecnologia em Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'GIPH, Fundacao HEMOMINAS, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Centro de Tecnologia em Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Saude Mental, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Centro de Tecnologia em Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Saude Mental, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Centro de Tecnologia em Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Pediatria Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Centro de Tecnologia em Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Saude Mental, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200921,United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Activities of daily living', 'Depression', 'HAM/TSP', 'HTLV-1', 'Myelopathy', 'Neuropsychology']",2020/09/22 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2020/09/21 12:13'],"['2019/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/21 12:13 [entrez]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13365-020-00905-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s13365-020-00905-5 [pii]']",aheadofprint,J Neurovirol. 2020 Sep 21. pii: 10.1007/s13365-020-00905-5. doi: 10.1007/s13365-020-00905-5.,,['Pesquisa/Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monoclonal protein in the serum and/or urine is frequently detected. Over the past decade, important progress has been made in the comprehension of disease biology and treatment personalization. Much work has been put into the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene-modified T-cell therapy thought to be a promising therapeutic option for pluritreated patients with refractory MM. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed an analysis of clinical trials registered at the international repository clinicaltrials.gov using ""CAR"" OR ""CAR T"" AND ""multiple myeloma"" as search terms to understand what were the antigens targeted by CAR T strategies and what was the trade-off of their exploitation. The search retrieved a list of 103 trials that was manually filtered to eliminate follow-up and observational or not-pertinent trials. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Most studies employed anti-BCMA targeting either alone (62/94; 66%), or in combination with a second target (12/94; 13%). The second target most studied was SLAMF7 (CD319) explored by 4/94 (4%) clinical trials. Other antigens investigated and described here include: CD44v6, CD38, CD138, MUC1, CD56, CD19, Igk light chain, Lewis Y, CD229 and GPRC5D. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting an appropriate antigen(s) is the key to both safety and efficacy of CAR T approaches in MM as there is dearth of tumor-specific antigens. Most antigens tested are merely enriched on MM cells. Working with tumor-enriched antigens requires careful assessment of the balance between harm (toxicity) and benefit (disease eradication) to the patient. This review provides an up-to-date overview of the avenues that are being explored.","['Nicolini, Fabio', 'Bravaccini, Sara', 'Mazza, Massimiliano', 'Gruszka, Alicja M', 'Tazzari, Marcella', 'MartIn-Antonio, Beatriz', 'Juan, Manel', 'Ibrahim, Toni', 'Maltoni, Roberta', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Cerchione, Claudio']","['Nicolini F', 'Bravaccini S', 'Mazza M', 'Gruszka AM', 'Tazzari M', 'MartIn-Antonio B', 'Juan M', 'Ibrahim T', 'Maltoni R', 'Martinelli G', 'Cerchione C']",,"['Immunotherapy, Cell Therapy and Biobank (ITCB), IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.', 'Biosciences Laboratory, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.', 'Immunotherapy, Cell Therapy and Biobank (ITCB), IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy - massimiliano.mazza@irst.emr.it.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Immunotherapy, Cell Therapy and Biobank (ITCB), IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.', 'August Pi Biomedical Research Institute, Sunyer Hospital, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'August Pi Biomedical Research Institute, Sunyer Hospital, Clinic of Immunology, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Osteoncology and Rare Tumors Center, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.', 'IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.', 'IRCCS Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST), Meldola, Forli-Cesena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200921,Italy,Panminerva Med,Panminerva medica,0421110,"['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,,2020/09/22 06:00,2021/11/10 06:00,['2020/09/21 10:41'],"['2020/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/21 10:41 [entrez]']","['S0031-0808.20.04146-4 [pii]', '10.23736/S0031-0808.20.04146-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Panminerva Med. 2021 Mar;63(1):37-45. doi: 10.23736/S0031-0808.20.04146-4.

Neutrophils phagocytose the pathogen, but the mechanism of pathogen elimination is controversial. Macroautophagy/autophagy, a crucial mechanism for several neutrophil functions, can be modulated by immunological mediators. The costimulatory molecule SLAMF1 can act as a microbial sensor in macrophages being also able to interact with autophagy-related proteins. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that human neutrophils express SLAMF1 upon Mtb-stimulation. Furthermore, SLAMF1 was found colocalizing with LC3B(+) vesicles, and activation of SLAMF1 increased neutrophil autophagy induced by Mtb. Finally, tuberculosis patients' neutrophils displayed reduced levels of SLAMF1 and lower levels of autophagy against Mtb as compared to healthy controls. Altogether, these results indicate that SLAMF1 participates in neutrophil autophagy during active tuberculosis.Abbreviations: AFB: acid-fast bacilli; BafA1: bafilomycin A1; CLL: chronic lymphocytic leukemia; DPI: diphenyleneiodonium; EVs: extracellular vesicles; FBS: fetal bovine serum; HD: healthy donors; HR: high responder (tuberculosis patient); IFNG: interferon gamma; IL1B: interleukin 1 beta; IL17A: interleukin 17A; IL8: interleukin 8; LR: low responder (tuberculosis patient); mAb: monoclonal antibody; MAP1LC3/LC3: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPK1/ERK2: mitogen-activated protein kinase 1; MAPK14/p38: mitogen-activated protein kinase 14; Mtb: Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Mtb-Ag: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Strain H37Rv, whole cell lysate; NETs: neutrophils extracellular traps; PPD: purified protein derivative; ROS: reactive oxygen species; PIK3C3/VPS34: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3; SLAMF1: signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family member 1; TB: tuberculosis; TLR: toll like receptor.","['Pellegrini, Joaquin Miguel', 'Sabbione, Florencia', 'Morelli, Maria Paula', 'Tateosian, Nancy Liliana', 'Castello, Florencia Andrea', 'Amiano, Nicolas Oscar', 'Palmero, Domingo', 'Levi, Alberto', 'Ciallella, Lorena', 'Colombo, Maria Isabel', 'Trevani, Analia Silvina', 'Garcia, Veronica Edith']","['Pellegrini JM', 'Sabbione F', 'Morelli MP', 'Tateosian NL', 'Castello FA', 'Amiano NO', 'Palmero D', 'Levi A', 'Ciallella L', 'Colombo MI', 'Trevani AS', 'Garcia VE']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3505-8638', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7157-486X']","['Departamento de Quimica Biologica.

Prior to chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) infusion conditioning chemotherapy is used routinely to establish a favorable in vivo environment for CAR-T expansion, which has mostly involved fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. We report on a patient presented with extreme fatigue and anemia and was diagnosed with relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) harbored T315I-BCR-ABL mutation, who had undergone allogeneic HSCT and multiple reinducing chemotherapy, but achieved complete hematologic remission (CHR) with CAR -T infusion as a later salvage treatment. Prior to CAR-T infusion there was no conditioning chemotherapy, but a bone marrow suppression period induced by ponatinib. CAR-T cell infusion was well tolerated and the patient achieved a CHR and maintained it for three months. At present, there is no relevant report on the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as preconditioning protocols before CAR-T cells infusion. Our case indicated ponatinib not only reduces tumor burden but may also serve as a conditioning regimen for CAR-T therapy in the treatment of relapsed and refractory Ph-ALL.","['Dai, Xingbin', 'Tian, Fang', 'Xu, Zuqiong', 'Kong, Xiangtu', 'Jiang, Pengjun', 'Xia, Wen', 'Zhu, Xuejun']","['Dai X', 'Tian F', 'Xu Z', 'Kong X', 'Jiang P', 'Xia W', 'Zhu X']",,"['Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China; First School of Clinical Medicine, Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'First School of Clinical Medicine, Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China; Research Center of TCM, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China; First School of Clinical Medicine, Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China; First School of Clinical Medicine, Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China; First School of Clinical Medicine, Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China; First School of Clinical Medicine, Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China; First School of Clinical Medicine, Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.

The common MLL fusion partner AF9 (MLLT3) can directly bind to AF4, DOT1L, BCOR, and CBX8. To delineate the relevance of BCOR and CBX8 binding to MLL-AF9 for leukemogenesis, here we determine protein structures of AF9 complexes with CBX8 and BCOR, and show that binding of all four partners to AF9 is mutually exclusive. Using the structural analyses, we identify point mutations that selectively disrupt AF9 interactions with BCOR and CBX8. In bone marrow stem/progenitor cells expressing point mutant CBX8 or point mutant MLL-AF9, we show that disruption of direct CBX8/MLL-AF9 binding does not impact in vitro cell proliferation, whereas loss of direct BCOR/MLL-AF9 binding causes partial differentiation and increased proliferation. Strikingly, loss of MLL-AF9/BCOR binding abrogated its leukemogenic potential in a mouse model. The MLL-AF9 mutant deficient for BCOR binding reduces the expression of the EYA1 phosphatase and the protein level of c-Myc. Reduction in BCOR binding to MLL-AF9 alters a MYC-driven gene expression program, as well as altering expression of SIX-regulated genes, likely contributing to the observed reduction in the leukemia-initiating cell population.","['Schmidt, Charles R', 'Achille, Nicholas J', 'Kuntimaddi, Aravinda', 'Boulton, Adam M', 'Leach, Benjamin I', 'Zhang, Shubin', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J', 'Bushweller, John H']","['Schmidt CR', 'Achille NJ', 'Kuntimaddi A', 'Boulton AM', 'Leach BI', 'Zhang S', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ', 'Bushweller JH']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7379-314X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5386-1758']","['Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois. jhb4v@virginia.edu nzelezn@luc.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia. jhb4v@virginia.edu nzelezn@luc.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Cancer Discov,Blood cancer discovery,101764786,,,,PMC7497807,,,2020/09/22 06:00,2020/09/22 06:01,['2020/09/21 06:26'],"['2020/09/21 06:26 [entrez]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-20-0036 [doi]', '2643-3230.BCD-20-0036 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cancer Discov. 2020 Sep;1(2):162-177. doi: 10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-20-0036.,,"['P41 RR002301/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA233749/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR023035/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 GM103399/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155328/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest No potential conflicts of interest', 'were disclosed.']",['NIHMS1625497'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where a recurrent minimally deleted region including MIR15A/MIR16-1 has been mapped, the deletions in MM predominantly involve the entire chromosome and no specific driver gene has been identified. Additional candidate loci include RB1 and DIS3, but while biallelic deletion of RB1 is associated with disease progression, DIS3 is a common essential gene and complete inactivation is not observed. The Vk*MYC transgenic mouse model of MM spontaneously acquires del(14), syntenic to human chromosome 13, and Rb1 complete inactivation, but not Dis3 mutations. Taking advantage of this model, we explored the role in MM initiation and progression of two candidate loci on chromosome 13: RB1 and MIR15A/MIR16-1. Monoallelic deletion of Mir15a/Mir16-1 but not Rb1 was sufficient to accelerate the development of monoclonal gammopathy in wildtype mice, and the progression of MM in Vk*MYC mice, resulting in increased expression of Mir15a/Mir16-1 target genes and plasma cell proliferation, which was similarly observed in patients with MM.","['Chesi, Marta', 'Stein, Caleb K', 'Garbitt, Victoria M', 'Sharik, Meaghen E', 'Asmann, Yan W', 'Bergsagel, Matteo', 'Riggs, Daniel L', 'Welsh, Seth J', 'Meermeier, Erin W', 'Kumar, Shaji K', 'Braggio, Esteban', 'Bergsagel, P Leif']","['Chesi M', 'Stein CK', 'Garbitt VM', 'Sharik ME', 'Asmann YW', 'Bergsagel M', 'Riggs DL', 'Welsh SJ', 'Meermeier EW', 'Kumar SK', 'Braggio E', 'Bergsagel PL']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4024-8225', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1523-7388', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1523-7388']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona. chesi.marta@mayo.edu.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Division of Health Science Research, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, Arizona.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Cancer Discov,Blood cancer discovery,101764786,,,,PMC7494232,,,2020/09/22 06:00,2020/09/22 06:01,['2020/09/21 06:26'],"['2020/09/21 06:26 [entrez]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1158/0008-5472.BCD-19-0068 [doi]', '0008-5472.BCD-19-0068 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cancer Discov. 2020 Jul;1(1):68-81. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.BCD-19-0068.,,"['R01 CA168762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA224018/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA186781/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA190045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA234181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest'],['NIHMS1626624'],,['Blood Cancer Discov. 2020 Jun 22;1(1):16-17.

Thus, more attention should be paid to attenuate the protection of leukemic cells by MSCs. By examining the gene expression files of MSCs from healthy donors and AML patients through high-throughput microarrays, we found that interleukin (IL)-6 was an important cytokine secreted by AML MSCs to protect leukemic cells, contributing to disease progression. Strikingly, Aurora A (AURKA) was activated by IL-6, offering a new target to interfere with leukemia. Importantly, a novel AURKA inhibitor, PW21, showed excellent AURKA kinase inhibitory activities and attenuated the interaction of leukemic cells and the microenvironment. PW21 inhibited MSC-induced cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, and it induced cell apoptosis. Mechanically, PW21 could inhibit IL-6 secreted by MSCs. Moreover, we found that PW21 displayed a strong anti-leukemia effect on non-obese diabetic (NOD)-severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and murine MLL-AF9 leukemic models. PW21 significantly prolonged the survival of leukemic mice and eliminated the leukemic progenitor cells.

The FDA has approved arsenic trioxide (As2O3) for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treatment. However, its role in SCLC-derived cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains largely unknown. Methods: CSCs were enriched from SCLC cell lines by culturing them as spheres in conditioned serum-free medium. Then, qPCR, western blot, serial passage, limiting dilution, Transwell, and tumorigenesis assay were performed to verify the cells' stem phenotypic characteristics. Anticancer efficiency of As2O3 was assessed in these cells using CCK8, colony formation, sphere formation, flow cytometry, qPCR, western blot analysis in vitro, and tumor growth curve, immunofluorescence, and TUNEL staining analyses in vivo. Results: The fifth-passage SCLC spheres showed a potent self-renewal capacity, higher clonal formation efficiency (CFE), SOX2, c-Myc, NANOG, and OCT4 levels, and invasion ability, and stronger tumorigenesis capacity than the parental SCLC cells, indicating that the SCLC sphere cells displayed CSC features. As2O3 inhibited the proliferation, clonality and sphere forming ability of SCLC-derived CSCs and suppressed the tumor growth of CSCs-derived xenograft tumors. As2O3 induced apoptosis and downregulation of SOX2 and c-Myc in vitro and in xenografts. Besides, SOX2 knockdown suppressed SCLC-derived CSCs to self-renew and induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, expression of GLI1 (a key transcription factor of Hedgehog pathway) and its downstream genes increased in SCLC-derived CSCs, compared to the parental cells. As2O3 dramatically downregulated GLI1 and its downstream genes in vitro and in vivo. The GLI inhibitor (GANT-61) recapitulated and enhanced the effects of As2O3 on SCLC-derived CSCs, including growth suppression, apoptosis induction, and GLI1, SOX2 and c-Myc downregulation. Conclusions: Altogether, As2O3 effectively suppressed SCLC-derived CSCs growth by downregulating stem cell-maintenance factors and inducing apoptosis. These effects are mediated at least partly via the Hedgehog signaling blockade.","['Chang, Ke-Jie', 'Yin, Ji-Zhong', 'Huang, Hai', 'Li, Bing', 'Yang, Meng-Hang']","['Chang KJ', 'Yin JZ', 'Huang H', 'Li B', 'Yang MH']",,"['Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun-Yat-Sen University, Zhuhai, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Transl Lung Cancer Res,Translational lung cancer research,101646875,,,,PMC7481635,['NOTNLM'],"['Hedgehog signaling', 'SOX2', 'Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)', 'arsenic trioxide', 'cancer stem cells (CSCs)']",2020/09/22 06:00,2020/09/22 06:01,['2020/09/21 06:15'],"['2020/09/21 06:15 [entrez]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/tlcr-20-467 [doi]', 'tlcr-09-04-1379 [pii]']",ppublish,Transl Lung Cancer Res. 2020 Aug;9(4):1379-1396. doi: 10.21037/tlcr-20-467.,['2020 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

We assessed the expressions of 22 genes in the p53 pathway in 30 CLL patients and 15 healthy subjects by a RT2 Profiler PCR (polymerase chain reaction) Array technique and their relation to cytogenetic aberrations detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Our Student's t-test results indicated that ATM, ATR, BAX, CASP9, CDK4, CDKN2A, CHEK1, CHEK2, E2F3, MCL1, MDM2, MDM4, PCNA, RB1, P53 and BCL2 genes were statistically significant (p <0.001). For six genes (APAF1, CDKN1A, E2F1, GADD45A, PTEN and PTX3) were not statistically significant. The ATM, ATR, BAX, CASP9, CDK4, CDKN1A, CDKN2A, CHEK1, CHEK2, MDM2, MDM4, PCNA, RB1, P53, E2F1, GADD45A and BCL2 genes were found to be upregulated by the 2(-Ct) (relative fold change in gene expression) method. The highest up-regulation was detected in CDKN2A and BCL2 genes, 10.22- and 8.51-fold, respectively. On the other hand, the PTX3 gene with a fold regulation of 1.84 was found to the highest downregulation. Overall, the CDNK2A BCL2 and PTX3 genes are related to the mechanism of the disease in the p53 pathway and may be an important predictor of the prognosis of the disease. The BCL2 gene may be associated with increased risk of developing CLL. We suggest that the PTX3 gene may be considered as a marker associated with CLL disease. The CDKN2A gene expression seems to play a protective role in CLL.","['Oztan, G', 'Aktan, M', 'Palanduz, S', 'Issever, H', 'Ozturk, S', 'Nikerel, E', 'Ucur, A', 'Bagatir, G', 'Bayrak, A', 'Cefle, K']","['Oztan G', 'Aktan M', 'Palanduz S', 'Issever H', 'Ozturk S', 'Nikerel E', 'Ucur A', 'Bagatir G', 'Bayrak A', 'Cefle K']",,"['Division of Medical Genetics, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Istanbul University Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Public Health, Istanbul University Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Genetics and Bioengineering, Yeditepe University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200826,Poland,Balkan J Med Genet,Balkan journal of medical genetics : BJMG,9806959,,,,PMC7474212,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'Prognosis', 'RT2 Profiler PCR (polymerase chain reaction)Array', 'gene expression', 'p53 Pathway']",2020/09/22 06:00,2020/09/22 06:01,['2020/09/21 06:13'],"['2020/09/21 06:13 [entrez]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2478/bjmg-2020-0007 [doi]', 'bjmg-2020-0007 [pii]']",epublish,Balkan J Med Genet. 2020 Aug 26;23(1):15-24. doi: 10.2478/bjmg-2020-0007. eCollection 2020 Jun.,"['(c) 2020 Oztan G, Aktan M, Palanduz S, Issever H, Ozturk S, Nikerel E, Ucur A,', 'Bagatir G, Bayrak B, Cefle K, published by Sciendo.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rapid treatment of abnormally elevated potassium levels is essential due to the increased risk of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias. However, there are a number of circumstances that can lead to falsely elevated serum potassium levels, including fist clenching during phlebotomy and hemolysis of hematocytes during laboratory processing. Here we present a case of an elderly woman with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who presented with lower left quadrant pain and hematochezia. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated serum potassium level (7.5 mmol/L) on initial testing, in the absence of hyperkalemia symptoms, EKG changes, and hemolysis of the blood specimen. Abdominal CT revealed inflammatory changes consistent with diverticulitis.

We present a 40-year-old male who developed promyelocytic blast crisis 17 months after CML diagnosis, confirmed by the presence of the t(15;17) and t(9;22) translocations in the leukemic cells. Preserved nucleic acids from routine BCR-ABL1 testing provided a unique opportunity to evaluate clonal progression over time. Retrospective analysis demonstrated PML-RARA fusion transcripts were first detectable 8 months prior to blast crisis presentation. A review of 21 cases of promyelocytic blasts crisis published in the literature reveals a male predominance with earlier age at onset as compared to females. Interestingly, TKI therapy during chronic phase did not impact the time interval between diagnosis and promyelocytic blast crisis. Treatment with standard acute promyelocytic leukemia regimens provides more favorable outcomes with complete molecular remission. Although rare, it is important to consider a promyelocytic blast crisis when evaluating for transformation of CML due to its effective treatment with specific therapies.","['Wolanin, Stephanie', 'McCall, Robert K', 'Pettenati, Mark J', 'Beaty, Michael W', 'Insuasti-Beltran, Giovanni', 'Powell, Bayard L', ""O'Neill, Stacey S""]","['Wolanin S', 'McCall RK', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Beaty MW', 'Insuasti-Beltran G', 'Powell BL', ""O'Neill SS""]",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7006-9615'],"['Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Department of Pathology, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Molecular Pathology Laboratory Network, Maryville, TN, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Department of Pathology, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Department of Pathology, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Department of Pathology, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Section on Hematology and Oncology, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Department of Pathology, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200901,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,PMC7481999,,,2020/09/22 06:00,2020/09/22 06:01,['2020/09/21 06:10'],"['2020/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/21 06:10 [entrez]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/8830595 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2020 Sep 1;2020:8830595. doi: 10.1155/2020/8830595. eCollection 2020.,['Copyright (c) 2020 Stephanie Wolanin et al.'],,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In more than 95% of CML patients, the typical BCR-ABL1 transcript subtypes are e13a2 (b2a2), e14a2 (b3a2), or the simultaneous expression of both. Other less frequent transcript subtypes, such as e1a2, e2a2, e6a2, e19a2, e1a3, e13a3, and e14a3, have been sporadically reported. The main purpose of this review is to assess the possible impact of different transcripts on the response rate to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the achievement of stable deep molecular responses (s-DMR), the potential maintenance of treatment-free remission (TFR), and long-term outcome of CML patients treated with TKIs. According to the majority of published studies, patients with e13a2 transcript treated with imatinib have lower and slower cytogenetic and molecular responses than those with e14a2 transcript. They should be considered a high-risk group that would most benefit from frontline treatment with second-generation TKIs (2GTIKIs). Although few studies have been published, similar significant differences in response rates to 2GTKIs have been not reported. The e14a2 transcript seems to be a favorable prognostic factor for obtaining s-DMR, irrespective of the TKI received, and is also associated with a very high rate of TFR maintenance. Indeed, patients with e13a2 transcript achieve a lower rate of s-DMR and experience a higher probability of TFR failure. According to most reported data in the literature, the type of transcript does not seem to affect long-term outcomes of CML patients treated with TKIs. In TFR, the e14a2 transcript appears to be related to favorable responses. 2GTKIs as frontline therapy might be a convenient approach in patients with e13a2 transcript to achieve optimal long-term outcomes.","['Molica, Matteo', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Breccia, Massimo']","['Molica M', 'Abruzzese E', 'Breccia M']",,"['Haematology Unit, S.

It is not clear why the majority of HTLV-1-infected individuals remain asymptomatic carries (ACs) and a minority develop ATL. Cellular immune response has a critical role in ATL and destroys malignant and HTLV-1-infected cells. Perforin and granzyme have important functional roles in apoptosis and destruction of infected cells. In the present study we examined the role of perforin and granzyme in ATL patients and ACs. Materials and Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from ATL patients and ACs by using Ficoll-hypaque density centrifugation. RNA was extracted and cDNA was synthesized. A real-time PCR TaqMan method was designed and optimized for evaluation of perforin, granzyme, tax, and HBZ gene expression. HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) was quantified in patients with ATL and ACs. Results: The mRNA expression of tax and HBZ was significantly higher in ATL patients than ACs (P=0.011 and P=0.0001,respectively). The HTLV-1 PVL was higher in ATL patients compared to with AC group (P=0.015). There was a significant increase in perforin gene expression in ACs compared with ATL patients (P=0.002). Furthermore, the expression of granzyme was also higher in ACs compared with ATL patients, and significant differences were observed between the two groups (P=0.036). Conclusion: Low expression of perforin and granzyme in ATL patients seems to influence the efficiency of CTL function and destruction of HTLV-1-infected cells, which might contribute to the disease pathogenesis.","['Akbarin, Mohammad Mehdi', 'Farhadi, Sadegh', 'Allahyari, Abolghasem', 'Koshayar, Mohammad Mehdi', 'Shirdel, Abbas', 'Rahimi, Hossein', 'Rezaee, Seyed Abdolrahim', 'Mahdifar, Maryam', 'Mozaheb, Zahra', 'Mohamadi, Asadollah', 'Bari, Alireza', 'Mohaddes, SeyedehTahereh', 'Rafatpanah, Houshang']","['Akbarin MM', 'Farhadi S', 'Allahyari A', 'Koshayar MM', 'Shirdel A', 'Rahimi H', 'Rezaee SA', 'Mahdifar M', 'Mozaheb Z', 'Mohamadi A', 'Bari A', 'Mohaddes S', 'Rafatpanah H']",,"['Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology Department, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology Department, Imam Reza Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology Department, Imam Reza Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology Department, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology Department, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology Department, Imam Reza Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology Department, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology Department, Ghaem Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Division, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Basic Med Sci,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,101517966,,,,PMC7478263,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'Granzyme', 'HTLV-1', 'Perforin', 'Proviral load']",2020/09/22 06:00,2020/09/22 06:01,['2020/09/21 06:07'],"['2020/09/21 06:07 [entrez]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22038/ijbms.2020.38454.9602 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran J Basic Med Sci. 2020 Aug;23(8):1007-1011. doi: 10.22038/ijbms.2020.38454.9602.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed records of eight consecutive knees in six patients with extensive osteonecrosis of the distal femoral condyles, from 2013 to 2015. All patients were treated with autologous bone grafts using medulloscopy. We evaluated functional and objective Knee Society Score (KSS) pre- and postoperatively. Clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated at the last follow-up. Results: The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 21.5 years. The mean follow-up period was 45 months. No additional surgery was required during the follow-up period. The mean objective KSS significantly increased from 60.6 points (range 55-65) to 90.0 points (range 70-95), postoperatively (p < 0.001). The mean functional KSS significantly improved from 48.8 points (range 45-55) to 90.0 points (range 80-100) postoperatively (p < 0.001). No patients had progression of collapse of the femoral condyles at the final follow-up. At the final follow-up, the onset of minimal osteoarthritis was seen in two knees, with a Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1. Conclusion: Medulloscopy-assisted bone grafting can be an effective treatment option for early symptomatic osteonecrosis of knee following treatment for adolescent leukemia.","['Choi, Eun Seok', 'Shin, Hyun Dae']","['Choi ES', 'Shin HD']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2874-6675'],"['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Chungnam National University School of Medicine, Chungnam National University Hospital, 266 Munhwa-ro, Jung-gu, Daejeon, 35015 Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Chungnam National University School of Medicine, Chungnam National University Hospital, 266 Munhwa-ro, Jung-gu, Daejeon, 35015 Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200506,Switzerland,Indian J Orthop,Indian journal of orthopaedics,0137736,,,,PMC7474035,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone endoscopy', 'Bone graft', 'Knee', 'Medulloscopy', 'Osteonecrosis']",2020/09/22 06:00,2020/09/22 06:01,['2020/09/21 06:07'],"['2020/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/21 06:07 [entrez]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s43465-020-00126-2 [doi]', '126 [pii]']",epublish,Indian J Orthop. 2020 May 6;54(Suppl 1):27-32. doi: 10.1007/s43465-020-00126-2. eCollection 2020 Sep.,['(c) Indian Orthopaedics Association 2020.'],,"['Conflict of interestThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.', 'The manuscript has been read and approved by all the authors.

It urges scientists to stop criticizing the LNT model that links radiation to a risk of cancer and accept regulatory use of the threshold model to ""protect"" people, but with higher limits. It fails to mention the 120-year history of successful low-dose treatments of a wide variety of serious diseases, including cancers. The commentary ignores published evidence of a threshold at 1.1 Gy for radiogenic leukemia and a dose-rate threshold at about 0.6 Gy per year for lifespan shortening. LNT came from politicized science, replete with scientific misconduct and conflict of interest. Its acceptance created a false cancer scare that was likely intended to stop atomic bomb testing, but it has severely damaged human welfare. Many vitally important low-dose therapies were discarded when the radiation scare was disseminated in 1956. The rapid growth of nuclear energy ended with the media-inflamed public panic after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. Extreme implementation of the precautionary principle made it uneconomic.

The introduction of novel oral agents, starting with ibrutinib in 2013, has revolutionized the therapeutic landscape; however, clinical trials have suggested an association between ibrutinib and the risk of bleeding-related adverse events and atrial fibrillation (Afib) in patients with CLL. Methods: Patients diagnosed and treated for CLL at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) from 2010 to 2014 were followed until December 31, 2016, death, or lack of utilization of hematology/oncology services for >/= 18 months; or until incidence of another cancer. Treatments dispensed, evidence of VHA system use, bleeding events, and Afib were determined from the administrative records, laboratory records, pharmacy dispensation records, and clinical notes in the electronic healthcare record. Results: From 2010 to 2014, 2,796 patients were diagnosed and received care for CLL within the VHA, of whom 172 patients received ibrutinib and 291 received bendamustine + rituximab (BR). The use of anticoagulants following induction therapy did not differ between BR and ibrutinib patients (9% vs 8%, respectively), nor did the use of antiplatelets agents (6% vs 2%, respectively). Of the 291 patients that received BR, 12 (4%) developed a bleeding event compared with 20 (12%) who received ibrutinib. Additionally, 13 (8%) ibrutinib patients developed Afib compared with 9 (3%) BR patients. Conclusions: Real-world evidence from a nationwide cohort of patients with CLL suggests that while ibrutinib is associated with increased bleeding-related adverse events and Afib, the risk is comparable to those reported in previous clinical trials. These findings suggest that patients in real-world clinical care settings with higher levels of comorbidities may be at an increased risk for bleeding events and Afib.","['Rasmussen, Kelli M', 'Patil, Vikas', 'Burningham, Zachary', 'Yong, Christina', 'Sauer, Brian C', 'Halwani, Ahmad S']","['Rasmussen KM', 'Patil V', 'Burningham Z', 'Yong C', 'Sauer BC', 'Halwani AS']",,"['is a Senior Research Analyst at the University of Utah School of Medicine and the George E.

Aneuploidy is physiologically associated with significant cellular stress but, paradoxically, it favors tumor progression. Although more common in solid tumors, different forms of aneuploidy represent the initiating oncogenic lesion in patients with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), making B-ALL an excellent model for studying the role of aneuploidy in tumorigenesis.

It has become important to assess long-term complications in survivors. To assess neurological abnormalities in children treated by transplantation, diffusion tensor imaging was performed. METHODS: Forty children who underwent head diffusion tensor imaging before and after their first transplantation were enrolled. Patients with brain lesions on conventional MRI were excluded. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were compared between patients and 28 control subjects using tract-based spatial statistics. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was administered as a behavioral evaluation after transplantation, and diffusion tensor images of patients with and without behavioral abnormalities were compared. RESULTS: The age of patients and controls was 0 to 19 years and 0 to 16 years, respectively. The date of diffusion tensor imaging was 10 to 57 days before and 40 to 153 days after transplantation. Tract-based spatial statistics showed fractional anisotropy reduction in widespread white matter in patients before and after transplantation. Mean diffusivity was high before transplantation and normalized after transplantation. Analysis comparing before and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation shows no difference in fractional anisotropy and a higher mean diffusivity before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In patients with behavioral abnormalities, low fractional anisotropy and high mean diffusivity remained after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging showed white matter abnormalities in children without conventional MRI abnormalities, which were related to behavioral problems after transplantation. Diffusion tensor imaging is useful for behavioral assessment in children undergoing transplantation.","['Sakaguchi, Yoko', 'Natsume, Jun', 'Kidokoro, Hiroyuki', 'Tanaka, Masaharu', 'Okai, Yu', 'Ito, Yuji', 'Yamamoto, Hiroyuki', 'Ohno, Atsuko', 'Nakata, Tomohiko', 'Nakane, Toshiki', 'Kawai, Hisashi', 'Taoka, Toshiaki', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Naganawa, Shinji', 'Takahashi, Yoshiyuki']","['Sakaguchi Y', 'Natsume J', 'Kidokoro H', 'Tanaka M', 'Okai Y', 'Ito Y', 'Yamamoto H', 'Ohno A', 'Nakata T', 'Nakane T', 'Kawai H', 'Taoka T', 'Muramatsu H', 'Naganawa S', 'Takahashi Y']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan; Brain and Mind Research Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan; Department of Developmental Disability Medicine, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.

Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is frequently encountered in the postinfusion period of CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy and in some cases may be fatal. Knowledge related to the spectrum of imaging findings of CD19-targeted CAR-T cell therapy-related ICANS is, however, still very much lacking, underscoring the need for continued research in this area. In this review, we hope to provide an overview of current knowledge and provide an in-depth literature review related to this topic. A brief discussion of possible imaging differential diagnoses, specifically in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, will also be included. Illustrative cases for each imaging phenotype will be provided to facilitate a better understanding. A greater level of insight of the spectrum of imaging findings related to ICANS will improve patients' management and enhance efforts to safely deliver CAR-T cell immunotherapy. It will also facilitate further studies to derive mechanistic insights of ICANS and potentially assist in the testing and monitoring of therapeutic interventions.","['Tan, Ai Peng']",['Tan AP'],,"['Department of Diagnostic Radiology, National University Health System, Singapore.

Among the various CSC markers, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1, B cell-specific Moloney murine leukaemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi1), and octamer-binding protein 4 (OCT4) have been noted to increase in OSCC. The aim of the study was to analyze ALDH1, Bmi1, and OCT4 expression in OED and OSCC with clinicopathologic correlation and survival analysis. METHODS: A total of 40 cases each of OED and OSCC were retrieved from departmental archives. Expression of ALDH1, Bmi1, and OCT4 was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and was correlated with clinicopathological parameters. A follow-up ranging from 6 to 52 months was considered for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The log-rank test was performed to analyze significant difference in survival rates. RESULTS: The expression levels of ALDH1, Bmi1, and OCT4 increased significantly from OED through OSCC (P < .05). The expression of ALDH1 and OCT4 showed a significant correlation with lymph node metastasis. Positive cases of ALDH1 showed a significantly reduced survival rate compared to cases showing negative expression. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a significant reduction of survival rate (P = .00) in patients showing a positive expression for all the 3 markers. CONCLUSION: ALDH1 and OCT4 could be used as individual prognostic markers for assessing prognosis. ALDH1, Bmi1, and OCT4 could be used as a collective panel of markers to enable surgeons in predicting the prognosis of patients and thereby carry out prompt follow-up for such cases.","['Rao, Roopa S', 'Raju K, Lizbeth', 'Augustine, Dominic', 'Patil, Shankargouda']","['Rao RS', 'Raju K L', 'Augustine D', 'Patil S']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7246-5497'],"['Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, Faculty of Dental Sciences, 410981M.S.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind anti-CRC effect of genistein have not been elucidated. In current report, a systemic pharmacology analysis was used to disclose the anti-CRC mechanism of genistein prior to performing experimentative certification. As shown in network pharmacology findings, a total of 189 common targets and 9 hard-core targets of genistein-anti-CRC were collected and identified. And the detailed anti-CRC functions and pathways mediated by genistein were uncovered. In further certification, human CRC samples resulted in elevated protein and mRNA expressions of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL1), beta amyloid A4 protein (APP), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (KDR). In animal experiment, genistein-treated tumor-transplanted nude mice exhibited reduced tumor growth, accompanied with dose-dependent down-regulations of MCL1, APP, and KDR proteins and mRNAs. Taken together, the integrated bioinformatic and experimental findings uncover the anti-CRC mechanisms and targets mediated by genistein. Significantly, parts of hard-core biotargets were experimentally verified before clinical application, including MCL1, APP, and KDR.","['Zhang, Lei', 'Zhang, Junzhi', 'Gong, Yizhen', 'Lv, Lv']","['Zhang L', 'Zhang J', 'Gong Y', 'Lv L']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4815-8168'],"['Department of Emergency and Trauma Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Emergency and Trauma Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Emergency and Trauma Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.', 'Department of Emergency and Trauma Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University, Guilin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200920,Netherlands,Biofactors,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",8807441,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['colorectal cancer', 'genistein', 'mechanisms', 'network pharmacology', 'targets']",2020/09/21 06:00,2021/10/02 06:00,['2020/09/20 20:42'],"['2020/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/20 20:42 [entrez]']",['10.1002/biof.1677 [doi]'],ppublish,Biofactors. 2020 Nov;46(6):974-982. doi: 10.1002/biof.1677.

It is usually assumed that a short duration of aplasia could be a surrogate marker of poor therapeutic efficacy in clearing bone marrow blasts, especially in older patients. No studies have evaluated the usefulness of such a surrogate marker in younger AML patients treated with intensive chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, we retrospectively assessed the role of white blood cell (WBC) count nadir and duration of aplasia in 68 patients with AML treated with intensive chemotherapy and potentially candidate to stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) bone marrow aplasia was 25 days, and the mean WBC count nadir from chemotherapy start was at day +12, whereas the median neutrophil recovery occurred at day +24. No significant differences were found between responders and nonresponders for mean aplasia duration (25 vs. 26 days, p value = 0.76), mean WBC count nadir (12 vs. 12 days, p value = 0.86), and median neutrophil recovery (24 vs. 24, p value = 0.67). DISCUSSION: The present study evaluated the potential prognostic role of WBC count nadir and duration of aplasia, demonstrating that they are not associated with treatment outcomes in adult patients with AML treated with intensive chemotherapy. Therefore, a short duration of aplasia seems not linked to poor therapeutic efficacy in clearing bone marrow blasts. Our findings, although needing validation in larger and more homogeneous cohorts, may offer helpful clues in the management of aplasia of AML patients.","['Marras, Tatiana', 'Dettori, Michael', 'Caocci, Giovanni', 'La Nasa, Giorgio', 'Sotgiu, Giovanni', 'Saderi, Laura', 'Fozza, Claudio']","['Marras T', 'Dettori M', 'Caocci G', 'La Nasa G', 'Sotgiu G', 'Saderi L', 'Fozza C']",,"['Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Experimental Sciences, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy, cfozza@uniss.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200918,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytes/*cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*cytology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Aplasia', 'Intensive chemotherapy', 'Nadir', 'White blood cell count']",2020/09/21 06:00,2021/06/05 06:00,['2020/09/20 20:38'],"['2020/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/20 20:38 [entrez]']","['000509816 [pii]', '10.1159/000509816 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2020;65(3-4):110-114. doi: 10.1159/000509816.

Wistar rats were administered flavonoids at a dose of 100 mg/(kg.bw)/day or 200 mg/(kg.bw)/day after exposed to 281.40 mg/(kg.bw)/day AlCl3.6H2O. The results of Morris water maze suggested that rutin and puerarin increased the frequency of crossing the platform and swimming time spent in the target quadrant of AlCl3-induced rats significantly. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay indicated that three flavonoids could alleviate apoptosis of hippocampal neurons induced by AlCl3. Real time-PCR and western blot suggested that rutin, puerarin and 100 mg/(kg.bw)/day silymarin could decrease the AlCl3-induced high expression of Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) mRNA and protein in hippocampus, but the expression of B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) mRNA and protein was not significantly different among groups. Flavonoids could up regulate the low expression of autophagy related proteins (Beclin 1 (Bcl-2-interacting protein with a coiled-coil domain 1) and LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3)) caused by AlCl3 exposure. Flavonoids could also adjust the change in adenosine triphosphatase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and malondialdehyde induced by intake of AlCl3. The results of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) suggested that flavonoids could effectively reduce the high Al level in brain and serum of AlCl3 exposed rats. In conclusion, three flavonoids may improve learning and memory function by inhibiting excessive apoptosis and oxidative stress in AlCl3 exposed rats.","['Li, Shuling', 'Zhang, Qiongyao', 'Ding, Yun', 'Wang, Xin', 'Liu, Ping']","['Li S', 'Zhang Q', 'Ding Y', 'Wang X', 'Liu P']",,"['Department of Hygiene Detection, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.', 'Department of Hygiene Detection, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.', 'Department of Hygiene Detection, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.', 'Department of Hygiene Detection, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.', 'Department of Hygiene Detection, School of Public Health, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, China.

Endometrial receptivity is well known to be crucial for embryo implantation. This study aims to investigate the effect of aPL on endometrial receptivity in RIF women with positive aPL. METHODS: Sixty-four infertile women with normal menstrual cycles were enrolled. The control group comprised 32 pregnant women with negative aPL who conceived successfully after their first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) cycle, and the RIF group comprised 32 women with positive aPL. Endometrial biopsy samples were collected seven days after the luteinizing hormone surge (LH + 7). The expression of LIF and HOXA10 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and Western blot. Endometrial pinopode development was examined by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of LIF and HOXA10 in the RIF group was significantly decreased compared with that in the control group during the implantation window. The immunohistochemistry and Western blot results confirmed these findings. Then, ultrastructural analyses of endometrial cells showed fewer pinopode processes, a more atypical morphology and increased atrophy in the RIF group compared with the control group, and these results were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: aPL positivity may inhibit the expression of LIF and HOXA10 in the endometrium and influence pinopode development. Our findings suggest that positivity for aPL is associated with impaired endometrial receptivity, which results in the development of RIF.","['Tan, Xiaofang', 'Ding, Jiayi', 'Pu, Danhua', 'Wu, Jie']","['Tan X', 'Ding J', 'Pu D', 'Wu J']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University/Jiangsu Province Hospital/Jiangsu Women and Children Health Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China; Affiliated Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, 226006, China.', 'Affiliated Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, 226006, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University/Jiangsu Province Hospital/Jiangsu Women and Children Health Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, China.

The most prevalent form of leukemia in adults, AML is predominantly an age-related disorder and accounts for more than 10,000 deaths per year in the United States alone. In comparison to solid tumors, AML has an overall low mutational burden, albeit more than 70% of AML patients harbor somatic mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifiers and chromatin regulators. In the past decade, discoveries highlighting the role of DNA and histone modifications in determining cellular plasticity and lineage commitment have attested to the importance of epigenetic contributions to tumor cell de-differentiation and heterogeneity, tumor initiation, maintenance, and relapse. Orchestration in histone methylation levels regulates pluripotency and multicellular development. The increasing number of reversible methylation regulators being identified, including histone methylation writer, reader, and eraser enzymes, and their implications in AML pathogenesis have widened the scope of epigenetic reprogramming, with multiple drugs currently in various stages of preclinical and clinical trials. AML methylome also determines response to conventional chemotherapy, as well as AML cell interaction within a tumor-immune microenvironment ecosystem. Here we summarize the latest developments focusing on molecular derangements in histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and histone demethylases (HDMs) in AML pathogenesis. AML-associated HMTs and HDMs, through intricate crosstalk mechanisms, maintain an altered histone methylation code conducive to disease progression. We further discuss their importance in governing response to therapy, which can be used as a biomarker for treatment efficacy. Finally we deliberate on the therapeutic potential of targeting aberrant histone methylome in AML, examine available small molecule inhibitors in combination with immunomodulating therapeutic approaches and caveats, and discuss how future studies can enable posited epigenome-based targeted therapy to become a mainstay for AML treatment.","['Boila, Liberalis Debraj', 'Sengupta, Amitava']","['Boila LD', 'Sengupta A']",,"['Stem Cell & Leukemia Laboratory, Cancer Biology & Inflammatory Disorder Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Jadavpur, Kolkata, West Bengal, India; Translational Research Unit of Excellence, Salt Lake, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Stem Cell & Leukemia Laboratory, Cancer Biology & Inflammatory Disorder Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Jadavpur, Kolkata, West Bengal, India; Translational Research Unit of Excellence, Salt Lake, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.

MAIN METHODS: Twenty rats in two groups of 10 were used. Group I was perfused with normal saline (NS) in the right uterine horn and 95% ethanol in the left one. Group II was bilaterally perfused with 95% ethanol into the uterine horns. After three estrous cycles, Group II was perfused with NS in the right uterine horn and G-CSF (30 mug/kg) in the left one. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were used to detect changes in endometrial thickness and expression of cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and vimentin (Vim). The relative expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) and leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif) were also tested via reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western-blot analyses. KEY FINDINGS: G-CSF treatment significantly increased the thickness of the endometrium in the 95% ethanol-induced thin-endometrium rat model. The expression levels of endometrial glandular epithelial cell marker for CK19 and stromal cell marker Vim were augmented in the G-CSF-treated group compared with the control group. Moreover, G-CSF treatment stimulated the expression of VEGF and LIF in the 95% ethanol-induced thin-endometrium rat model. SIGNIFICANCE: G-CSF intrauterine perfusion improved endometrial receptivity in the thin-endometrium rat model by stimulating endometrial proliferation and angiogenesis.","['Xie, Yiran', 'Tian, Zhengping', 'Qi, Qianrong', 'Li, Zheyun', 'Bi, Yin', 'Qin, Aiping', 'Yang, Yihua']","['Xie Y', 'Tian Z', 'Qi Q', 'Li Z', 'Bi Y', 'Qin A', 'Yang Y']",,"['Research Center for Guangxi Reproductive Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China; Reproductive Medicine Center, the Affiliated Hospital, Guilin Medical College, Guilin, China; Reproductive Medicine Center, Taihe Hospital, Hubei Medical University, Shiyan, China.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, the Affiliated Hospital, Guilin Medical College, Guilin, China.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Reproductive Medicine Center, the Affiliated Hospital, Guilin Medical College, Guilin, China.', 'Research Center for Guangxi Reproductive Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Research Center for Guangxi Reproductive Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Research Center for Guangxi Reproductive Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.

Here we hypothesized that sequential chemoradiation therapy (sCRT) is better tolerated than concurrent (cCRT) but confers acceptable efficacy. We evaluated these strategies in older adults utilizing Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pooled analyses from 6 first-line stage III NSCLC CRT trials (Cancer and Leukemia Group B 8433, 8831, 9130, 30106, 30407, 39801) were used to compare toxicity and survival outcomes with cCRT versus sCRT in patients age >/= 65 years. Grade 3-5 adverse events (AEs), progression-free and overall survival (PFS; OS) are reported with adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: Four hundred older adults, of whom 106 (26.5%) had received sCRT and 294 (73.5%) had received cCRT, comprised the cohorts. Virtually all had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0-1 (99%). More grade 3-5 AEs were observed at any time-point with cCRT than sCRT (94.2% versus 86.8%; 95% confidence interval for difference in proportions, 1.3%, 15.5%) and this finding remained after adjusting for length of study treatment (P = 0.018). Comparable PFS and OS were observed with sCRT versus cCRT (median: 8.0 versus 9.2 months; median: 11.9 versus 13.4 months, respectively) even after adjustment for age, sex, ECOG PS, body mass index, pretreatment weight loss, stage, and cisplatin-based therapy (P = 0.604 and P = 0.906, respectively). DISCUSSION: These data show that sCRT was associated with less toxicity than cCRT with no associated statistically significant decrease in efficacy outcomes and that sCRT merits further study in this population.","['Maggiore, Ronald J', 'Zahrieh, David', 'McMurray, Ryan P', 'Feliciano, Josephine L', 'Samson, Pamela', 'Mohindra, Pranshu', 'Chen, Hongbin', 'Wong, Melisa L', 'Lafky, Jacqueline M', 'Jatoi, Aminah', 'Le-Rademacher, Jennifer G']","['Maggiore RJ', 'Zahrieh D', 'McMurray RP', 'Feliciano JL', 'Samson P', 'Mohindra P', 'Chen H', 'Wong ML', 'Lafky JM', 'Jatoi A', 'Le-Rademacher JG']",,"['University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, United States of America.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States of America; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States of America.

For example, certain B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia are weakly sensitive to treatment with CAR T cells. Co-expression of proinflamatory cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-18 by CAR T cells have been shown to enhance their antitumor function. We similarly engineered CAR T cell to co-express IL-21 and studied the effects of IL-21 on CAR T cells specific to CD19 and prostate-specific membrane antigens using an in vitro co-culture model and NSG mice transplanted with B-cell tumors. RESULTS: IL-21 enhanced the expansion of CAR T cells after antigenic stimulation, reduced the level of apoptosis of CAR T cells during co-culture with tumor cells and prevented differentiation of CAR T cells toward late memory phenotypes. In addition, induced secretion of IL-21 by CAR T cells promoted tumor infiltration by CD19-specific CAR (CAR19) T cells in NSG mice, resulting in reduced tumor growth. By co-culturing CAR19 T cells with bone-marrow fragments infiltrated with CLL cells we demonstrate that IL-21 reduces the immunosupressive activity of CLL cells against CAR19 T cells. CONCLUSIONS: CAR19 T cells armed with IL-21 exhibited enhanced antitumor functions. IL-21 promoted their proliferation and cytotoxicity against chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The results suggest that arming CAR T cells with IL-21 could boost the effectiveness of CAR T-mediated therapies.","['Stach, Martin', 'Ptackova, Pavlina', 'Mucha, Martin', 'Musil, Jan', 'Klener, Pavel', 'Otahal, Pavel']","['Stach M', 'Ptackova P', 'Mucha M', 'Musil J', 'Klener P', 'Otahal P']",,"['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic; Faculty of Natural Sciences, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic; First Department of Medicine, Department of Haematology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic; Faculty of Natural Sciences, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'First Department of Medicine, Department of Haematology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic; First Department of Medicine, Department of Haematology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague and General University Hospital in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.

However, there is no cut-off level for serum APRIL (sAPRIL) levels that predict time to treatment in CLL patients. Materials and methods: Between May and December 2012, 94 consecutive CLL patients and 25 healthy controls were assessed. sAPRIL levels were measured by ELISA. Demographic data and prognostic markers were obtained from the patients' files. Treatment-naive patients were followed up for 6.5 years for any treatment need. Results: Patients were divided into 3 groups: Treatment-naive (n = 47), chemotherapy receiving (n = 25), and those who had received chemotherapy previously (n = 22). There was no difference in median sAPRIL levels of patients who were receiving chemotherapy at the sampling time and the healthy controls, which indicates that sAPRIL levels might be influenced by treatment. For treatment-naive patients, the best cut-off in predicting time to treatment was found at the sAPRIL level of 2.04 ng/mL, with 78% sensitivity and 63% specificity. Time to treatment was significantly earlier in the APRIL high group (n = 27) than in the APRIL low group (n = 20) (P = 0.010, log-rank test). Conclusion: sAPRIL, a simple, promising blood test which can be measured by ELISA, will likely obtain a place in the wide range of prognostic markers in CLL. Prospective large-scale studies are required to validate and confirm the feasibility of the proposed cut-off level of 2.04 ng/mL as a predictor of time to treatment in treatment-naive CLL patients.","['Esatoglu, Sinem Nihal', 'Keskin, Dilek', 'Eskazan, Ahmet Emre', 'Elverdi, Tugrul', 'Salihoglu, Ayse', 'Ar, Muhlis Cem', 'Ongoren, Seniz', 'Baslar, Zafer', 'Aydin, Yildiz', 'Uzun, Hafize', 'Soysal, Teoman']","['Esatoglu SN', 'Keskin D', 'Eskazan AE', 'Elverdi T', 'Salihoglu A', 'Ar MC', 'Ongoren S', 'Baslar Z', 'Aydin Y', 'Uzun H', 'Soysal T']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5414-7305', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5332-3538', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9568-0894', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9496-5353', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8758-7945', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0332-9253', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2809-5510', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1807-7351', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7788-9501', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1347-8498', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7417-2118']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Rheumatology, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Biochemistry, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20210226,Turkey,Turk J Med Sci,Turkish journal of medical sciences,9441758,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (TNFSF13 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Medication Therapy Management', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Selection', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/*blood']",PMC7991891,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*chemotherapy', '*prognosis', '*treatment', '*survival']",2020/09/21 06:00,2021/11/03 06:00,['2020/09/20 17:34'],"['2020/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/20 17:34 [entrez]', '2020/09/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3906/sag-2004-282 [doi]'],epublish,Turk J Med Sci. 2021 Feb 26;51(1):348-354. doi: 10.3906/sag-2004-282.,"['This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International', 'License.']",,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-dose cytarabine (HDAC) is considered first choice in favorable risk and an option in intermediate-risk AML. However, its optimal dose and schedule, as well as the benefit of additional chemotherapy agents remain controversial. Herein, we report on the long-term outcome of consecutive unselected AML patients treated with repeated courses of HDAC, with the addition of idarubicin, followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) support, in order to limit toxicity, according to Northern Italy Leukemia Group (NILG) AML-01/00 study (EUDRACT number 00400673). Among 338 patients consecutively diagnosed from 2001 to 2017 at our center, 148 with high-risk AML (adverse cytogenetic, isolated FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutation, refractory to first induction) were addressed to allogeneic stem cell transplant. All other cases, 186 patients (55%), median age 53 (range 19-75), were considered standard-risk and received the NILG AML-01/00 program. After achieving CR, patients were mobilized with cytarabine 8 g/sqm to collect autologous CD34+-PBSC and received three consolidation cycles with HDAC (20 g/sqm) plus idarubicin (20 mg/sqm) per cycle, followed by reinfusion of limited doses of CD34+ PBSC (1-2x106/kg). The program was completed by 160 (86%) patients. Toxicity was acceptable. Neutrophils recovered a median of 10 days. Treatment-related mortality was 3/160 (1.8%). After a median follow-up of 66.4 months, overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) at 5-years were 61.4% and 52.4%, respectively. Twenty-eight selected patients aged >65 had similar outcomes. According to European leukemia net-2010 classification, the OS and RFS at 5-years were 76.4% and 65% in favorable risk, without differences between molecular subgroups, 52.3% and 47.2% in Intermediate-I, 45.2% and 36.5% in Intermediate-II risk patients, respectively. In conclusion, consolidation including repeated courses of high dose cytarabine and idarubicin, with limited PBSC support, proved feasible and very effective in nonhigh risk patients. The incorporation of novel agents in its backbone may be tested to further improve patient's prognosis.","['Borlenghi, Erika', 'Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Cerqui, Elisa', 'Archetti, Silvana', 'Bertoli, Diego', 'Bellotti, Daniela', 'Gramegna, Doriana', 'Soverini, Giulia', 'Oberti, Margherita', 'Schieppati, Francesca', 'Pagani, Chiara', 'Passi, Angela', 'Sciume, Margherita', 'Farina, Mirko', 'Carbone, Cecilia', 'Crippa, Claudia', 'Dalceggio, Daniela', 'Tucci, Alessandra', 'Rossi, Giuseppe']","['Borlenghi E', 'Cattaneo C', 'Cerqui E', 'Archetti S', 'Bertoli D', 'Bellotti D', 'Gramegna D', 'Soverini G', 'Oberti M', 'Schieppati F', 'Pagani C', 'Passi A', 'Sciume M', 'Farina M', 'Carbone C', 'Crippa C', 'Dalceggio D', 'Tucci A', 'Rossi G']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4666-3817'],"['Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Diagnostic Department, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Diagnostic Department, Clinical Chemistry Laboratory, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Laboratorio di Citogenetica e Genetica Medica, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Immunohematology and Trasfusion Medicine, Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200929,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'HDAC protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'consolidation', 'high dose cytarabine (HDAC)', 'outcome']",2020/09/20 06:00,2021/01/12 06:00,['2020/09/19 20:20'],"['2020/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/19 20:20 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2806 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2020 Dec;38(5):754-762. doi: 10.1002/hon.2806.

We aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which APL cells interact with endothelial cells (ECs) and to further explore how the endothelium affects bleeding as well as therapeutic interventions. METHOD: APL cells and an original APL cell line, NB4 cells, were used for experiments. The effects of leukaemic cells on ECs were analyzed in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the endothelial barrier function and procoagulant activity were detected. An APL mouse model was established for in vivo studies. FINDINGS: APL cells interacted with ECs via ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 receptors to disrupt endothelial integrity. This binding activated MLCK signaling, resulting in the trans-endothelial passage of protein and red blood cells (RBCs). Combined treatment with asiatic acid or anti-adhesion receptor antibody inhibited the response of ECs to APL cells, thereby preventing APL-associated haemorrhage in vitro and in vivo. Activated ECs exhibited a procoagulant phenotype after phosphatidylserine exposure. Plasma from APL patients formed a thin fibrin network between procoagulant ECs, and this intercellular fibrin decreased the passage of albumin and RBCs. Ex vivo addition of fibrinogen further enhanced this barrier function in a dose-dependent manner. INTERPRETATION: Endothelial damage induced by leukaemic cell adherence promotes haemorrhaging in APL. Stabilization of ECs, decreasing adhesion receptor expression, and increasing fibrinogen transfusion levels may be a new therapeutic avenue to alleviate this fatal bleeding complication.

Free-drugs combination has demonstrated enhanced therapeutic efficacy in AML, while it requires complicated administration regimens and brings added toxicity. To tackle this complex disease, in this work two clinically applied therapeutics, doxorubicin and homoharringtonine, were assembled into one polymeric micelle to form a co-delivery system (DHM) to facilitate a novel and simple administration regimen. The DHM was systematically investigated in the drug-resistant AML cell line HL60/A as well as in the AML1-ETO(+)-c-kit(+) mouse featuring as a refractory and relapsed AML model following comprehensive characterizations. Compared with the free-drugs combination, DHM significantly enhanced the cellular uptake of the therapeutics, inhibited the cell division and induced a higher rate of cells apoptosis in vitro. More importantly, the intraperitoneal injection of DHM remarkably eradicated leukemia cells in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, spleen and liver of the AML mice and significantly prolonged the survival of the mice without additional systematic toxicity compared with that of the free-drugs combination. In conclusion, the DHM boosted the therapeutic effect of clinically applied chemodrugs as well as provided a novel platform for multi-drugs co-delivery against refractory and relapsed AML, therefore holding promising potential for translational medicine.","['Yan, Doudou', 'Wei, Hui', 'Lai, Xinning', 'Ge, Yangyang', 'Xu, Shilin', 'Meng, Jie', 'Wen, Tao', 'Liu, Jian', 'Zhang, Weiqi', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Xu, Haiyan']","['Yan D', 'Wei H', 'Lai X', 'Ge Y', 'Xu S', 'Meng J', 'Wen T', 'Liu J', 'Zhang W', 'Wang J', 'Xu H']",,"['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, PR China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, PR China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, PR China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, PR China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, PR China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, PR China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, PR China.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, PR China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, PR China.

Here, we present a CML patient with e14a3 BCR-ABL1 transcript and t(9;22;12) variant Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. METHODS: Cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to identify the chromosomal aberrations and gene fusions. Rare fusion transcript was verified by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Breakpoints were characterized and validated using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) (Oxford, UK) and Sanger sequencing, respectively. RESULTS: The karyotype showed the translocation t(9;22;12)(q34;q11.2;q24) [20] and FISH indicated 40% positive BCR-ABL1 fusion signals. The RT-PCR suggested e14a3 type fusion transcript. The ONT sequencing analysis identified specific positions of translocation breakpoints: chr22:23633040-chr9:133729579, chr12:121567595-chr22:24701405, which were confirmed using Sanger sequencing. The patient achieved molecular remission 3 months after imatinib therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates Nanopore sequencing as a valid strategy, which can characterize breakpoints precisely in special clinical cases with atypical structural variations.

However, elimination of B cells by anti-CD19 CAR-T cells may lead to the reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and related hepatitis in patients with HBV infection. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of humanized anti-CD19 CAR-T (hCAR-T) therapy in B-cell malignancies with HBV infection. Twenty relapsed/refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients with HBV infection were treated with hCAR-T therapy. Among them, five hepatitis B antigen-positive patients who received antiviral prophylaxis did not develop HBV reactivation, including two patients who received both hCAR-T and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Among 15 patients with resolved HBV infection, two received antiviral prophylaxis, and the other 13 did not experience HBV reactivation without antiviral prophylaxis. One patient with resolved HBV infection experienced HBV reactivation 6 months after hCAR-T therapy and sequential allo-HSCT. Moreover, HBV infection did not affect in vivo expansion of hCAR-T cells or increase the risk of severe cytokine release syndrome. In conclusion, hCAR-T therapy is safe and effective in DLBCL and ALL patients with chronic and resolved HBV infection under proper antiviral prophylaxis.","['Cui, Rui', 'Lyu, Cuicui', 'Li, Qing', 'Jiang, Yanyu', 'Mou, Nan', 'Yang, Zhenxing', 'Liu, Xuxiang', 'Deng, Qi', 'Li, Lanfang']","['Cui R', 'Lyu C', 'Li Q', 'Jiang Y', 'Mou N', 'Yang Z', 'Liu X', 'Deng Q', 'Li L']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4994-5262'],"['Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Gene Therapy, Shanghai Genbase Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Gene Therapy, Shanghai Genbase Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', ""Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center of Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin's Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20201001,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Allografts', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hepatitis B virus/*physiology', 'Hepatitis B, Chronic/*prevention & control', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', '*Receptors, Chimeric Antigen', '*Virus Activation']",PMC7983916,['NOTNLM'],"['HBV reactivation', 'humanized anti-CD19 CAR-T', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'safety']",2020/09/20 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2020/09/19 12:06'],"['2020/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/19 12:06 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2807 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2021 Feb;39(1):75-86. doi: 10.1002/hon.2807.

The 5-year OS was significantly higher in AA patients than in MDS and acute leukemia patients (89%, 71%, and 44%, respectively). In the MDS/leukemia group, factors associated with poor outcome in univariate analysis were older age at HSCT (>/= 18 years), conditioning regimen without anti-thymocyte or lymphocyte globulin, and grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease. After 1 year, of 137 survivors, 15 developed subsequent malignancies, of whom 12 were diagnosed with head and neck (HN)/esophageal cancer. An irradiation regimen and older age were associated with the risk of HN/esophageal cancer. Five of seven deaths were attributed to subsequent malignancies more than 5 years after HSCT.

Here, we report a unique case of a child with viral pneumonia caused by coinfection with human metapneumovirus (MPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2 after HSCT. A 9-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent allogeneic HSCT from a matched, unrelated donor. During the post-transplant period, in profound leukopenia (below 10 leukocytes/microL), she was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, MPV, and RSV pneumonia and was treated with ribavirin and chloroquine. Before leukocyte recovery, the girl became asymptomatic, and SARS-CoV-2 and RSV clearance was achieved. The shedding of SARS-CoV-2 stopped before immune system recovery, and one may hypothesize that the lack of an inflammatory response might have been a contributing factor to the mild clinical course. Post-transplant care in HSCT recipients with COVID-19 infection is feasible in regular transplant units, provided the patient does not present with respiratory failure. Early and repeated testing for SARS-CoV-2 in post-transplant patients with concomitant infection mitigation strategies should be considered in children after HSCT who develop fever, respiratory symptoms, and perhaps gastrointestinal symptoms to control the spread of COVID-19 both in patients and in healthcare workers in hospital environments. Training of staff and the availability of personal protective equipment are crucial for containing SARS-CoV-2 infection.","['Jarmolinski, Tomasz', 'Matkowska-Kocjan, Agnieszka', 'Rosa, Monika', 'Olejnik, Igor', 'Gorczynska, Ewa', 'Kalwak, Krzysztof', 'Ussowicz, Marek']","['Jarmolinski T', 'Matkowska-Kocjan A', 'Rosa M', 'Olejnik I', 'Gorczynska E', 'Kalwak K', 'Ussowicz M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3441-6165', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7605-3879', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1585-3164', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4101-0435', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5709-6731', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1174-5799', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5725-4835']","['Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology, and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department and Clinic of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology, and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology, and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology, and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology, and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology, and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20201012,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,"['49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'COVID-19 drug treatment']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'COVID-19/complications/drug therapy/*immunology/*virology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Metapneumovirus', 'Pneumonia, Viral/complications/virology', 'Postoperative Period', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*therapy/virology', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/complications/therapy', 'Respiratory Syncytial Viruses', 'Ribavirin/therapeutic use', '*SARS-CoV-2', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC7537051,['NOTNLM'],"['*COVID19', '*SARS-CoV-2', '*metapneumovirus', '*pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*pneumonia', '*respiratory syncytial virus']",2020/09/20 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2020/09/19 05:35'],"['2020/08/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/19 05:35 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13875 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2021 Aug;25(5):e13875. doi: 10.1111/petr.13875.

Yet, its role in improving survival of patients referred to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in first complete remission (CR1) needs to be defined. METHODS: This multicenter study retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 119 FLT3-ITD AML patients [59 (49.6%) males and 60 females] intensively treated between 2015 and 2019 at five Israeli centers. In our cohort, allo-SCT in CR1 was widely implemented (47%) and patient stratification was based on the current allelic ratio (AR) cutoff of 0.5. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (82.3%) achieved CR1/CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi). Death during induction was reported in 7 (5.9%) patients. In multivariate analysis, midostaurin use and allo-SCT in CR1 were the most significant factors affecting overall survival (OS). Midostaurin incorporation in chemotherapy regimens significantly improved CR + CRi rates (P = .002), reduced relapse rates (P = .02), and was remarkably advantageous for high-AR patients (2-year OS 82%). In low-AR patients, the midostaurin effect was much less prominent. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate benefits of midostaurin incorporation in intensive chemotherapy regimens, particularly for high-AR AML patients to whom it should be offered along with allo-SCT in CR1.","['Ofran, Yishai', 'Leiba, Ronit', 'Frisch, Avraham', 'Horesh, Nurit', 'Henig, Israel', 'Yehudai-Ofir, Dana', 'Moshe, Yakir', 'Neaman, Miriam', 'Ganzel, Chezi', 'Gal-Rabinovich, Kinneret', 'Hellmann, Ilana', 'Weinstein, Vladimir', 'Berger, Tamar', 'Wolach, Ofir']","['Ofran Y', 'Leiba R', 'Frisch A', 'Horesh N', 'Henig I', 'Yehudai-Ofir D', 'Moshe Y', 'Neaman M', 'Ganzel C', 'Gal-Rabinovich K', 'Hellmann I', 'Weinstein V', 'Berger T', 'Wolach O']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5521-1337', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1722-4807']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Statistics, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Hematology Unit, Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Hematology Institute, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.', 'Hematology Institute, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20201006,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', '*Gene Frequency', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Staurosporine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication', 'midostaurin']",2020/09/20 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/09/19 05:35'],"['2020/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/19 05:35 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13518 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2021 Jan;106(1):64-71. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13518.

However, patients may suffer from persistent disease, relapse, clonal evolution, graft-versus-host disease and other late effects. Here, we analyse very long-term outcome of all AA patients at our institution comparing not only survival, but also response status and complications. METHODS: Patient charts of all 302 AA patients treated between 1973 and 2017 at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: First line treatment was IST in 226 (75%) and HCT in 76 (25%) patients. Overall survival at 30 years was similar in patients treated initially by HCT and IST (44% (+/-14%), and 40% (+/- 9%) respectively, with better results in more recent years. Partial and no response occurred more frequently after IST, relapse incidence after IST was 24 %, whereas non-engraftment and graft failure was documented in 15 patients (19 %) after HCT. Clonal evolution to myelodysplastic syndrome / acute myeloid leukemia was 16 % at 25 years in IST patients, 1.3 % in HCT patients, iron overload (18 versus 4 %, p = 0.002) and cardiovascular events (11 versus 1 %, p=0.011) occured significantly more often in IST than HCT treated patients. The majority of long-term survivors, 96% of those alive at 25 years, were in complete remission at last follow up, irrespective of the initial treatment modality. CONCLUSION: Very long term survivors after AA are those with stable hematopoietic recovery.","['Drexler, Beatrice', 'Zurbriggen, Felicitas', 'Diesch, Tamara', 'Viollier, Romaine', 'Halter, Joerg P', 'Heim, Dominik', 'Holbro, Andreas', 'Infanti, Laura', 'Buser, Andreas', 'Gerull, Sabine', 'Medinger, Michael', 'Tichelli, Andre', 'Passweg, Jakob R']","['Drexler B', 'Zurbriggen F', 'Diesch T', 'Viollier R', 'Halter JP', 'Heim D', 'Holbro A', 'Infanti L', 'Buser A', 'Gerull S', 'Medinger M', 'Tichelli A', 'Passweg JR']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7046-0825'],"['Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland. beatrice.drexler@usb.ch.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, University Children's Hospital Basel UKBB, Basel, Switzerland."", 'AUREA, General Practioner office, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Blood Transfusion Center, Swiss Red Cross, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Blood Transfusion Center, Swiss Red Cross, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Blood Transfusion Center, Swiss Red Cross, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200919,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allografts', '*Anemia, Aplastic/mortality/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Recovery of Function', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC7536165,['NOTNLM'],"['allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'aplastic anemia', 'immunosuppressive therapy', 'long-term outcome']",2020/09/20 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/09/19 05:33'],"['2020/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/19 05:33 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04271-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04271-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Nov;99(11):2529-2538. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04271-4.

Two recurrently mutated genes in CHIP and adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) encode for isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2). Global expression of mutant IDH2 in transgenic mice-induced dilated cardiomyopathy and muscular dystrophy. In this retrospective observational study, we investigated whether mutant IDH1/2 predisposes to cardiovascular disease in AML patients. Among 363 AML patients, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were detected in 26 (7.2%) and 39 patients (10.7%), respectively. Mutant IDH1 patients exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of coronary artery disease (26.1% vs. 6.4%, p = 0.002). Applying inverse probability-weighting analysis, patients with IDH1/2 mutations had a higher risk for a declining cardiac function during AML treatment compared to IDH1/2 wild type patients [left ventricular ejection fraction pretreatment compared to 10 months after diagnosis: 59.2% to 41.9% (p < 0.001) vs 58.5% to 55.4% (p = 0.27), respectively]. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing and immunostaining in hiPS-derived cardiomyocytes indicated that the oncometabolite R-2HG exacerbated doxorubicin mediated cardiotoxicity. Evaluation of IDH1/2 mutation status may therefore help identifying AML patients at risk for cardiovascular complications during cytotoxic treatment.","['Kattih, Badder', 'Shirvani, Amir', 'Klement, Piroska', 'Garrido, Abel Martin', 'Gabdoulline, Razif', 'Liebich, Alessandro', 'Brandes, Maximilian', 'Chaturvedi, Anuhar', 'Seeger, Timon', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Geffers, Robert', 'John, David', 'Bavendiek, Udo', 'Bauersachs, Johann', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Heineke, Joerg', 'Heuser, Michael']","['Kattih B', 'Shirvani A', 'Klement P', 'Garrido AM', 'Gabdoulline R', 'Liebich A', 'Brandes M', 'Chaturvedi A', 'Seeger T', 'Thol F', 'Gohring G', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Geffers R', 'John D', 'Bavendiek U', 'Bauersachs J', 'Ganser A', 'Heineke J', 'Heuser M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1324-5536', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9597-3010', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4409-016X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9341-117X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1541-3030', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5318-9044']","['Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Physiology, European Center for Angioscience (ECAS), Medical Faculty Mannheim of Heidelberg University, Ludolf-Krehl-Strasse 7-11, 68167, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Institute for Cardiovascular Regeneration, Goethe University Frankfurt, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Rhein/Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Physiology, European Center for Angioscience (ECAS), Medical Faculty Mannheim of Heidelberg University, Ludolf-Krehl-Strasse 7-11, 68167, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Heidelberg/Mannheim, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Genome Analytics, Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Institute for Cardiovascular Regeneration, Goethe University Frankfurt, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Center for Cardiovascular Research (DZHK), partner site Rhein/Main, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.

The selective Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199) in combination therapy has been approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, but resistance can be acquired through the upregulation of alternative antiapoptotic proteins. Here, we reported that a newly emerged histone deacetylase inhibitor, chidamide (CS055), at low-cytotoxicity dose enhanced the anti-AML activity of ABT-199, while sparing normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Moreover, we also found that chidamide showed a superior resensitization effect than romidepsin in potentiation of ABT-199 lethality. Inhibition of multiple HDACs rather than some single component might be required. The combination therapy was also effective in primary AML blasts and stem/progenitor cells regardless of disease status and genetic aberrance, as well as in a patient-derived xenograft model carrying FLT3-ITD mutation. Mechanistically, CS055 promoted leukemia suppression through DNA double-strand break and altered unbalance of anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL downregulation, and Bim upregulation). Taken together, these results show the high therapeutic potential of ABT-199/CS055 combination in AML treatment, representing a potent and alternative salvage therapy for the treatment of relapsed and refractory patients with AML.","['Chen, Kai', 'Yang, Qianying', 'Zha, Jie', 'Deng, Manman', 'Zhou, Yong', 'Fu, Guofeng', 'Bi, Silei', 'Feng, Liying', 'Xu-Monette, Zijun Y', 'Chen, Xiao Lei', 'Fu, Guo', 'Dai, Yun', 'Young, Ken H', 'Xu, Bing']","['Chen K', 'Yang Q', 'Zha J', 'Deng M', 'Zhou Y', 'Fu G', 'Bi S', 'Feng L', 'Xu-Monette ZY', 'Chen XL', 'Fu G', 'Dai Y', 'Young KH', 'Xu B']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3370-0164', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7998-9963', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5451-5219']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510515, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, 361003, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', ""The First People's Hospital of Foshan (The Affiliated Foshan Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University), 528000, Foshan, Guangdong, China."", 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, 361102, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, 361003, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, 361003, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, 361003, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, 361102, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, 361003, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, 361003, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Hematopathology Division and Department of Pathology, Duke University School of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center and Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, 361102, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, 361102, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Precision Medicine, Cancer Center, the First Hospital of Jilin University, 130021, Changchun, Jilin, China. daiyun@jlu.edu.cn.', 'Hematopathology Division and Department of Pathology, Duke University School of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center and Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, 27710, USA. kenhyoung@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510515, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. xubingzhangjian@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, 361003, Xiamen, Fujian, China. xubingzhangjian@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200918,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '87CIC980Y0', '(N-(2-amino-5-fluorobenzyl)-4-(N-(pyridine-3-acrylyl)aminomethyl)benzamide)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",PMC7501858,,,2020/09/20 06:00,2021/05/14 06:00,['2020/09/19 05:29'],"['2020/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/19 05:29 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-02972-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-02972-2 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Sep 18;11(9):778. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-02972-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This doesn't allow sufficient training of ML classifiers that could be used for improving molecular diagnostics. METHODS: We reviewed published datasets of high throughput gene expression profiles corresponding to cancer patients with known responses on chemotherapy treatments. We browsed Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Tumor Alterations Relevant for GEnomics-driven Therapy (TARGET) repositories. RESULTS: We identified data collections suitable to build ML models for predicting responses on certain chemotherapeutic schemes. We identified 26 datasets, ranging from 41 till 508 cases per dataset. All the datasets identified were checked for ML applicability and robustness with leave-one-out cross validation. Twenty-three datasets were found suitable for using ML that had balanced numbers of treatment responder and non-responder cases. CONCLUSIONS: We collected a database of gene expression profiles associated with clinical responses on chemotherapy for 2786 individual cancer cases. Among them seven datasets included RNA sequencing data (for 645 cases) and the others - microarray expression profiles. The cases represented breast cancer, lung cancer, low-grade glioma, endothelial carcinoma, multiple myeloma, adult leukemia, pediatric leukemia and kidney tumors. Chemotherapeutics included taxanes, bortezomib, vincristine, trastuzumab, letrozole, tipifarnib, temozolomide, busulfan and cyclophosphamide.","['Borisov, Nicolas', 'Sorokin, Maxim', 'Tkachev, Victor', 'Garazha, Andrew', 'Buzdin, Anton']","['Borisov N', 'Sorokin M', 'Tkachev V', 'Garazha A', 'Buzdin A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1671-5524'],"['Department of Bioinformatics and Molecular Networks, OmicsWay Corporation, Walnut, CA, 91788, USA. borisov@oncobox.com.', 'Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Dolgoprudny, Moscow Oblast, 141701, Russia. borisov@oncobox.com.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Molecular Networks, OmicsWay Corporation, Walnut, CA, 91788, USA.', 'I.M.

In the clinical setting, chemotherapy including anthracyclines and Ara-C remains a gold standard for AML treatment. In the last decade, etoposide (Eto) and fludarabine (Flu) have been added to the standard treatment for AML to potentiate its therapeutic effect and have been tested in many trials. Very little data are available about the ability of these drugs to induce ICD. METHODS: AML cells were treated with all four drugs. Calreticulin and heat shock protein 70/90 translocation, non-histone chromatin-binding protein high mobility group box 1 and adenosine triphosphate release were evaluated. The treated cells were pulsed into dendritic cells (DCs) and used for in vitro immunological tests. RESULTS: Flu and Ara-C had no capacity to induce ICD-related events. Interestingly, Eto was comparable to DNR in inducing all ICD events, resulting in DC maturation. Moreover, Flu was significantly more potent in inducing suppressive T regulatory cells compared to other drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a novel and until now poorly investigated feature of antineoplastic drugs commonly used for AML treatment, based on their different immunogenic potential.","['Ocadlikova, Darina', 'Iannarone, Clara', 'Redavid, Anna Rita', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Curti, Antonio']","['Ocadlikova D', 'Iannarone C', 'Redavid AR', 'Cavo M', 'Curti A']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6618-6694', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1332-2792']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica, Diagnostica e Sperimentale, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Universita degli Studi, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, via Albertoni 15, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica, Diagnostica e Sperimentale, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Universita degli Studi, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica, Diagnostica e Sperimentale, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Universita degli Studi, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Specialistica, Diagnostica e Sperimentale, Istituto di Ematologia ""Seragnoli"", Universita degli Studi, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, via Albertoni 15, 40138 Bologna, Italy.', 'Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, via Albertoni 15, 40138 Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200916,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Alarmins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Alarmins/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Calreticulin/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Extracellular Space', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunogenic Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Organelles/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics']",PMC7556041,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'etoposide', 'fludarabine', 'immunogenic cell death']",2020/09/20 06:00,2021/02/27 06:00,['2020/09/19 01:02'],"['2020/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/19 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21186802 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21186802 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Sep 16;21(18). pii: ijms21186802. doi: 10.3390/ijms21186802.,,"['2017 IG20654/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', 'Bologna section/Associazione Italiana Contro le Leucemie-Linfomi e Mieloma', 'Foundation Corrado and Bruno Maria Zaini-Bologna/Foundation Corrado and Bruno', 'Maria Zaini-Bologna']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of gene regulation studies have been biased towards reactive oxygen species (ROS) among the physicochemical components of CAP. The current study aimed to systemically determine the distribution of target genes regulated by the ROS and non-ROS constituents of CAP. Genome-wide expression data from a public database, which were obtained after treating U937 leukemia and SK-mel-147 melanoma cells with CAP or H2O2, were analyzed, and gene sets regulated by either or both of them were identified. The results showed 252 and 762 genes in H2O2-treated U937 and SK-mel-147 cells, respectively, and 112 and 843 genes in CAP-treated U937 and SK-mel-147 cells, respectively, with expression changes higher than two-fold. Notably, only four and two genes were regulated by H2O2 and CAP in common, respectively, indicating that non-ROS constituents were responsible for the regulation of the majority of CAP-regulated genes. Experiments using ROS and nitrogen oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors demonstrated the ROS- and reactive nitrogen species (RNS)-independent regulation of PTGER3 and HSPA6 when U937 cancer cells were treated with CAP. Taken together, this study identified CAP-specific genes regulated by constituents other than ROS or RNS and could contribute to the annotation of the target genes of specific constituents in CAP.","['Ji, Hwee Won', 'Kim, Heejoo', 'Kim, Hyeon Woo', 'Yun, Sung Hwan', 'Park, Jae Eun', 'Choi, Eun Ha', 'Kim, Sun Jung']","['Ji HW', 'Kim H', 'Kim HW', 'Yun SH', 'Park JE', 'Choi EH', 'Kim SJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8951-6008', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5385-1878', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6818-3956']","['Department of Life Science, Dongguk University-Seoul, Goyang 10326, Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, Dongguk University-Seoul, Goyang 10326, Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, Dongguk University-Seoul, Goyang 10326, Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, Dongguk University-Seoul, Goyang 10326, Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, Dongguk University-Seoul, Goyang 10326, Korea.', 'Plasma Bioscience Research Center, Kwangwoon University, Seoul 01897, Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, Dongguk University-Seoul, Goyang 10326, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200916,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7565996,['NOTNLM'],"['KEGG pathway', 'cold atmospheric plasma', 'leukemia cancer cells', 'reactive oxygen species', 'skin cancer cells']",2020/09/20 06:00,2020/09/20 06:01,['2020/09/19 01:02'],"['2020/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/19 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/20 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12092640 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12092640 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Sep 16;12(9). pii: cancers12092640. doi: 10.3390/cancers12092640.,,"['NRF-2016K1A4A3914113; NRF-2016R1D1A1B01009235/National Research Foundation of', 'Korea']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It further develops the apoptotic effects over the intrinsic pathway. An activation of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 can be detected by western blot analysis. The independence of CD95 is shown by similar apoptotic inductions in BJAB and BJAB FADDdn cells.

Upfront detection of therapy-resistant leukemia clones at diagnosis may allow adaptation of treatment and prevention of relapse, but this is hampered by a paucity of methods to identify and trace single leukemia-propagating cells and their clonal offspring. Here, we tested methods of cellular barcoding analysis, to trace the in vivo competitive dynamics of hundreds of patient-derived leukemia clones upon chemotherapy-mediated selective pressure. We transplanted Nod/Scid/Il2Rgamma(-/-) (NSG) mice with barcoded patient-derived or SupB15 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells and assessed clonal responses to dexamethasone, methotrexate, and vincristine, longitudinally and across nine anatomic locations. We illustrate that chemotherapy reduces clonal diversity in a drug-dependent manner. At end-stage disease, methotrexate-treated patient-derived xenografts had significantly fewer clones compared with placebo-treated mice (100 +/- 10 vs. 160 +/- 15 clones, p=0.0005), while clonal complexity in vincristine- and dexamethasone-treated xenografts was unaffected (115 +/- 33 and 150 +/- 7 clones, p=NS). Using tools developed to assess differential gene expression, we determined whether these clonal patterns resulted from random clonal drift or selection. We identified 5 clones that were reproducibly enriched in methotrexate-treated patient-derived xenografts, suggestive of pre-existent resistance. Finally, we found that chemotherapy-mediated selection resulted in a more asymmetric distribution of leukemia clones across anatomic sites. We found that cellular barcoding is a powerful method to trace the clonal dynamics of human patient-derived leukemia cells in response to chemotherapy. In the future, integration of cellular barcoding with single-cell sequencing technology may allow in-depth characterization of therapy-resistant leukemia clones and identify novel targets to prevent relapse.","['Jacobs, Sabrina', 'Ausema, Albertina', 'Zwart, Erik', 'Weersing, Ellen', 'de Haan, Gerald', 'Bystrykh, Leonid V', 'Belderbos, Mirjam E']","['Jacobs S', 'Ausema A', 'Zwart E', 'Weersing E', 'de Haan G', 'Bystrykh LV', 'Belderbos ME']",,"['Department of Ageing Biology and Stem Cells, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Ageing Biology and Stem Cells, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Ageing Biology and Stem Cells, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Ageing Biology and Stem Cells, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Ageing Biology and Stem Cells, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Ageing Biology and Stem Cells, European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Oncode Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

If this is the case, we hypothesized that human pediatric B-ALLs would share gene expression patterns with mouse B-1 or B-2 progenitors. We tested this premise by deriving a distinct 30-gene B-1 and B-2 progenitor signature that was applied to a microarray data set of human pediatric ALLs. Cluster analysis revealed that CRLF2, E2A-PBX1, ERG, and ETV6-RUNX1 leukemias were B-1-like, whereas BCR-ABL1, hyperdiploid, and MLL leukemias were B-2-like. Examination of the 30-gene signature in two independent data sets of pediatric ALLs supported this result. Our data suggest that common genetic subtypes of human ALL have their origin in the B-1 or B-2 lineage.","['Fitch, Briana', 'Roy, Ritu', 'Geng, Huimin', 'Montecino-Rodriguez, Encarnacion', 'Bengtsson, Henrik', 'Gaillard, Coline', 'Hiam, Kamir', 'Casero, David', 'Olshen, Adam B', 'Dorshkind, Kenneth', 'Kogan, Scott C']","['Fitch B', 'Roy R', 'Geng H', 'Montecino-Rodriguez E', 'Bengtsson H', 'Gaillard C', 'Hiam K', 'Casero D', 'Olshen AB', 'Dorshkind K', 'Kogan SC']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; Computational Biology and Informatics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; Computational Biology and Informatics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA; Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.

Regulatory role of an epigenetic reader lens epithelium-derived growth factor/p75 (LEDGF/p75) requires at least two copies of this protein to overcome the nucleosome-induced barrier to transcription elongation. Moreover, various LEDGF/p75 binding partners are enriched for dimeric features, further underscoring the functional regulatory role of LEDGF/p75 dimerization. Here, we dissected the minimal dimerization region in the C-terminal part of LEDGF/p75 and, using paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy, identified the key molecular contacts that helped to refine the solution structure of the dimer. The LEDGF/p75 dimeric assembly is stabilized by domain swapping within the integrase binding domain and additional electrostatic ""stapling"" of the negatively charged alpha helix formed in the intrinsically disordered C-terminal region. We validated the dimerization mechanism using structure-inspired dimerization defective LEDGF/p75 variants and chemical crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry.

Isavuconazole is a newer broad-spectrum antifungal agent with promising efficacy and safety. However, there remains limited data to favor its use over current first-line agents. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate isavuconazole use and describe rates of associated breakthrough invasive fungal disease (bIFD). METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study was conducted to evaluate patients receiving isavuconazole for prophylaxis or treatment of IFD between July 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018. Patient-related and outcomes data were extracted from electronic medical records. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze our findings. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients received 61 isavuconazole courses. Isavuconazole was most commonly prescribed for primary prophylaxis in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) population along with treatment for possible invasive fungal disease. The primary reasons for choosing isavuconazole included QTc shortening effects, decreased risk of acute kidney injury, broader spectrum of activity, and concern for breakthrough invasive fungal disease on a different prophylactic agent. We found a breakthrough rate of 8.5% for patients and 7.8% for courses. CONCLUSIONS: Isavuconazole appears to be a promising alternative for prophylaxis and treatment of invasive fungal disease. We observed similar bIFD rates and improved tolerability when compared to historical data for posaconazole and voriconazole.","['Vu, Christine A', 'Rana, Meenakshi M', 'Jacobs, Samantha E', 'Saunders-Hao, Patricia']","['Vu CA', 'Rana MM', 'Jacobs SE', 'Saunders-Hao P']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0162-5101', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9770-886X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3518-1409']","['Department of Pharmacy, Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20201104,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '60UTO373KE (isavuconazole)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Invasive Fungal Infections/drug therapy', 'Nitriles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['antifungal', 'invasive fungal disease', 'isavuconazole', 'prophylaxis']",2020/09/19 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2020/09/18 17:13'],"['2020/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/18 17:13 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tid.13469 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2021 Apr;23(2):e13469. doi: 10.1111/tid.13469.

Despite this clinical response, patients were not cured. In parallel, we demonstrated a marked improvement in the in vivo efficacy of CX-5461 in combination with PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway inhibitors. Here, we reveal the molecular basis for this improved efficacy observed in vivo, which is associated with specific suppression of translation of mRNAs encoding regulators of cellular metabolism. Importantly, acquired resistance to this cotreatment is driven by translational rewiring that results in dysregulated cellular metabolism and induction of a cAMP-dependent pathway critical for the survival of blood cancers including lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia. Our studies thus identify key molecular mechanisms underpinning the response of blood cancers to selective inhibition of ribosome biogenesis and define metabolic vulnerabilities that will facilitate the rational design of more effective regimens for Pol I-directed therapies.","['Kusnadi, Eric P', 'Trigos, Anna S', 'Cullinane, Carleen', 'Goode, David L', 'Larsson, Ola', 'Devlin, Jennifer R',

The present study aimed to determine whether RAD52induced regulation of repair bypass occurs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and to explore the underlying mechanism. Herein, we applied an RAD52 aptamer to AML cells with downregulated BRCA1/2. RAD52 aptamer inhibited AML cell proliferation detected by cell counting, promoted cell apoptosis obtained by flow cytometry, and suppressed DNA damage repair behavior measured by comet assay and flow cytometry, after drug intervention during low expression of BRCA1/2. During this process, DDRrelated cell cycle checkpoint proteins were activated, and the cells were continuously arrested in the S/G2 phase, which affected the cell damage repair process. Concurrently, the expression levels of apoptosisrelated proteins were also altered. Furthermore, the expression of STAT3 and pSTAT3 was downregulated by the RAD52 aptamer, suggesting that RAD52 affects the STAT3 signaling pathway. In summary, we present a possible role for RAD52 in DDR of BRCA1/2deficient AML cells that involves the STAT3 signaling pathway.","['Xu, Yichuan', 'Lin, Yansi', 'Luo, Yuxuan', 'Yang, Yanling', 'Long, Bing', 'Fang, Zhigang', 'Liu, Lingling', 'Zhang, Jingwen', 'Zhang, Xiangzhong']","['Xu Y', 'Lin Y', 'Luo Y', 'Yang Y', 'Long B', 'Fang Z', 'Liu L', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang X']",,"['Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yatsen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510630, P.R.

However, the potential therapeutic role and mechanisms of GA in Tcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (TALL) remain unclear. In the present study, the effects of GA on proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy in TALL cell lines were investigated. The possible mechanisms underlying GA activity were also examined. The results showed that GA inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis, and activated autophagy in TALL cell lines (Jurkat and Molt4 cells). Findings confirmed that GA has an antileukemia effect against peripheral blood lymphocyte cells in patients with ALL. GA inhibited phosphoGSK3beta S9 (pGSK3beta S9) protein levels to inactivate Wnt signaling and suppress betacatenin protein levels. In addition, the inhibitory effect of GA on TALL was reversed by overexpression of betacatenin. Thus, GA can inhibit the growth and survival of TALL cells. GA also had antileukemic activity, at least in part, through the downregulation of the Wnt/betacatenin signaling pathway.","['Wang, Tongtong', 'Du, Jing', 'Kong, Dexia', 'Yang, Guosheng', 'Zhou, Qihao', 'You, Fei', 'Lin, Yan', 'Wang, Ying']","['Wang T', 'Du J', 'Kong D', 'Yang G', 'Zhou Q', 'You F', 'Lin Y', 'Wang Y']",,"[""Department of General Practice, Wangjiangshan Institute, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, P.R.

CD9, which belongs to the tetraspanin membrane proteins, is implicated in several pathological processes, including tumor progression. However, the role of CD9 in the pathogenesis of Ph+ ALL and the potential benefit of applying CD9targeted RNA interference strategies for treatment of Ph+ ALL require further investigation. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of CD9 on leukemic cell progression and the efficacy of therapeutic agents in Ph+ ALL cells, in addition to assessing the in vitro antileukemia activity of CD9targeted RNA interference in Ph+ ALL cells.

In addition, CD9 knockdown could suppress cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion, and promote apoptosis and the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs (such as vincristine, daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in SUPB15 cells. Furthermore, CD9 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in SUPB15 cells via a p53dependent pathway. These findings suggested that gene silencing of CD9 using a shRNAexpressing lentivirus vector may provide a promising treatment for Ph+ ALL.","['Xing, Chongyun', 'Xu, Wanling', 'Shi, Yifen', 'Zhou, Bin', 'Wu, Dijiong', 'Liang, Bin', 'Zhou, Yuhong', 'Gao, Shenmeng', 'Feng, Jianhua']","['Xing C', 'Xu W', 'Shi Y', 'Zhou B', 'Wu D', 'Liang B', 'Zhou Y', 'Gao S', 'Feng J']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310006, P.R.

They are also effective against solid cancers, such as breast cancer. The present study demonstrated that meninMLL inhibitors, such as MI463, unexpectedly induced the ferroptotic cell death of several cancer cell lines. MI463 at a doubledigit nM concentration markedly decreased the viable number of OVCAR8 ovarian cancer cells for 3 days. Ferrostatin1 (a ferroptosis inhibitor) almost completely abrogated the MI463induced decrease in viable cell numbers. Furthermore, the cancer cellkilling activity was inhibited by Nacetylcysteine [a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS)], deferoxamine (DFO, an iron chelator), PD146176 (a specific inhibitor of arachidonate 15lipoxygenase), idebenone (a membranepermeable analog of CoQ10) and oleic acid [a monounsaturated fatty acid and one of the end products of stearoylCoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)], whereas ZVADFMK (an apoptosis inhibitor) had a negligible effect on cell death. It was also found that MI463 in combination with auranofin (a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor) synergistically increased cancer the death of breast, ovarian, pancreatic and lung cancer cell lines (88%, 14/16 cell lines). The synergistic induction of cell death was abrogated by ferroptosis inhibitor and DFO. Inhibitors of SCD1, similar to MI463, also enhanced cancer cell death synergistically with auranofin, while inhibitors of SCD1 and MI463 did not additively induce cell death. Treatment with zinc protoporphyrin9, a specific inhibitor of heme oxygenase1 (HO1), markedly attenuated the cell death induced by MI463 plus auranofin. On the whole, these results suggest that the MI463induced decrease in cell viability may be at least partly associated with the inhibition of SCD1 activity. In addition, the potent induction of HO1 contributed to the synergistic effects of MI463 plus auranofin. Therefore, meninMLL inhibitors, such as MI463, in combination with auranofin represent an effective therapeutic approach for several types of cancer via the induction of ferroptosis.","['Kato, Ichiroh', 'Kasukabe, Takashi', 'Kumakura, Shunichi']","['Kato I', 'Kasukabe T', 'Kumakura S']",,"['Department of Medical Education and Research, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo, Shimane 6938501, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo, Shimane 6938501, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo, Shimane 6938501, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200828,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '3H04W2810V (Auranofin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antirheumatic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Auranofin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Ferroptosis/*drug effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*menin-MLL inhibitor', '*MI-463', '*MI-503', '*MI-2-2', '*auranofin', '*ferroptosis', '*ovarian cancer cells', '*breast cancer cells', '*pancreatic cancer cells']",2020/09/19 06:00,2021/07/15 06:00,['2020/09/18 08:43'],"['2020/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/18 08:43 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2020.5116 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2020 Oct;57(4):1057-1071. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2020.5116.

In the present study, the effects of miR130a on the sensitivity of AML cells to Adriamycin (Adr) were investigated. 5Aza2'deoxycytidine (5AzadC) was used to stimulate Adr resistance in AML cells, and cell viability and miR130a expression were determined using the Cell Counting Kit8 (CCK8) assay and reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR, respectively. miR130a overexpression and knockdown in Adrresistant AML cells was performed to investigate the proliferative and invasive abilities of the cells using CCK8 and Transwell assays, respectively. Furthermore, the effects of miR130a on the expression of epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT)related proteins in Adrresistant AML cells were detected using western blot analysis. Pretreatment with 5AzadC enhanced the cell viability and miR130a expression of Adrtreated AML cells. Adr and miR130a expression showed a dosedependent relationship, with miR130a expression decreasing with increasing Adr concentrations. Moreover, miR130a overexpression alleviated the inhibitory effects of Adr on cell viability and invasion, while miR130a knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of AML cells to Adr. Furthermore, Adr exerted an inhibitory effect on EMT in AML cells, which was rescued by miR130a overexpression and enhanced by miR130a knockdown. miR130a knockdown also increased the sensitivity of AML cells to Adr by decreasing cell viability, invasion and EMT. Therefore, miR130a knockdown is a potential therapeutic strategy for Adrresistant AML.","['Liu, Huimin', 'Liu, Min', 'Zhang, Jiangzhao', 'Liang, Yan']","['Liu H', 'Liu M', 'Zhang J', 'Liang Y']",,"['Department of Hematology, Jingzhou Central Hospital, Jingzhou, Hubei 434020, P.R.

However, the effect of low CREBBP expression on the prognosis of ALL has not yet been investigated. In the present study, CREBBP was downregulated and overexpressed in ALL cell lines (Jurkat and Reh). Sensitivity to chemotherapy and cell proliferation activity was determined via a Cell Counting Kit8 assay. Cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) assays were performed to determine the interaction between CREBBP and E2F transcription factor 3a (E2F3a). The binding of CREBBP to downstream gene caspase 8 associated protein 2 (CASP8AP2) promoters was assessed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and mRNA expression levels were detected via reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR. Western blot analysis was performed to detect protein expression of CREBBP, E2F3a and CASP8AP2. Downregulation of CREBBP increased the IC50 value of daunorubicin; however, no significant affects were observed on the IC50 values of vincristine and Lasparaginase. Furthermore, downregulation of CREBBP notably inhibited leukemia cell proliferation, accumulated cells in the G0/G1 phase and decreased cell proportions in the S and G2/M phases. CoIP analysis demonstrated that CREBBP interacted with E2F3a, a transcription factor involved in G1/S transition. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy indicated colocalization of CREBBP and E2F3a at the cell nucleus. Furthermore, E2F3a protein expression decreased in CREBBP RNA interference treated Jurkat and Reh cells. CASP8AP2, a target gene of E2F3a, was also identified to be a downstream gene of CREBBP. In addition, decreased IC50 value and cell proportions in the G0/G1 phase, accelerated cell proliferation and upregulated E2F3a and CASP8AP2 expression were exhibited in CREBBP overexpressed cells. Taken together, the results of the present study suggested that CREBBP downregulation affects proliferation and cell cycle progression in leukemia cells, potentially via the interaction and regulation of E2F3a, resulting in chemotherapy resistance. Thus, targeting CREBBP may be a therapeutic strategy for treating pediatric patients with ALL.","['Gao, Chao', 'Liu, Shu-Guang', 'Lu, Wen-Ting', 'Yue, Zhi-Xia', 'Zhao, Xiao-Xi', 'Xing, Tian-Yu', 'Chen, Zhen-Ping', 'Zheng, Hu-Yong', 'Li, Zhi-Gang']","['Gao C', 'Liu SG', 'Lu WT', 'Yue ZX', 'Zhao XX', 'Xing TY', 'Chen ZP', 'Zheng HY', 'Li ZG']",,"['Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics (Capital Medical University), Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing 100045, P.R.

However, the positive percentage of Mcl1 in the noncancerous lung tissues was lower compared with NSCLC. In addition, NCAPH highexpression patients had a higher overall survival rate compared with patients exhibiting low expression, whereas the Mcl1 highexpression group had a lower survival rate. Pairwise association in 260 cases of NSCLC revealed that overexpression of the NCAPH protein was negatively associated with Mcl1 expression and vice versa.

Less is known about its value before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in patients transplanted with active disease, either relapsed or primary refractory (Rel-Ref) AML. We explored the impact of cytogenetic risk (stratification according to MRC-UK) in 2089 patients with either Ref (n = 972) or Rel AML (n = 1117) transplanted during the period 2000-2017. Overall, 154 patients had a favorable risk, 1283 had an intermediate risk and 652 had an adverse cytogenetic risk. Median follow-up was 49 months. Compared to the favorable risk group, intermediate and adverse risk patients were associated with worse leukemia-free survival and OS and also with a higher incidence of relapse. In a subgroup analysis of patients in the intermediate risk group harboring Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), this remained an important prognostic factor, being associated with worse outcomes. When analyzing patients according to the intensity of the conditioning regimen, no differences were observed for the main transplant outcomes. In conclusion, in patients diagnosed with AML and transplanted with active disease, karyotype remains an important prognostic factor, allowing splitting patients into different risk groups according to their cytogenetics. Similarly, FLT3-ITD mutation also remains a negative prognostic factor in this population.","['Poiani, Monica', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Battipaglia, Giorgia', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Brecht, Arne', 'Forcade, Edouard', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Passweg, Jakob R', 'Labussiere-Wallet, Helene', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Schafer-Eckart, Kerstin', 'Kroeger, Nicolaus', 'Guffroy, Blandine', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Poiani M', 'Labopin M', 'Battipaglia G', 'Beelen DW', 'Tischer J', 'Finke J', 'Brecht A', 'Forcade E', 'Ganser A', 'Passweg JR', 'Labussiere-Wallet H', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Schafer-Eckart K', 'Kroeger N', 'Guffroy B', 'Ruggeri A', 'Esteve J', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0695-3879', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7261-2765']","[""Hematology Department, Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France."", 'Clinica di Ematologia, AOU Ospedali Riuniti, Ancona, Italy.', ""Hematology Department, Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France."", 'Sorbonne Universites, UPMC Univ Paris 06, INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Paris, France.', 'EBMT Paris study office, Paris, France.', ""Hematology Department, Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France."", 'Federico II University, Hematology Department, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'University Hospital of Munich-LMU, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Deutsche Klinik fuer Diagnostik, KMT Zentrum, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'CHU Bordeaux, Hopital Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Hematology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Hopital Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France.', 'CHU de Lille, LIRIC, INSERM U995, Universite de Lille, Lille, France.', 'Klinikum Nuernberg, Medizinische Klinik, BMT-Unit, Nuernberg, Germany.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Hematology, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, France.', 'Ospedale San Raffaele s.r.l., Haematology and BMT, Milan, Italy.', 'Hospital Clinic, Dept. of Hematology, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'EBMT Paris study office, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Division and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', ""Hematology Department, Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Paris, France."", 'Sorbonne Universites, UPMC Univ Paris 06, INSERM, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine (CRSA), Paris, France.', 'EBMT Paris study office, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20201008,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,,2020/09/19 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2020/09/18 05:54'],"['2020/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/18 05:54 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.26000 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2021 Jan;96(1):40-50. doi: 10.1002/ajh.26000.

Myelodysplastic syndromes arising in older subjects are influenced by combinations of acquired somatic genetic lesions driving evolution from clonal haematopoiesis to myelodysplastic syndromes and from myelodysplastic syndromes to acute leukaemia. A different pattern of mutations has been identified in a small subset of myelodysplastic syndromes arising in young patients with familial syndromes. In particular, dysregulation of ANKRD26, RUNX1 and ETV6 genes plays a role in familial thrombocytopenia with predisposition to myelodysplastic syndromes and acute leukaemia. Whether these genes affect thrombopoiesis in sporadic myelodysplastic syndrome with thrombocytopenia is still undefined. Thirty-one myelodysplastic syndromes subjects and 27 controls subjects were investigated. Genomic DNA was used for mutation screening (ETV6, RUNX1, 5'UTR ANKRD26 genes). Functional studies were performed in the MEG-01-akaryoblastic cell line. We found four novel variants of RUNX1 gene, all in elderly myelodysplastic syndromes subjects with thrombocytopenia. Functional studies of the variant p.Pro103Arg showed no changes in RUNX1 expression, but the variant was associated with deregulated high transcriptional activity of ANKRD26 in MEG-01 cells. RUNX1 variant p.Pro103Arg was also associated with increased viability and reduced apoptosis of MEG-01, as well as impaired platelet production. Our findings are consistent with dysregulation of ANKRD26 in RUNX1 haploinsufficiency. Lack of repression of ANKRD26 expression may contribute to thrombocytopenia of subjects with sporadic myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Ferrari, Silvia', 'Regazzo, Daniela', 'Omenetto, Elisabetta', 'Scaroni, Carla', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Fabris, Fabrizio', 'Vianello, Fabrizio']","['Ferrari S', 'Regazzo D', 'Omenetto E', 'Scaroni C', 'Semenzato G', 'Fabris F', 'Vianello F']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7174-4651'],"['Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine DIMED, Padova University Hospital, Padua, Italy.', 'Endocrinology Unit, Department of Medicine DIMED, Padova University Hospital, Padua, Italy.', 'Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine DIMED, Padova University Hospital, Padua, Italy.', 'Endocrinology Unit, Department of Medicine DIMED, Padova University Hospital, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine DIMED, Padova University Hospital, Padua, Italy.', 'Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine DIMED, Padova University Hospital, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine DIMED, Padova University Hospital, Padua, Italy. fabrizio.vianello@unipd.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200917,Germany,Aging Clin Exp Res,Aging clinical and experimental research,101132995,"['0 (ANKRD26 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Anemia', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mutation', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', '*Thrombocytopenia']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ANKRD26', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Platelets', 'RUNX1', 'Thrombocytopenia']",2020/09/19 06:00,2021/07/06 06:00,['2020/09/18 05:53'],"['2020/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/18 05:53 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40520-020-01709-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s40520-020-01709-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Aging Clin Exp Res. 2021 Jul;33(7):1987-1992. doi: 10.1007/s40520-020-01709-7.

The 5-year overall survival (OS) of patients with AML is less than 30%, highlighting the urgent need to identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we analyze gene expression datasets for genes that are differentially overexpressed in AML cells compared with healthy hematopoietic cells. We report that apolipoprotein C2 (APOC2) mRNA is significantly overexpressed in AML, particularly in patients with mixed-lineage leukemia rearrangements. By multivariate analysis, high APOC2 expression in leukemia blasts is significantly associated with decreased OS (HR: 2.51; 95% CI, 1.03-6.07; P = 0.04). APOC2 is a small secreted apolipoprotein that constitutes chylomicrons, very-low-density lipoproteins, and high-density lipoproteins with other apolipoproteins. APOC2 activates lipoprotein lipase and contributes to lipid metabolism. By gain and loss of function approaches in cultured AML cells, we demonstrate that APOC2 promotes leukemia growth via CD36-mediated LYN-ERK signaling activation. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of either APOC2 or CD36 reduces cell proliferation, induces apoptosis in vitro, and delays leukemia progression in mice. Altogether, this study establishes APOC2-CD36 axis as a potential therapeutic target in AML.","['Zhang, Tian', 'Yang, Jiawen', 'Vaikari, Vijaya P', 'Beckford, John S', 'Wu, Sharon', 'Akhtari, Mojtaba', 'Alachkar, Houda']","['Zhang T', 'Yang J', 'Vaikari VP', 'Beckford JS', 'Wu S', 'Akhtari M', 'Alachkar H']",,"['Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Titus Family Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Titus Family Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Titus Family Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Titus Family Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Loma Linda University Cancer Center, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California.', 'USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Titus Family Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California. alachkar@usc.edu.', 'USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Cancer Discov,Blood cancer discovery,101764786,,,,PMC7494214,,,2020/09/19 06:00,2020/09/19 06:01,['2020/09/18 05:52'],"['2020/09/18 05:52 [entrez]', '2020/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-19-0077 [doi]', '2643-3230.BCD-19-0077 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cancer Discov. 2020 Sep;1(2):198-213. doi: 10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-19-0077.,,"['P30 CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001855/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest No potential conflicts of interest', 'were disclosed.']",['NIHMS1625259'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We established inducible transgene expression in clinically relevant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in vivo to fill this gap. Results: With this technique at hand, we analyzed the role of the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) PDX models at different disease stages. In competitive preclinical in vivo trials, we found that re-expression of wild type KLF4 reduced the leukemia load in PDX models of B-ALL, with the strongest effects being observed after conventional chemotherapy in minimal residual disease (MRD). A nonfunctional KLF4 mutant had no effect on this model. The re-expression of KLF4 sensitized tumor cells in the PDX model towards systemic chemotherapy in vivo. It is of major translational relevance that azacitidine upregulated KLF4 levels in the PDX model and a KLF4 knockout reduced azacitidine-induced cell death, suggesting that azacitidine can regulate KLF4 re-expression. These results support the application of azacitidine in patients with B-ALL as a therapeutic option to regulate KLF4. Conclusion: Genetic engineering of PDX models allows the examination of the function of dysregulated genes like KLF4 in a highly clinically relevant translational context, and it also enables the selection of therapeutic targets in individual tumors and links their functions to clinically available drugs, which will facilitate personalized treatment in the future.","['Liu, Wen-Hsin', 'Mrozek-Gorska, Paulina', 'Wirth, Anna-Katharina', 'Herold, Tobias', 'Schwarzkopf, Larissa', 'Pich, Dagmar', 'Volse, Kerstin', 'Melo-Narvaez, M Camila', 'Carlet, Michela', 'Hammerschmidt, Wolfgang', 'Jeremias, Irmela']","['Liu WH', 'Mrozek-Gorska P', 'Wirth AK', 'Herold T', 'Schwarzkopf L', 'Pich D', 'Volse K', 'Melo-Narvaez MC', 'Carlet M', 'Hammerschmidt W', 'Jeremias I']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1773-7677'],"['Research Unit Apoptosis in Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377 Munich, Germany.grid.4567.00000 0004 0483 2525', 'Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), Munich, Germany.grid.4567.00000 0004 0483 2525', 'Research Unit Apoptosis in Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377 Munich, Germany.grid.4567.00000 0004 0483 2525', 'Research Unit Apoptosis in Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377 Munich, Germany.grid.4567.00000 0004 0483 2525', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.grid.411095.80000 0004 0477 2585', 'Research Unit Apoptosis in Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377 Munich, Germany.grid.4567.00000 0004 0483 2525', 'Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), Munich, Germany.grid.4567.00000 0004 0483 2525', 'Research Unit Apoptosis in Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377 Munich, Germany.grid.4567.00000 0004 0483 2525', 'Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), Munich, Germany.grid.4567.00000 0004 0483 2525', 'Research Unit Apoptosis in Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377 Munich, Germany.grid.4567.00000 0004 0483 2525', 'Research Unit Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), Munich, Germany.grid.4567.00000 0004 0483 2525', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Partner Site Munich, Munich, Germany.grid.452463.2', 'Research Unit Apoptosis in Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), Marchioninistrasse 25, 81377 Munich, Germany.grid.4567.00000 0004 0483 2525', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, Munich, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich, Germany.grid.5252.00000 0004 1936 973X""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200916,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,,PMC7493381,['NOTNLM'],"['Azacitidine', 'Inducible transgene expression', 'KLF4', 'PDX models of acute leukemia']",2020/09/19 06:00,2020/09/19 06:01,['2020/09/18 05:50'],"['2020/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/18 05:50 [entrez]', '2020/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-020-00226-z [doi]', '226 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2020 Sep 16;8:46. doi: 10.1186/s40364-020-00226-z. eCollection 2020.,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are known to play a significant role in leukaemia drug resistance by delivery of anti-apoptotic proteins and genes conferring resistance to recipient cells. sEV levels are elevated in AML patients' plasma at the time of diagnosis and remain elevated in complete remission after chemotherapy. The mechanism of enhanced sEV secretion in AML is unknown. We speculated that cholesterol synthesis by AML blasts may be related to elevated sEV secretion. Intracellular levels of cholesterol and of HMGCR (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesizing mevalonate pathway, significantly increased in cultured AML cells or primary human non-malignant cells treated with cytarabine or decitabine. Concomitantly, levels of sEVs produced by these cells also increased. Treatment with an HMGCR inhibitor, Simvastatin, or siRNAs targeting HMGCR blocked the chemotherapy-induced enhancement of sEV secretion in AML cells. sEVs carry HMGCR and chemotherapy enhances HMGCR levels in sEVs. HMGCR(+) sEVs upregulate intracellular cholesterol and promote AML cell proliferation. A pharmacologic blockade of HMGCR emerges as a potential future therapeutic option for disrupting sEV signalling leading to cholesterol-driven chemo-resistance in AML.","['Hong, Chang-Sook', 'Jeong, Emily', 'Boyiadzis, Michael', 'Whiteside, Theresa L']","['Hong CS', 'Jeong E', 'Boyiadzis M', 'Whiteside TL']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7316-6181'],"['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Taylor Allderdice High School, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Departments of Immunology and Otolaryngology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200807,United States,J Extracell Vesicles,Journal of extracellular vesicles,101610479,,,,PMC7480590,['NOTNLM'],"['HMGCR', 'Leukaemia', 'chemotherapy', 'cholesterol', 'small extracellular vesicles']",2020/09/19 06:00,2020/09/19 06:01,['2020/09/18 05:50'],"['2020/09/18 05:50 [entrez]', '2020/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/20013078.2020.1800979 [doi]', '1800979 [pii]']",epublish,J Extracell Vesicles. 2020 Aug 7;9(1):1800979. doi: 10.1080/20013078.2020.1800979.,"['(c) 2020 The Author(s).

Invasive fungal infections are particularly relevant for patients who have received chemotherapy and for those who have HIV infection. In addition, changes in fungal microbiota are associated with the worsening of chronic conditions like atopic dermatitis (AD). This work aims, through a systematic review, to analyze the methods used in previous studies to identify oral fungi and their most frequent species in patients with the following conditions: HIV infection, leukemia, and atopic dermatitis. Methods: A literature search was performed on several different databases. Inclusion criteria were: written in English or Portuguese; published between September 2009 and September 2019; analyzed oral fungi of HIV-infected, leukemia, or AD patients. Results: 21 studies were included and the most identified species was Candida. The predominant methods of identification were morphological (13/21) and sugar fermentation and assimilation tests (11/21). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was the most used molecular method (8/21) followed by sequencing techniques (3/21). Conclusions: Although morphological and biochemical tests are still used, they are associated with high-throughput sequencing techniques, due to their accuracy and time saving for profiling the predominant species in oral mycobiome.","['Sodre, Camila Stofella', 'Rodrigues, Paulo Matheus Guerra', 'Vieira, Mayra Stambovsky', 'Marques Paes da Silva, Alexandre', 'Goncalves, Lucio Souza', 'Ribeiro, Marcia Goncalves', 'de Carvalho Ferreira, Dennis']","['Sodre CS', 'Rodrigues PMG', 'Vieira MS', 'Marques Paes da Silva A', 'Goncalves LS', 'Ribeiro MG', 'de Carvalho Ferreira D']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5520-2262'],"['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Medicine, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro - UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Oral and Systemic Infections, Faculty of Dentistry, Estacio de Sa University- UNESA, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Dentistry, Veiga de Almeida University- UVA, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Oral and Systemic Infections, Faculty of Dentistry, Estacio de Sa University- UNESA, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Oral and Systemic Infections, Faculty of Dentistry, Estacio de Sa University- UNESA, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Medical Genetics Service, Martagao Gesteira Pediatric Institute (IPPMG- UFRJ), Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro-UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Oral and Systemic Infections, Faculty of Dentistry, Estacio de Sa University- UNESA, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200817,United States,J Oral Microbiol,Journal of oral microbiology,101551049,,,,PMC7482892,['NOTNLM'],"['HIV', 'Mycobiome', 'atopic dermatitis.', 'fungi', 'leukemia']",2020/09/19 06:00,2020/09/19 06:01,['2020/09/18 05:50'],"['2020/09/18 05:50 [entrez]', '2020/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/20002297.2020.1807179 [doi]', '1807179 [pii]']",epublish,J Oral Microbiol. 2020 Aug 17;12(1):1807179. doi: 10.1080/20002297.2020.1807179.,"['(c) 2020 The Author(s).

Approximately 75% of B-ALL cases harbor recurrent abnormalities, including so-called complex karyotypes (CK). Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a metabolic abnormality which may arise during cancer therapy and also, extremely rarely, as spontaneous TLS before initiation of chemotherapy in patients with ALL. Case presentation: Here we report a 9-year-old male, diagnosed with a de novo pre-B-ALL according to the WHO classification. Cytogenetic, molecular cytogenetic approaches and array comparative genomic hybridization analyses revealed a unique CK involving five chromosomes. It included four yet unreported chromosomal aberrations: a der(11)t(7;11)(p22.1;q24.2), a der(18)t(7;18)(q21.3;p11.22), del(11)(q24.2q25) and dup(18)(q11.1q23). Unfortunately, the patient died 3 months after the initial diagnosis. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, a comparable childhood ALL case was not previously reported. Thus, the combination of the here seen chromosomal aberrations in childhood primary ALL seems to indicate for an extremely adverse prognosis.","['Wafa, Abdulsamad', 'Jarjour, Rami A', 'Alolabi, Doaa', 'Liehr, Thomas', 'Hamdan, Othman', 'Melo, Joana B', 'Carreira, Isabel M', 'Othman, Moneeb A K', 'Al-Achkar, Walid']","['Wafa A', 'Jarjour RA', 'Alolabi D', 'Liehr T', 'Hamdan O', 'Melo JB', 'Carreira IM', 'Othman MAK', 'Al-Achkar W']",,"['Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Human Genetics Division, Atomic Energy Commission, Damascus, Syria.grid.459405.90000 0000 9342 9009', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Human Genetics Division, Atomic Energy Commission, Damascus, Syria.grid.459405.90000 0000 9342 9009', 'Department of Hematology, Damascus Children University Hospital, Ministry of High Education, Damascus, Syria.', 'Jena University Hospital, Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany.grid.10388.320000 0001 2240 3300', 'Department of Hematology, Damascus Children University Hospital, Ministry of High Education, Damascus, Syria.', 'Cytogenetics and Genomics Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.grid.8051.c0000 0000 9511 4342', 'CIMAGO-Center of Investigation on Environment Genetics and Oncobiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.grid.8051.c0000 0000 9511 4342', 'Cytogenetics and Genomics Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.grid.8051.c0000 0000 9511 4342', 'CIMAGO-Center of Investigation on Environment Genetics and Oncobiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.grid.8051.c0000 0000 9511 4342', 'Jena University Hospital, Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany.grid.10388.320000 0001 2240 3300', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Human Genetics Division, Atomic Energy Commission, Damascus, Syria.grid.459405.90000 0000 9342 9009']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200911,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,PMC7488544,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)', 'Complex karyotype (CK)', 'Molecular cytogenetics', 'Prognostic factors', 'Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)']",2020/09/19 06:00,2020/09/19 06:01,['2020/09/18 05:49'],"['2020/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/18 05:49 [entrez]', '2020/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-020-00512-3 [doi]', '512 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2020 Sep 11;13:44. doi: 10.1186/s13039-020-00512-3. eCollection 2020.,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we aimed to investigate the association of FLT3-ITD gene mutation with bone marrow blast cell count, CD34 expression as malignant cell burden, cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL expressions as indexes of cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis and human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) expression as cytarabine transporter during AML treatment. Methods: We investigated FLT3-ITD mutations, bone marrow blast cell count, CD34, cyclin D1, Bcl-xL and hENT1 expression in bone marrow aspirates from 22 de novo AML patients in a cross sectional study. Results: FLT3-ITD mutations were observed in 5 out of 22 de novo AML patients (22.7%). Patient with FLT3-ITD mutations had higher blast cell counts (79.5% vs 56.1%, P=0.004). In patients with FLT3-ITD mutations, CD34 and cyclin D1 expressions were higher (MFI 328.80 vs 25.78, P=0.003 and MFI 74.51 vs 57.15 P=0.005) than the patients without mutations. hENT1 expression in AML with FLT3-ITD mutation was lower (MFI 29.64 versus 56.32, P=0.0000) than in mutation-free AML. There was no significant difference in Bcl-xL expression between patients with and without mutations (P=0.61). Conclusion: A significant association was found between FLT3-ITD gene mutations in AML patients with bone marrow blast cell count, CD34, cyclin D1 and hENT1 expressions, however no association was obtained with Bcl-xL expression.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by binding to the 3' untranslated region of protein-coding genes. Dysregulation of miRNA expression may result in the development of cancerous phenotypes. Therefore, for the first time in this field, the present study aims to investigate the effect of overexpression of miR-506 in Jurkat (acute T cell leukemia) cell line. Methods: In this study, Jurkat cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium. Next, miR-506 was transfected with concentrations of 50 and 100 nM with Lipofectamine 2000. The accuracy of the transfection was confirmed by the transfection of siRNA conjugated with FITC. 48 h after transfection, the cells were prepared for other tests (flow cytometry, MTT assay, and RNA extraction). The expression level of miR-506 in the cells was analyzed using the quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Finally, SPSS 21 software was used for the data analysis. Results: According to our results, the viability of cells in concentrations of 50 and 100 nM was significantly higher than the control group. By overexpression of miR-506, the expressions of pro-apoptotic genes (p53, p21) and anti-apoptotic gene B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) are decreased and increased, respectively. Conclusion: This study showed that miR-506 may function as an oncogenic miRNA in the T- ALL cell line.

Alantolactone (ALT) has been reported to exhibit anti-tumor activity in different types of cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-tumor activity and molecular mechanism of ALT in ALL. Methods: ALL cell lines were treated with 1, 5 and 10 muM ALT, and cell viability was assessed using an MTT assay and RNA sequencing. Flow cytometry, JC-1 staining and immunofluorescence staining assays were used to measure cell apoptosis and autophagy. Additionally, western blot analysis was used to detect expression of apoptosis and autophagy related proteins. Finally, the effects of ALT on tumor growth were assessed in a BV173 xenograft nude mouse model. Results: ALT inhibited the proliferation of ALL cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, it was demonstrated that ALT inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, autophagy, induced apoptosis and reduced tumor growth in vivo through upregulating the expression of adaptor related protein complex 2 subunit mu 1 (AP2M1). Moreover, the autophagy activator rapamycin, attenuated the pro-apoptotic effects of ALT on BV173 and NALM6 cell lines. Overexpression of AP2M1 decreased the expression of Beclin1 and the LC3-II/LC3-1 ratio, and increased p62 expression. Knockdown of Beclin1 increased the levels of bax, cleaved caspase 3 and cytochrome C, and decreased bcl-2 expression. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that ALT exerts anti-tumor activity through inducing apoptosis and inhibiting autophagy by upregulating AP2M1 in ALL, highlighting a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of ALL.","['Shi, Ce', 'Lan, Wenjia', 'Wang, Zhenkun', 'Yang, Dongguang', 'Wei, Jia', 'Liu, Zhiyu', 'Teng, Yueqiu', 'Gu, Mengmeng', 'Yuan, Tian', 'Cao, Fenglin', 'Zhou, Jin', 'Li, Yang']","['Shi C', 'Lan W', 'Wang Z', 'Yang D', 'Wei J', 'Liu Z', 'Teng Y', 'Gu M', 'Yuan T', 'Cao F', 'Zhou J', 'Li Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9085-0671'],"['Central Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001 Heilongjiang China.grid.412596.d0000 0004 1797 9737', 'Central Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001 Heilongjiang China.grid.412596.d0000 0004 1797 9737', 'Central Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001 Heilongjiang China.grid.412596.d0000 0004 1797 9737', 'Central Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001 Heilongjiang China.grid.412596.d0000 0004 1797 9737', 'Central Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001 Heilongjiang China.grid.412596.d0000 0004 1797 9737', 'Central Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001 Heilongjiang China.grid.412596.d0000 0004 1797 9737', 'Central Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001 Heilongjiang China.grid.412596.d0000 0004 1797 9737', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001 Heilongjiang China.grid.412596.d0000 0004 1797 9737', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, 300060 China.grid.411918.40000 0004 1798 6427', 'Central Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001 Heilongjiang China.grid.412596.d0000 0004 1797 9737', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001 Heilongjiang China.grid.412596.d0000 0004 1797 9737', 'Central Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, 150001 Heilongjiang China.grid.412596.d0000 0004 1797 9737']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200909,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC7488238,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Adaptor related protein complex 2 subunit mu 1', 'Alantolactone', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy']",2020/09/19 06:00,2020/09/19 06:01,['2020/09/18 05:49'],"['2020/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/18 05:49 [entrez]', '2020/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-020-01537-9 [doi]', '1537 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2020 Sep 9;20:442. doi: 10.1186/s12935-020-01537-9. eCollection 2020.,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Central venous catheter-related thrombosis (CVCT) is a major complication that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. We sought to explore the rate of CVCT in a general cancer population in Australia and to identify factors associated with increased risk of thrombosis. Design: This is a multi-centre retrospective cohort study. Setting and participants: We analysed key patient, treatment, and cancer-related factors for 317 patients with cancer and central venous catheters inserted for systemic therapy. Main outcome measures: Symptomatic CVCT confirmed with imaging and management of patients with CVCT. Results: A total of 402 cases of central line insertion were analysed. Central venous catheter-related thrombosis occurred in 24 patients (6.0%). Having a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC; HR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.28-11.19, P = .02) compared with an implantable port and a body mass index of 25.0 kg/m(2) (HR = 3.60, 95% CI = 1.31-9.85, P = .01) were independently associated with increased risk of thrombosis. Central venous catheter-related thrombosis was managed mostly with removal of the catheter (19 of 24 cases) and anticoagulation, including direct-acting oral anticoagulants in 5 patients. Conclusions: This work explored rates of CVCT in a general cancer population, observing increased rates in those with PICCs or increased body mass index.","['Haggstrom, Lucy', 'Parmar, Gurdeep', 'Brungs, Daniel']","['Haggstrom L', 'Parmar G', 'Brungs D']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7179-1223'],"['Department of Medical Oncology, The Wollongong Hospital, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, The Wollongong Hospital, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, The Wollongong Hospital, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.', 'Illawarra Health & Medical Research Institute, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200830,United States,Clin Med Insights Oncol,Clinical Medicine Insights.

This suggests that additional mutations other than ABL1 KD mutations might contribute to disease progression. Methods: We performed targeted-capture sequencing of 127 known and putative cancer-related genes of 63 patients with CML using next-generation sequencing (NGS), including 42 patients with TKI resistance and 21 with TKI intolerance. Results: The differences in the number of mutations between groups had no statistical significance. This could be explained in part by not all of the patients having achieved major molecular remission in the early period as expected. Overall, 66 mutations were identified in 96.8% of the patients, most frequently in the KTM2C (31.82%), ABL1 (31.82%), FAT1 (25.76%), and ASXL1 (22.73%) genes. CUX1, KIT, and GATA2 were associated with TKI intolerance, and two of them (CUX1, GATA2) are transcription factors in which mutations were identified in 82.61% of patients with TKI intolerance. ASXL1 mutations were found more frequently in patients with ABL1 KD mutations (38.1% vs 15.21%, P=0.041). Although the number of mutations was low, pairwise interaction between mutated genes showed that ABL1 KD mutations cooccurred with SH2B3 mutations (P<0.05). In Kaplan-Meier analyses, only TET2 mutations were associated with shorter progression-free survival (P=0.026). Conclusion: Our data suggested that the CUX1, KIT, and GATA2 genes may play important roles in TKI intolerance. ASXL1 and TET2 mutations may be associated with poor patient prognosis. NGS helps improving the clinical risk stratification, which enables the identification of patients with TKI resistance or intolerance in the era of TKI therapy.","['Wu, Waner', 'Xu, Na', 'Zhou, Xuan', 'Liu, Liang', 'Tan, Yaxian', 'Luo, Jie', 'Huang, Jixian', 'Qin, Jiayue', 'Wang, Juan', 'Li, Zhimin', 'Yin, Changxin', 'Zhou, Lingling', 'Liu, Xiaoli']","['Wu W', 'Xu N', 'Zhou X', 'Liu L', 'Tan Y', 'Luo J', 'Huang J', 'Qin J', 'Wang J', 'Li Z', 'Yin C', 'Zhou L', 'Liu X']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1041-8166', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1652-0487', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4721-0016']","[""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Yuebei People's Hospital, Shantou University, Shaoguan 512025, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Yiwu Cancer Research Center, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Yiwu, Zhejiang 322000, People's Republic of China."", ""Yiwu Cancer Research Center, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Yiwu, Zhejiang 322000, People's Republic of China."", ""Yiwu Cancer Research Center, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Yiwu, Zhejiang 322000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200825,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC7468532,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'intolerance', 'mutations', 'resistance', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2020/09/19 06:00,2020/09/19 06:01,['2020/09/18 05:48'],"['2020/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/18 05:48 [entrez]', '2020/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S257661 [doi]', '257661 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2020 Aug 25;13:8581-8591. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S257661. eCollection 2020.,['(c) 2020 Wu et al.'],,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aim to analyze progression-free survival at 24 months (PFS24) and subsequent overall survival (OS) in a large-scale multicenter cohort of patients. 1790 patients were included from the China Lymphoma Collaborative Group (CLCG) database. Subsequent OS was defined from the time of PFS24 or progression within 24 months to death. OS was compared with age- and sex-matched general Chinese population using expected survival and standardized mortality ratio (SMR). Patients who did not achieve PFS24 had a median OS of 5.3 months after progression, with 5-year OS rate of 19.2% and the SMR of 71.4 (95% CI, 62.9-81.1). In contrast, 74% patients achieved PFS24, and the SMR after achieving PFS24 was 1.77 (95% CI, 1.34-2.34). The observed OS rate after PFS24 versus expected OS rate at 5 years was 92.2% versus 94.3%. Similarly, superior outcomes following PFS24 were observed in early-stage patients (5-year OS rate, 92.9%). Patients achieving PFS24 had excellent outcome, whereas patients exhibiting earlier progression had a poor survival. These marked differences suggest that PFS24 may be used for study design and risk stratification in ENKTCL.","['Yang, Yong', 'Wang, Ying', 'Liu, Xin', 'He, Xia', 'Zhang, Li-Ling', 'Wu, Gang', 'Qu, Bao-Lin', 'Qian, Li-Ting', 'Hou, Xiao-Rong', 'Zhang, Fu-Quan', 'Qiao, Xue-Ying', 'Wang, Hua', 'Li, Gao-Feng', 'Zhu, Yuan', 'Cao, Jian-Zhong', 'Wu, Jun-Xin', 'Wu, Tao', 'Zhu, Su-Yu', 'Shi, Mei', 'Xu, Li-Ming', 'Su, Hang', 'Song, Yu-Qin', 'Zhu, Jun', 'Zhang, Yu-Jing', 'Huang, Hui-Qiang', 'Hu, Chen', 'Qi, Shu-Nan', 'Li, Ye-Xiong']","['Yang Y', 'Wang Y', 'Liu X', 'He X', 'Zhang LL', 'Wu G', 'Qu BL', 'Qian LT', 'Hou XR', 'Zhang FQ', 'Qiao XY', 'Wang H', 'Li GF', 'Zhu Y', 'Cao JZ', 'Wu JX', 'Wu T', 'Zhu SY', 'Shi M', 'Xu LM', 'Su H', 'Song YQ', 'Zhu J', 'Zhang YJ', 'Huang HQ', 'Hu C', 'Qi SN', 'Li YX']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9523-9062', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4672-1981', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0921-8052', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0985-235X']","['State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Department of Radiation Oncology, National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) and Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, China.', 'Chongqing University Cancer Hospital & Chongqing Cancer Hospital, Chongqing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Department of Radiation Oncology, National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) and Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, China.', 'Jiangsu Cancer Hospital & Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', ""The General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", 'The Affiliated Provincial Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) and Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, China.', 'Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) and Peking Union Medical College (PUMC), Beijing, China.', 'The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.', 'Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Beijing Hospital, National Geriatric Medical Center, Beijing, China.', 'Cancer Hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Shanxi Cancer Hospital and the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'Fujian Provincial Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou Cancer Hospital, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Hunan Cancer Hospital and the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine, Changsha, Hunan, China.', ""Xijing Hospital of Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China."", 'Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute & Hospital, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Tianjin, China.', 'The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center;

A molecular analysis of 52 genes performed in 330 patients included in this trial, 163 patients being treated with lomustine in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine and 167 without lomustine, identified 1088 mutations with an average of 3.3 mutations per patient. NPM1, FLT3, and DNMT3A were the most frequently mutated genes. A putative therapeutic target was identified in 178 patients (54%). Among five molecular classifications analyzed, the ELN2017 risk classification has the stronger association with the clinical evolution. Patients not treated with lomustine have an expected survival prognosis in agreement with this classification regarding the overall and event-free survivals. In strong contrast, lomustine erased the ELN2017 classification prognosis. The benefit of lomustine in nonadverse chromosomal aberrations was restricted to patients with RUNX1, ASXL1, TP53, and FLT3-ITD(high)/NPM1(WT) mutations in contrast to the intermediate and favorable ELN2017 patients. This post-hoc analysis identified a subgroup of fit elderly AML patients with intermediate cytogenetics and molecular markers who may benefit from lomustine addition to intensive

Here, we show that disruption of the Gdpd3 gene encoding a lysophospholipase D enzyme significantly decreased self-renewal capacity in murine chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) stem cells in vivo. Sophisticated lipidomics analyses revealed that Gdpd3 deficiency reduced levels of certain lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) and lipid mediators in CML cells. Loss of Gdpd3 also activated AKT/mTORC1 signalling and cell cycle progression while suppressing Foxo3a/beta-catenin interaction within CML stem cell nuclei. Strikingly, CML stem cells carrying a hypomorphic mutation of Lgr4/Gpr48, which encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) acting downstream of Gdpd3, displayed inadequate disease-initiating capacity in vivo. Our data showing that lysophospholipid metabolism is required for CML stem cell maintenance in vivo establish a new, biologically significant mechanism of cancer recurrence that is independent of oncogene addiction.","['Naka, Kazuhito', 'Ochiai, Ryosuke', 'Matsubara, Eriko', 'Kondo, Chie', 'Yang, Kyung-Min', 'Hoshii, Takayuki', 'Araki, Masatake', 'Araki, Kimi', 'Sotomaru, Yusuke', 'Sasaki,

BH3 mimetics targeting Bcl-2's hydrophobic cleft have been developed, including venetoclax as a promising anticancer precision medicine for treating CLL patients. Recently, BDA-366 was identified as a small molecule BH4-domain antagonist that could kill lung cancer and multiple myeloma cells. BDA-366 was proposed to switch Bcl-2 from an antiapoptotic into a proapoptotic protein, thereby activating Bax and inducing apoptosis. Here, we scrutinized the therapeutic potential and mechanism of action of BDA-366 in CLL and DLBCL. Although BDA-366 displayed selective toxicity against both cell types, the BDA-366-induced cell death did not correlate with Bcl-2-protein levels and also occurred in the absence of Bcl-2. Moreover, although BDA-366 provoked Bax activation, it did neither directly activate Bax nor switch Bcl-2 into a Bax-activating protein in in vitro Bax/liposome assays. Instead, in primary CLL cells and DLBCL cell lines, BDA-366 inhibited the activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway, resulted in Bcl-2 dephosphorylation and reduced Mcl-1-protein levels without affecting the levels of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Hence, our work challenges the current view that BDA-366 is a BH4-domain antagonist of Bcl-2 that turns Bcl-2 into a pro-apoptotic protein. Rather, our results indicate that other mechanisms beyond switching Bcl-2 conformation underlie BDA-366's cell-death properties that may implicate Mcl-1 downregulation and/or Bcl-2 dephosphorylation.","['Vervloessem, Tamara', 'Sasi, Binu K', 'Xerxa, Elena', 'Karamanou, Spyridoula', 'Kale, Justin', 'La Rovere, Rita M', 'Chakraborty, Supriya', 'Sneyers, Flore', 'Vogler, Meike', 'Economou, Anastassios', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Andrews, David W', 'Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Bultynck, Geert']","['Vervloessem T', 'Sasi BK', 'Xerxa E', 'Karamanou S', 'Kale J', 'La Rovere RM', 'Chakraborty S', 'Sneyers F', 'Vogler M', 'Economou A', 'Laurenti L', 'Andrews DW', 'Efremov DG', 'Bultynck G']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4915-0806', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1770-507X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9266-7157', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5968-4828']","['KU Leuven, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine & Leuven Kanker Instituut (LKI), Leuven, Belgium.', 'Molecular Hematology, International Center for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Molecular Hematology, International Center for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'KU Leuven, Laboratory of Molecular Bacteriology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Biological Sciences, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'KU Leuven, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine & Leuven Kanker Instituut (LKI), Leuven, Belgium.', 'Molecular Hematology, International Center for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'KU Leuven, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signaling, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine & Leuven Kanker Instituut (LKI), Leuven, Belgium.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'KU Leuven, Laboratory of Molecular Bacteriology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Hematology Institute, Catholic University Hospital ""A.

Methods: Data from 83 patients with NSAA between August 2014 and February 2019 were collected retrospectively. The study population included 35 men and 48 women, with a median age of 45 years (14-85 years) . Among them, 57 had been treated with CsA + rhTPO, TPO was administered at 15 000 U QD for 7 days, once a month for 3 months, and the other 26 patients with compatible baseline characters were treated with CsA alone. All the enrolled patients had been treated with CsA for at least 6 months and were followed up for at least 1 year. The efficacy and outcome were compared between the two groups. Results: Total 23 men and 34 women, with a median age of 46 years (14-85 years) were treated with CsA + rhTPO. The median duration of CsA treatment was 17 (8-28) months, and the patients were followed up for a median of 27 (12-45) months. Total 12 men and 14 women, with a median age of 40 years (20-64) were treated with CsA alone. The median duration of CsA treatment was 19 months (9-30 months) , and the median follow-up duration was 29 months (16-66 months) . There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics of the two groups (P>0.05) . There was no significant difference in the CR and OR rates of the two groups at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment (P>0.05) . The change in the platelet level for the CsA + rhTPO treated group after 1 month[8 (-12-86) x10(9)/L vs. 3 (16-57) x10(9)/L, P=0.029) , 3 months[24 (-6-102) x10(9)/L vs. 7 (-9-76) x10(9)/L, P=0.006], and 6 months[33.5 (-4-123) x10(9)/L vs. 12.5 (-14-109) x10(9)/L, P=0.048] of treatment was higher than that in the CsA alone group, while no significant difference was found between the two groups at other time points. There was no significant difference in the change in the megakaryocyte level between the two groups[3 (0-4) vs. 2 (0-5) , z=-0.868, P=0.385] after 6 months of treatment. Apart from 10.5% (6/57) of the patients in the CsA + rhTPO treated group who reported soreness at the injection site, there was no other significant difference between the two groups in terms of adverse effects. During the follow-up period, there were two cases of increasing paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clone to over 10%, one in the CsA + rhTPO treated group, the other in the CsA alone group; and there was one case of progression to SAA in the CsA + rhTPO treated group; while no case of death or thromboembolic event (TEE) , fibrosis or reticulin proliferation, progression to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) , or acute myeloid leukemia was observed in either group. There was one case of progression to SAA in the CsA + rhTPO treated group but none in the CsA alone group. Conclusion: Compared to CsA alone, CsA + rhTPO treatment can accelerate the recovery of the platelet level with acceptable adverse effects.","['Zhang, M L', 'Chen, W S', 'Han, B']","['Zhang ML', 'Chen WS', 'Han B']",,"['Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medicine Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medicine Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medicine Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Anemia, Aplastic', 'Cyclosporine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombopoietin/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC7525171,['NOTNLM'],"['Adverse effects', 'Aplastic anemia', 'Cyclosporin A', 'Recombined human thrombopoietin', 'Treatment outcome']",2020/09/19 06:00,2020/10/24 06:00,['2020/09/18 03:07'],"['2020/09/18 03:07 [entrez]', '2020/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.08.004 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Aug 14;41(8):637-642. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.08.004.,,"['7192168/Natural Science Foundation of Beijing', '2016-I2M-3-004/Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) Innovation fund for', 'Medical Sciences', '2019XK320047/Non-profit Central Research Institute Fund of Chinese Academy of', 'Medical Sciences']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Consecutive patients with T-LGL following allo-HSCT who visited our center from June 2013 to February 2020 were studied retrospectively. We compared patients undergoing allo-HSCT during this period. The clinical characteristics, related factors, cumulative incidence of patients with T-LGL and rates of overall survival (OS) , disease free survival (DFS) , relapse, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were analyzed. Results: Total 359 patients were enrolled, including 17 with T-LGL and 342 without T-LGL following allo-HSCT. The median follow-up duration was 38 (3-92) month. The cumulative incidence at 1-, 2- and 3-years of T-LGL was 3.64% (95%CI 1.09%-6.19%) , 4.50% (95%CI 1.36%-7.64%) , and 4.84% (95%CI 1.10%-8.76%) , respectively. CMV reactivation (P=0.013) , EB viremia (P=0.034) , and aGVHD (P=0.027) were associated with the development of T-LGL following allo-HSCT. Multivariate analysis showed that benign hematologic diseases[P=0.027, OR=3.36 (95%CI 1.15-9.89) ] and haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation[P=0.030, OR=4.67 (95%CI 1.16-18.75) ], unrelated donor transplantation[P=0.041, OR=5.49 (95%CI 1.10-28.16) ] were independent predictive factors of T-LGL following allo-HSCT. There was a significant difference in the 3-year OS (100.0% vs. 78.6%, P=0.04) , DFS (100.0% vs. 70.0%, P=0.01) , and NRM (0 vs. 12.6%, P=0.02) between the 2 cohorts. Subgroup analysis showed that malignant diseases recipients who developed T-LGL had better outcomes after allo-HSCT, and there was a significant difference in the NRM (P=0.042) , DFS (P=0.013) , and cumulative relapse rate (P=0.028) between the 2 cohorts. In contrast, the appearance of T-LGL after allo-HSCT in patients with benign diseases had no significant effect on the prognosis. Conclusions: T-LGL was a durable and clinically benign phenomenon occurring in allo-HSCT recipients with malignant diseases. Factors associated with immune reconstitution and T-cell regulatory mechanisms might be major predictors of T-LGL following allo-HSCT.","['Zhao, F', 'Shi, Y Y', 'Zhang, G X', 'Zhai, W H', 'Pang, A M', 'Ma, Q L', 'Zhang, R L', 'Wei, J L', 'Huang, Y', 'Yang, D L', 'He, Y', 'Jiang, E L', 'Feng, S Z', 'Han, M Z']","['Zhao F', 'Shi YY', 'Zhang GX', 'Zhai WH', 'Pang AM', 'Ma QL', 'Zhang RL', 'Wei JL', 'Huang Y', 'Yang DL', 'He Y', 'Jiang EL', 'Feng SZ', 'Han MZ']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC7525168,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Large granular lymphocytes', 'Prognosis']",2020/09/19 06:00,2020/10/24 06:00,['2020/09/18 03:07'],"['2020/09/18 03:07 [entrez]', '2020/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.08.003 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Aug 14;41(8):630-636. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.08.003.,,"['81670171/National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant', '2018PT32034/The Non-profit Central Research Institute Fund of Chinese Academy of', 'Medical Sciences']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional semen analysis does not explain the molecular changes in the spermatozoa of cancer patients. Currently, proteomics is being widely used to identify the fertility-associated molecular pathways affected in spermatozoa. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sperm proteome of patients with various types of cancer. Cryopreserved semen samples from patients (testicular cancer, n = 40; Hodgkin's disease, n = 32; lymphoma, n = 20; leukemia, n = 17) before starting therapy were used for proteomic analysis, while samples from fertile donors (n = 19) were included as controls. The proteomic profiling of sperm was carried out by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and differentially expressed proteins involved in the reproductive processes were validated by Western blotting. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that proteins associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative phosphorylation, and Sirtuin signaling pathways were dysregulated in cancer patients, while oxidative phosphorylation and tricarboxylic acid cycle were predicted to be deactivated. Furthermore, the analysis revealed dysregulation of key proteins associated with sperm fertility potential and motility (NADH:Ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S1, superoxide dismutase 1, SERPINA5, and cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 2) in the cancer group, which were further validated by Western blot. Dysfunctional molecular mechanisms essential for fertility in cancer patients prior to therapy highlight the potential impact of cancer phenotype on male fertility.","['Panner Selvam, Manesh Kumar', 'Finelli, Renata', 'Baskaran, Saradha', 'Agarwal, Ashok']","['Panner Selvam MK', 'Finelli R', 'Baskaran S', 'Agarwal A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5926-6407', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4499-8680', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0585-1026']","['American Center for Reproductive Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'American Center for Reproductive Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'American Center for Reproductive Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'American Center for Reproductive Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20200915,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Proteome)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuins)']",IM,"['Citric Acid Cycle/physiology', 'Fertility/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mitochondrial Diseases/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Phenotype', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Reproduction/physiology', 'Semen/metabolism', 'Semen Analysis/methods', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Sirtuins/metabolism', 'Sperm Motility/*physiology', 'Spermatozoa/metabolism/pathology']",PMC7554694,['NOTNLM'],"['bioinformatics', 'cancer', 'male infertility', 'proteomics', 'sperm']",2020/09/19 06:00,2021/02/25 06:00,['2020/09/18 01:02'],"['2020/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/18 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/09/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21186754 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21186754 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Sep 15;21(18). pii: ijms21186754. doi: 10.3390/ijms21186754.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, generalized relative and absolute rate models are fitted to the latest Japanese atomic bomb survivor solid cancer, leukemia and circulatory disease mortality data (followed from 1950 through 2003), with the latest (DS02R1) dosimetry, using Bayesian techniques to adjust for errors in dose estimates and assessing other model uncertainties. Linear-quadratic models are fitted and used to assess lifetime mortality risks for contemporary UK, USA, French, Russian, Japanese and Chinese populations. For a test dose of 0.1 Gy absorbed dose weighted by neutron relative biological effectiveness, solid cancer, leukemia and circulatory disease mortality risks for a UK population using a generalized linear-quadratic relative rate model were estimated to be 3.88% Gy-1 [95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 1.17, 6.97], 0.35% Gy-1 (95% BCI: -0.03, 0.78) and 2.24% Gy-1 (95% BCI: -0.17, 13.76), respectively. Using a generalized absolute rate linear-quadratic model at 0.1 Gy, the lifetime risks for these three end points were estimated to be 3.56% Gy-1 (95% BCI: 0.54, 6.78), 0.41% Gy-1 (95% BCI: 0.01, 0.86) and 1.56% Gy-1 (95% BCI: -1.10, 7.21), respectively. There was substantial evidence of curvature for solid cancer (in particular, the group of solid cancers excluding lung, breast and stomach cancers) and leukemia, so that for solid cancer and leukemia, estimates of excess risk per unit dose were nearly doubled by increasing the dose from 0.01 to 1.0 Gy, with most of the increase occurring in the interval from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy. For circulatory disease, the dose-response curvature was inverse, so that risk per unit dose was nearly halved by going from 0.01 t o 1.0 Gy weighted absorbed dose, although there were substantial uncertainties. In general, there were higher radiation risks for females compared to males. This was true for solid cancer and circulatory disease overall, as well as for lung, breast, stomach and the group of other solid cancers, and was the case whether relative or absolute rate projection models were employed; however, for leukemia this pattern was reversed. Risk estimates varied somewhat between populations, with lower cancer risks in aggregate for China and Russia, but higher circulatory disease risks for Russia, particularly using the relative rate model. There was more pronounced variation for certain cancer sites and certain types of projection models, so that breast cancer risk was markedly lower in China and Japan using a relative rate model, but the opposite was the case for stomach cancer.

Its toxicity to liver and lungs and the underlying mechanisms, however, are controversially discussed. Along this line, novel tetrandrine analogues were synthesized and biologically evaluated for their hepatotoxicity, as well as their antiproliferative and chemoresistance reversing activity on cancer cells. Previous studies suggesting CYP-mediated toxification of tetrandrine prompted us to amend/replace the suspected metabolically instable 12-methoxy group. Of note, employing several in vitro models showed that the proposed CYP3A4-driven metabolism of tetrandrine and analogues is not the major cause of hepatotoxicity. Biological characterization revealed that some of the novel tetrandrine analogues sensitized drug-resistant leukemia cells by inhibition of the P-glycoprotein. Interestingly, direct anticancer effects improved in comparison to tetrandrine, as several compounds displayed a markedly enhanced ability to reduce proliferation of drug-resistant leukemia cells and to induce cell death of liver cancer cells. Those enhanced anticancer properties were linked to influences on activation of the kinase Akt and mitochondrial events. In sum, our study clarifies the role of CYP3A4-mediated toxicity of the bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid tetrandrine and provides the basis for the exploitation of novel synthetic analogues for their antitumoral potential.","['Schutz, Ramona', 'Muller, Martin', 'Geisslinger, Franz', 'Vollmar, Angelika', 'Bartel, Karin', 'Bracher, Franz']","['Schutz R', 'Muller M', 'Geisslinger F', 'Vollmar A', 'Bartel K', 'Bracher F']",,"['Department of Pharmacy, Center for Drug Research, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Butenandtstr. 5-13, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Center for Drug Research, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Butenandtstr. 5-13, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Center for Drug Research, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Butenandtstr. 5-13, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Center for Drug Research, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Butenandtstr. 5-13, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Center for Drug Research, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Butenandtstr. 5-13, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Center for Drug Research, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Butenandtstr. 5-13, 81377, Munich, Germany.

Where sufficient information exists, it can provide the OEL developer the basis for selecting either a health-based or risk-based approach. To support the development of an OEL for benzene, scientific information relevant to MOA assessment for risk-based and health-based OEL approaches was reviewed. Direct-acting mutagenicity was considered as a basis for a risk-based OEL, versus MOAs consistent with a health-based approach: indirect mutagenicity via topoisomerase II inhibition, indirect mutagenicity via reactive oxygen species generation, or an immune-based bone marrow dysfunction. Based on the evidence against direct DNA reactivity, threshold expectations for remaining MOAs, and evidence for dose rate affecting acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome risk, the weight of evidence favors a health-based OEL approach. In the case of benzene, development of an OEL based on observations of earlier key events (i.e., hematologic changes and genetic toxicity) is anticipated to provide protection from later adverse outcomes such as leukemia.","['North, Colin M', 'Rooseboom, Martijn', 'Kocabas, Neslihan Aygun', 'Schnatter, A Robert', 'Faulhammer, Frank', 'Williams, Stephen D']","['North CM', 'Rooseboom M', 'Kocabas NA', 'Schnatter AR', 'Faulhammer F', 'Williams SD']",,"['ExxonMobil Biomedical Sciences, Inc., US Highway 22 East, Annandale, NJ, 08801 USA.

The protein level of TdT was determined by flow cytometry, and qPCR was used for mRNA expression analysis. Mismatch PNAs were used as control to address the sequence/target spcifity of the biological effects. The results showed that treatment with the AUG- and to slightly lesser extent with the 5'-UTR-antisense PNAs reduced the TdT mRNA as wel as the protein level, whereas only very low effect was observed for the 5'-UTR-sense PNA. A parallel effect was observed on reduced cell survival and increased rate of apoptosis.

We retrospectively analyzed 5331 patients who received UR-BMT or UR-CBT between 2008 and 2017. Patients were divided into four groups according to time from diagnosis to transplantation: (1) UR-BMT and > 5 months (n = 2353), (2) UR-BMT and </= 5 months (n = 379), (3) UR-CBT and > 5 months (n = 1494), and (4) UR-CBT and </= 5 months (n = 1106). There was no difference in overall survival (OS) for transplantation at </=5 months and > 5 months in patients with first complete remission for both UR-BMT and UR-CBT, but OS in patients with primary induction failure (PIF) and transplantation at </= 5 months was significantly higher in the UR-CBT group compared with that at >5 months (P < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis also showed that transplantation at >5 months in patients with PIF was an independent predictor of poorer OS. Therefore, UR-CBT at </= 5 months after diagnosis is an alternative option for AML patients with PIF.","['Yamasaki, Satoshi', 'Mori, Jinichi', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Imahashi, Nobuhiko', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Doki, Noriko', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Katayama, Yuta', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Takada, Satoru', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Hino, Masayuki', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Yanada, Masamitsu']","['Yamasaki S', 'Mori J', 'Kanda J', 'Imahashi N', 'Uchida N', 'Doki N', 'Tanaka M', 'Katayama Y', 'Eto T', 'Ozawa Y', 'Takada S', 'Onizuka M', 'Hino M', 'Kanda Y', 'Fukuda T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Yanada M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6143-7906'],"['Department of Hematology and Clinical Research Institute, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan. yamas009@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Jyoban Hospital, Iwaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Federation of National Public Service Personnel Mutual Aid Associations Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Leukemia Research Center, Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200917,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics/*therapy', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Societies, Medical', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Bone marrow transplantation', 'Cord blood stem cell transplantation', 'Unrelated donors']",2020/09/18 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/09/17 12:17'],"['2020/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/17 12:17 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04261-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04261-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Dec;99(12):2927-2937. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04261-6.

We recently identified a partial retention of FPGS intron 8 (8PR) as a prominent splice variant conferring FPGS dysfunction and decreased MTX polyglutamylation in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Here, we explored the association between FPGS 8PR levels and lack of MTX responsiveness in RA patients. METHODS: Thirty-six patients undergoing MTX treatment were enrolled from the Combinatie behandeling Reumatoide Artritis (COBRA)-light trial. RNA was isolated from blood samples at baseline, 13 weeks and 26 weeks of therapy, from patients in either COBRA-light (n = 21) or COBRA (n = 15) treatment arms. RT-qPCR analysis was used to assess RNA levels of FPGS 8PR over wild-type FPGS (8WT). RESULTS: In the COBRA-light treatment arm, higher baseline ratios of 8PR/8WT were significantly associated with higher 44-joint disease activity score (DAS44) at 13 and 26 weeks. Higher baseline ratios of 8PR/8WT also trended towards not obtaining low disease activity (DAS <1.6) and becoming a EULAR non-responder at 13 and 26 weeks. In the COBRA-treatment arm, a significant association was observed between high baseline 8PR/8WT ratios and higher DAS44 score at 26 weeks. Higher 8PR/8WT ratios were associated with non-response at week 26 based on both low disease activity and EULAR criteria. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to associate alterations in FPGS pre-mRNA splicing levels with reduced responsiveness to MTX treatment in RA patients.

The transition metal vanadium, widely exists in the environment and exhibits various biological and physiological effects in the human body, yet with no presently known specific physiological function in mammals. Sodium orthovanadate (SOV) is a kind of vanadium compound. SOV has shown promising antineoplastic activity in several human cancers. But the effects of SOV on acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) are still unknown. In the present study, for the first time, we found that SOV could inhibit proliferation, induce G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and could inhibit autophagy of acute leukemia cell lines in vitro. Thus, our findings suggest that SOV could effectively suppress the growth of acute leukemia HL60 cells and HL60/A cells through the regulations of proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and autophagy, and thus may act as a potential therapeutic agent in APL treatment.","['Zhang, Lulu', 'Wei, Nan', 'Guan, Guoying', 'Song, Tao', 'Xu, Yingying', 'Wang, Shuye', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Zhang L', 'Wei N', 'Guan G', 'Song T', 'Xu Y', 'Wang S', 'Zhou J']",,"['Department of Gerontology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China.', 'Department of Gerontology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China.', 'Department of Gerontology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China.', 'Department of Gerontology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China.', 'Department of Gerontology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150001, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Vanadates/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",PMC7522360,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', '*Sodium orthovanadate']",2020/09/18 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/09/17 12:16'],"['2020/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/17 12:16 [entrez]']","['226437 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20201918 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosci Rep. 2020 Sep 30;40(9). pii: 226437. doi: 10.1042/BSR20201918.,['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiological studies have identified associations between increased coffee consumption and decreased recurrence and mortality of colorectal cancer. The association between coffee consumption and survival in patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer is unknown. Objective: To evaluate the association of coffee consumption with disease progression and death in patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective observational cohort study included 1171 patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer who were enrolled in Cancer and Leukemia Group B (Alliance)/SWOG 80405, a completed phase 3 clinical trial comparing the addition of cetuximab and/or bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy. Patients reported dietary intake using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire at the time of enrollment. Data were collected from October 27, 2005, to January 18, 2018, and analyzed from May 1 to August 31, 2018. Exposures: Consumption of total, decaffeinated, and caffeinated coffee measured in cups per day. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Among the 1171 patients included in the analysis (694 men [59%]; median age, 59 [interquartile range, 51-67] years). The median follow-up time among living patients was 5.4 years (10th percentile, 1.3 years; IQR, 3.2-6.3 years). A total of 1092 patients (93%) had died or had disease progression. Increased consumption of coffee was associated with decreased risk of cancer progression (hazard ratio [HR] for 1-cup/d increment, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-1.00; P = .04 for trend) and death (HR for 1-cup/d increment, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89-0.98; P = .004 for trend). Participants who consumed 2 to 3 cups of coffee per day had a multivariable HR for OS of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.67-1.00) and for PFS of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.68-0.99), compared with those who did not drink coffee. Participants who consumed at least 4 cups of coffee per day had a multivariable HR for OS of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.46-0.87) and for PFS of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.59-1.05). Significant associations were noted for both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. Conclusions and Relevance: Coffee consumption may be associated with reduced risk of disease progression and death in patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. Further research is warranted to elucidate underlying biological mechanisms.","['Mackintosh, Christopher', 'Yuan, Chen', 'Ou, Fang-Shu', 'Zhang, Sui', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Chang, I-Wen', ""O'Neil, Bert H"", 'Mullen, Brian C', 'Lenz, Heinz-Josef', 'Blanke, Charles D', 'Venook, Alan P', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Fuchs, Charles S', 'Innocenti, Federico', 'Nixon, Andrew B', 'Goldberg, Richard M', ""O'Reilly, Eileen M"", 'Meyerhardt, Jeffrey A', 'Ng, Kimmie']","['Mackintosh C', 'Yuan C', 'Ou FS', 'Zhang S', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Chang IW', ""O'Neil BH"", 'Mullen BC', 'Lenz HJ', 'Blanke CD', 'Venook AP', 'Mayer RJ', 'Fuchs CS', 'Innocenti F', 'Nixon AB', 'Goldberg RM', ""O'Reilly EM"", 'Meyerhardt JA', 'Ng K']",,"['currently a medical student at Mayo Clinic School of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Management Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Southeast Clinical Oncology Research Consortium, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Management Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.', ""SWOG Group Chair's Office/Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland."", 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Eshelman School of Pharmacy and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.', 'West Virginia University Cancer Institute, Morgantown.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, Cornell University and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,,IM,,PMC7499248,,,2020/09/18 06:00,2020/09/18 06:00,['2020/09/17 12:16'],"['2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/17 12:16 [entrez]']","['2770262 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.3938 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2020 Nov 1;6(11):1713-1721. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.3938.,,"['UG1 CA233290/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA118553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189974/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA232760/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA205406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233373/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180830/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA169141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA127003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors analyzed population-based cancer incidence and mortality for AYAs in the United States by age group (ages 15-19, 20-29, and 30-39 years), sex, and race/ethnicity. In 2020, there will be approximately 89,500 new cancer cases and 9270 cancer deaths in AYAs. Overall cancer incidence increased in all AYA age groups during the most recent decade (2007-2016), largely driven by thyroid cancer, which rose by approximately 3% annually among those aged 20 to 39 years and 4% among those aged 15 to 19 years. Incidence also increased in most age groups for several cancers linked to obesity, including kidney (3% annually across all age groups), uterine corpus (3% in the group aged 20-39 years), and colorectum (0.9%-1.5% in the group aged 20-39 years). Rates declined dramatically for melanoma in the group aged 15 to 29 years (4%-6% annually) but remained stable among those aged 30 to 39 years. Overall cancer mortality declined during 2008 through 2017 by 1% annually across age and sex groups, except for women aged 30 to 39 years, among whom rates were stable because of a flattening of declines in female breast cancer. Rates increased for cancers of the colorectum and uterine corpus in the group aged 30 to 39 years, mirroring incidence trends. Five-year relative survival in AYAs is similar across age groups for all cancers combined (range, 83%-86%) but varies widely for some cancers, such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (74% in the group aged 15-19 years vs 51% in the group aged 30-39 years) and brain tumors (77% vs 66%), reflecting differences in histologic subtype distribution and treatment. Progress in reducing cancer morbidity and mortality among AYAs could be addressed through more equitable access to health care, increasing clinical trial enrollment, expanding research, and greater alertness among clinicians and patients for early symptoms and signs of cancer. Further progress could be accelerated with increased disaggregation by age in research on surveillance, etiology, basic biology, and survivorship.","['Miller, Kimberly D', 'Fidler-Benaoudia, Miranda', 'Keegan, Theresa H', 'Hipp, Heather S', 'Jemal, Ahmedin', 'Siegel, Rebecca L']","['Miller KD', 'Fidler-Benaoudia M', 'Keegan TH', 'Hipp HS', 'Jemal A', 'Siegel RL']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2609-2260', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0000-4111', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5247-8522']","['Surveillance Research, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention Research, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Hematology and Oncology, University of California at Davis Health, Sacramento, California.', 'Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Surveillance Research, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Surveillance Research, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200917,United States,CA Cancer J Clin,CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,0370647,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/ethnology/mortality', 'Racial Groups/statistics & numerical data', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*adolescent cancer', '*childhood cancer', '*epidemiology', '*pediatric cancer']",2020/09/18 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/09/17 08:48'],"['2020/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/17 08:48 [entrez]']",['10.3322/caac.21637 [doi]'],ppublish,CA Cancer J Clin. 2020 Nov;70(6):443-459. doi: 10.3322/caac.21637.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, nationwide study including 66 patients in follow-up at Danish haematology departments with a malignant or non-malignant haematological disorder and with verified SARS-CoV-2 infection. Outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU) admission and one-month survival rate. RESULTS: Mean age was 66.7 years, 60.6% were males, 90.9% had comorbidity, and 13.6% had a BMI >/= 30. The most frequent diagnoses were chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/lymphoma (47.0%), multiple myeloma (16.7%) and acute leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AL/MDS) (12.1%). Treatment for the haematological disease was ongoing in 59.1% of cases. Neutropenia was present in 6.5%, lymphopenia in 46.6% and hypogammaglobulinaemia in 26.3%. The SARS-CoV-2 infection was mild in 50.0%, severe in 36.4% and critical in 13.6%. After one month, 21.2% had been admitted to ICU, and 24.2% died. Mortality was highest in older patients, patients with severe/critical SARS-CoV-2 infection, high comorbidity score or high performance status score, purine analogue treatment and with AL/MDS. Although older patients and patients with comorbidities had the highest mortality rates, mortality was considerable among all haematological patients. CONCLUSION: Haematological patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection has a severe clinical course.","['Glenthoj, Andreas', 'Jakobsen, Lasse H', 'Sengelov, Henrik', 'Ahmad, Syed A', 'Qvist, Kristian', 'Rewes, Annika', 'Poulsen, Christian B', 'Overgaard, Ulrik M', 'Molle, Ingolf', 'Severinsen, Marianne T', 'Strandholdt, Casper N', 'Maibom, Jack', 'Kodahl, Annette R', 'Ryg, Jesper', 'Ravn, Pernille', 'Johansen, Isik S', 'Helso, Soren N', 'Jensen-Fangel, Soren', 'Kisielewicz, Jacek', 'Wiese, Lothar', 'Helleberg, Marie', 'Kirk, Ole', 'Clausen, Michael R', 'Frederiksen, Henrik']","['Glenthoj A', 'Jakobsen LH', 'Sengelov H', 'Ahmad SA', 'Qvist K', 'Rewes A', 'Poulsen CB', 'Overgaard UM', 'Molle I', 'Severinsen MT', 'Strandholdt CN', 'Maibom J', 'Kodahl AR', 'Ryg J', 'Ravn P', 'Johansen IS', 'Helso SN', 'Jensen-Fangel S', 'Kisielewicz J', 'Wiese L', 'Helleberg M', 'Kirk O', 'Clausen MR', 'Frederiksen H']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8988-2633', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3218-3633', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8905-0220']","['Department of Haematology, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Hellerup, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Glostrup, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Hellerup, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Holstebro Hospital, Holstebro, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Zeeland University Hospital Roskilde, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Glostrup, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospital of South West Jutland, Esbjerg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Zeeland University Hospital Roskilde, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Oncology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'OPEN, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'OPEN, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Academy of Geriatric Cancer Research (AgeCare), Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section for Infectious Diseases, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Hellerup, Denmark.', 'OPEN, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Southern Jutland Hospital, Aabenraa, Denmark.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Zeeland University Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Glostrup, Denmark.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Glostrup, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Lillebaelt Hospital, Vejle, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'OPEN, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Academy of Geriatric Cancer Research (AgeCare), Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20200929,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'COVID-19/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', '*SARS-CoV-2', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,['NOTNLM'],['immunology and infectious diseases'],2020/09/18 06:00,2020/12/23 06:00,['2020/09/17 05:48'],"['2020/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/17 05:48 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13519 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2021 Jan;106(1):72-81. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13519.

This study aimed to assess the risk of leukemia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis by systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and SinoMed up to December 2019. Random effects model analysis was used to pool standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: A total of 15 relevant studies that met the criteria were included. Compared with the general population, patients with RA showed an increased risk of leukemia (SIR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.34-1.70). The statistical heterogeneity was moderate with an I(2) of 55.5%. In subgroup analysis, the source of heterogeneity may be due to differences in sample size. Publication bias was not found in the Begg funnel plot and the Egger test.

Thus, investigators identified a number of prognostic biomarkers and scoring systems to guide treatment decisions and validated them in the context of immunochemotherapy. A better understanding of prognostic biomarkers, including serum markers, flow cytometry outcomes, IGHV mutation status, microRNAs, chromosome aberrations and gene mutations, have contributed to prognosis in CLL. Del17p/ TP53 mutation, NOTCH1 mutation, CD49d, IGHV mutation status, complex karyotypes and microRNAs were reported to be of predictive values to guide clinical decisions. Based on the biomarkers above, classic prognostic models, such as the Rai and Binet staging systems, MDACC nomogram, GCLLSG model and CLL-IPI, were developed to improve risk stratification and tailor treatment intensity. Considering the presence of novel agents, many investigators validated the conventional prognostic biomarkers in the setting of novel agents and only TP53 mutation status/del 17p and CD49d expression were reported to be of prognostic value. Whether other prognostic indicators and models can be used in the context of novel agents, further studies are required.","['Yun, Xiaoya', 'Zhang, Ya', 'Wang, Xin']","['Yun X', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang X']",,"['Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250021 Shandong China.grid.27255.370000 0004 1761 1174', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, No.324, Jingwu Road, Jinan, 250021 Shandong China.grid.460018.b0000 0004 1769 9639', 'School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012 Shandong China.grid.27255.370000 0004 1761 1174', 'Shandong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Lymphoma, Jinan, 250021 Shandong China.', 'National clinical research center for hematologic diseases, Jinan, 250021 Shandong China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250021 Shandong China.grid.27255.370000 0004 1761 1174', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, No.324, Jingwu Road, Jinan, 250021 Shandong China.grid.460018.b0000 0004 1769 9639', 'School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012 Shandong China.grid.27255.370000 0004 1761 1174', 'Shandong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Lymphoma, Jinan, 250021 Shandong China.', 'National clinical research center for hematologic diseases, Jinan, 250021 Shandong China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250021 Shandong China.grid.27255.370000 0004 1761 1174', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, No.324, Jingwu Road, Jinan, 250021 Shandong China.grid.460018.b0000 0004 1769 9639', 'School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012 Shandong China.grid.27255.370000 0004 1761 1174', 'Shandong Provincial Engineering Research Center of Lymphoma, Jinan, 250021 Shandong China.', 'National clinical research center for hematologic diseases, Jinan, 250021 Shandong China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200907,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,,PMC7487566,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Prognosis', 'Prognostic biomarkers', 'Risk scoring systems']",2020/09/18 06:00,2020/09/18 06:01,['2020/09/17 05:44'],"['2020/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/17 05:44 [entrez]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-020-00222-3 [doi]', '222 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2020 Sep 7;8:40. doi: 10.1186/s40364-020-00222-3. eCollection 2020.,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using Danish National Cancer Registry data and Danish DEHM-UBM-AirGIS system-modelled air pollution exposures, we examined whether particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) averaged over 1, 5 or 10 years were associated with adult leukaemia in general or by subtype. In all, 14,986 adult cases diagnosed 1989-2014 and 51,624 age, sex and time-matched controls were included. Separate conditional logistic regression models, adjusted for socio-demographic factors, assessed exposure to each pollutant with leukaemias. RESULTS: Fully adjusted models showed a higher risk of leukaemia with higher 1-, 5- and 10-year-average exposures to PM2.5 prior to diagnosis (e.g. OR per 10 microg/m(3) for 10-year average: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.32), and a positive relationship with 1-year average BC. Results were driven by participants 70 years and older (OR per 10 microg/m(3) for 10-year average: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.15-1.58). Null findings for younger participants. Higher 1-year average PM2.5 exposures were associated with higher risks for acute myeloid and chronic lymphoblastic leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Among older adults, higher risk for leukaemia was associated with higher residential PM2.5 concentrations averaged over 1, 5 and 10 years prior to diagnosis.","['Puett, Robin C', 'Poulsen, Aslak Harbo', 'Taj, Tahir', 'Ketzel, Matthias', 'Geels, Camilla', 'Brandt, Jorgen', 'Christensen, Jesper H', 'Sorensen, Mette', 'Roswall, Nina', 'Hvidtfeldt, Ulla', 'Raaschou-Nielsen, Ole']","['Puett RC', 'Poulsen AH', 'Taj T', 'Ketzel M', 'Geels C', 'Brandt J', 'Christensen JH', 'Sorensen M', 'Roswall N', 'Hvidtfeldt U', 'Raaschou-Nielsen O']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3418-4341'],"['Institute for Applied Environmental Health, School of Public Health, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA. rpuett@umd.edu.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark. rpuett@umd.edu.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus University, Frederiksborgvej 399, P.O.

In leukemic cells however, SHOC2 upregulation has been previously related to an increased 5-year event-free survival of pediatric pre-B acute lymphoid leukemia, suggesting that SHOC2 could be a potential prognostic marker. To address such paradoxical function, our study investigated how SHOC2 impact leukemic cells drug response. Our transcriptome analysis has shown that SHOC2 can modulate the DNA-damage mediated by p53. Notably, upon genetic inhibition of SHOC2 we observed a significant impairment of p53 expression, which in turn, leads to the blockage of key apoptotic molecules. To confirm the specificity of DNA-damage related modulation, several anti-leukemic drugs has been tested and we did confirm that the proposed mechanism impairs cell death upon daunorubicin-induced DNA damage of human lymphoid cells. In conclusion, our study uncovers new insights into SHOC2 function and reveals that this scaffold protein may be essential to activate a novel mechanism of p53-induced cell death in pre-B lymphoid cells.","['Silveira, Vanessa Silva', 'Borges, Kleiton Silva', 'Santos, Verena Silva', 'Ruckert, Mariana Tannus', 'Vieira, Gabriela Maciel', 'Vasconcelos, Elton Jose Rosas', 'Nagano, Luis Fernando Peinado', 'Tone, Luiz Gonzaga', 'Scrideli, Carlos Alberto']","['Silveira VS', 'Borges KS', 'Santos VS', 'Ruckert MT', 'Vieira GM', 'Vasconcelos EJR', 'Nagano LFP', 'Tone LG', 'Scrideli CA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5633-9490'],"['Department of Genetics, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil. vsilveira@fmrp.usp.br.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Leeds Omics, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200916,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (SHOC2 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",PMC7495473,,,2020/09/18 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2020/09/17 05:40'],"['2020/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/17 05:40 [entrez]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-72124-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-72124-1 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Sep 16;10(1):15193. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-72124-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the virological characteristic, HTLV-1 can transmit efficiently only through cell-to-cell contact. Spread of infection and viral persistence is ingeniously driven by several viral genes as exemplified by HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) and tax. After the infection, the virus promotes proliferation and immortalization of the infected cells with acculturating immunophenotype into effector/memory T cells. In addition, HBZ enhances expression of co-inhibitory receptors on the surface of infected cells, potentially leading to suppression of host immune responses. These viral strategies can also result in unforeseen by-product, the pathogenicity of HTLV-1-associated diseases. In this review, with recent progress of HTLV-1 researches, we focus on astute regulation systems of the viral genes developed by HTLV-1.","['Toyoda, Kosuke', 'Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Toyoda K', 'Yasunaga JI', 'Matsuoka M']",,"['Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University of Medicine.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University of Medicine.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Uirusu,Uirusu,0417475,,IM,,,,,2019/01/01 00:00,2019/01/01 00:01,['2020/09/17 05:38'],"['2020/09/17 05:38 [entrez]', '2019/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.2222/jsv.69.37 [doi]'],ppublish,Uirusu. 2019;69(1):37-46. doi: 10.2222/jsv.69.37.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The basis for relapse of advanced lymphoid malignancies remains incompletely understood and may involve escape from the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect. We hypothesized that for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with allo-HSCT, leukemic cell-intrinsic features influence transplant outcomes by directing the evolutionary trajectories of CLL cells. Integrated genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic analyses of CLL cells from 10 patients revealed that the clinical kinetics of post-HSCT relapse are shaped by distinct molecular dynamics. Early relapses after allo-HSCT exhibited notable genetic stability; single CLL cell transcriptional analysis demonstrated a cellular heterogeneity that was static over time. In contrast, CLL cells relapsing late after allo-HSCT displayed notable genetic evolution and evidence of neoantigen depletion, consistent with marked single-cell transcriptional shifts that were unique to each patient. We observed a greater rate of epigenetic change for late relapses not seen in early relapses or relapses after chemotherapy alone, suggesting that the selection pressures of the GvL bottleneck are unlike those imposed by chemotherapy. No selective advantage for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loss was observed, even when present in pretransplant subpopulations. Gain of stem cell modules was a common signature associated with leukemia relapse regardless of posttransplant relapse kinetics. These data elucidate the biological pathways that underlie GvL resistance and posttransplant relapse.","['Bachireddy, Pavan', 'Ennis, Christina', 'Nguyen, Vinhkhang N', 'Gohil, Satyen H', 'Clement,

To identify potential mechanisms of B-ALL-driven bone destruction, we examined the p53 (-/-); Rag2 (-/-); Prkdc(scid/scid) triple mutant (TM) mice and p53 (-/-); Prkdc(scid/scid) double mutant (DM) mouse models of spontaneous B-ALL. In contrast to DM animals, leukemic TM mice displayed brittle bones, and the TM leukemic cells overexpressed Rankl, encoding receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand. RANKL is a key regulator of osteoclast differentiation and bone loss. Transfer of TM leukemic cells into immunodeficient recipient mice caused trabecular bone loss. To determine whether human B-ALL can exert similar effects, we evaluated primary human B-ALL blasts isolated at diagnosis for RANKL expression and their impact on bone pathology after their transplantation into NOD.Prkdc(scid/scid)Il2rg(tm1Wjl) /SzJ (NSG) recipient mice. Primary B-ALL cells conferred bone destruction evident in increased multinucleated osteoclasts, trabecular bone loss, destruction of the metaphyseal growth plate, and reduction in adipocyte mass in these patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Treating PDX mice with the RANKL antagonist recombinant osteoprotegerin-Fc (rOPG-Fc) protected the bone from B-ALL-induced destruction even under conditions of heavy tumor burden. Our data demonstrate a critical role of the RANK-RANKL axis in causing B-ALL-mediated bone pathology and provide preclinical support for RANKL-targeted therapy trials to reduce acute and long-term bone destruction in these patients.","['Rajakumar, Sujeetha A', 'Papp, Eniko', 'Lee, Kathy K', 'Grandal, Ildiko', 'Merico, Daniele', 'Liu, Careesa C', 'Allo, Bedilu', 'Zhang, Lucia', 'Grynpas, Marc D', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Hitzler, Johann K', 'Guidos, Cynthia J', 'Danska, Jayne S']","['Rajakumar SA', 'Papp E', 'Lee KK', 'Grandal I', 'Merico D', 'Liu CC', 'Allo B', 'Zhang L', 'Grynpas MD', 'Minden MD', 'Hitzler JK', 'Guidos CJ', 'Danska JS']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9340-5979', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4207-289X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3728-4401', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6496-0671', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4534-7019', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9089-8816', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1158-186X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7674-2612', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6549-4991']","['Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario M5T 3H7, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Center for Applied Genomics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario M5T 3H7, Canada.', 'Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario M5T 3H7, Canada.', 'Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario M5T 3H7, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario M5T 3H7, Canada.', 'Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1X8, Canada.', 'Program in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Program in Genetics and Genome Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario M5G 0A4, Canada. jayne.danska@sickkids.ca.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,['0 (RANK Ligand)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Osteoclasts', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', '*RANK Ligand']",,,,2020/09/18 06:00,2021/06/24 06:00,['2020/09/17 05:38'],"['2019/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/17 05:38 [entrez]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['12/561/eaba5942 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.aba5942 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2020 Sep 16;12(561). pii: 12/561/eaba5942. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aba5942.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Two key characteristics of carcinogens in which the immune system plays a central role are chronic inflammation and immunosuppression. In this systematic review, we investigated the association of chronic inflammatory and immunosuppressive outcomes with benzene, a widely used industrial chemical. Benzene has been confirmed to cause acute myeloid leukaemia and suspected to cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma, two cancers of the blood-forming system that affect immune cells. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and Embase for all relevant studies using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and selected key words. The detailed review protocol, including search strategy, was registered with PROSPERO, the international prospective register of systematic reviews (#CRD42019138611). RESULTS: Based on all human studies selected in the final review, we report new evidence of a benzene-induced immunosuppressive effect on the adaptive immune system and activation of the innate immune system to cause inflammation. In particular, benzene significantly lowers the number of white blood cells, particularly lymphocytes such as CD4(+) T-cells, B-cells and natural killer cells, and increases proinflammatory biomarkers at low levels of exposure. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review of benzene's immunotoxicity in humans. Based on results obtained from this review, we propose two potential immunotoxic mechanisms of how benzene induces leukaemia/lymphoma: (1) cancer invasion caused by proinflammatory cytokine production, and (2) cancer promotion via impaired immunosurveillance. Further studies will be required to confirm the connection between benzene exposure and its effects on the immune system.","['Guo, Helen', 'Ahn, Stacy', 'Zhang, Luoping']","['Guo H', 'Ahn S', 'Zhang L']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7866-8391'],"['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA luoping@berkeley.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200916,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,,PMC7960562,['NOTNLM'],"['benzene', 'cancer', 'environment', 'immunology', 'toxicology']",2020/09/18 06:00,2020/09/18 06:00,['2020/09/17 05:38'],"['2020/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/03/16 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/09/17 05:38 [entrez]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2020-106517 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2020-106517 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Occup Environ Med. 2020 Sep 16. pii: oemed-2020-106517. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2020-106517.,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Here, we optimized our CLL-1 CAR for anti-leukemic activity in mouse xenograft models of aggressive AML. METHODS: First, we optimized the CLL-1 CAR using different spacer, transmembrane and costimulatory sequences. We used a second retroviral vector to coexpress transgenic IL15. We measured the effects of each construct on T cell phenotype and sequential (recursive) co culture assays with tumor cell targets to determine the durability of the anti tumor activity by flow cytometry. We administered CAR T cells to mice engrafted with patient derived xenografts (PDX) and AML cell line and determined anti tumor activity by bioluminescence imaging and weekly bleeding, measured serum cytokines by multiplex analysis. After euthanasia, we examined formalin-fixed/paraffin embedded sections. Unpaired two-tailed Student's t-tests were used and values of p<0.05 were considered significant. Survival was calculated using Mantel-Cox log-rank test. RESULTS: In vitro, CLL-1 CAR T cells with interleukin-15 (IL15) were less terminally differentiated (p<0.0001) and had superior expansion compared with CD28z-CD8 CAR T cells without IL15 (p<0.001). In both AML PDX and AML cell line animal models, CLL-1 CAR T coexpressing transgenic IL15 initially expanded better than CD28z-CD8 CAR T without IL15 (p<0.0001), but produced severe acute toxicity associated with high level production of human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), IL15 and IL2. Histopathology showed marked inflammatory changes with tissue damage in lung and liver. This acute toxicity could be managed by two strategies, individually or in combination. The excessive TNF alpha secretion could be blocked with anti-TNF alpha antibody, while excessive T cell expansion could be arrested by activation of an inducible caspase nine safety switch by administration of dimerizing drug. Both strategies successfully prolonged tumor-free survival. CONCLUSION: Combinatorial treatment with a TNFalpha blocking antibody and subsequent activation of the caspase-9 control switch increased the expansion, survival and antileukemic potency of CLL-1 CAR T-cells expressing transgenic IL15 while avoiding the toxicities associated with excessive cytokine production and long-term accumulation of activated T-cells.","['Ataca Atilla, Pinar', 'McKenna, Mary K', 'Tashiro, Haruko', 'Srinivasan, Madhuwanti', 'Mo, Feiyan', 'Watanabe, Norihiro', 'Simons, Brian Wesley', 'McLean Stevens, Alexandra', 'Redell, Michele S', 'Heslop, Helen E', 'Mamonkin, Maksim', 'Brenner, Malcolm K', 'Atilla, Erden']","['Ataca Atilla P', 'McKenna MK', 'Tashiro H', 'Srinivasan M', 'Mo F', 'Watanabe N', 'Simons BW', 'McLean Stevens A', 'Redell MS', 'Heslop HE', 'Mamonkin M', 'Brenner MK', 'Atilla E']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8613-2105'],"['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Comparative Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA erdenatilla@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,"['0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-15/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",PMC7497527,['NOTNLM'],"['*adaptive immunity', '*adoptive', '*chimeric antigen', '*cytokines', '*hematologic neoplasms', '*immunotherapy', '*receptors']",2020/09/18 06:00,2021/10/15 06:00,['2020/09/17 05:37'],"['2020/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/17 05:37 [entrez]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jitc-2020-001229 [pii]', '10.1136/jitc-2020-001229 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2020 Sep;8(2). pii: jitc-2020-001229. doi: 10.1136/jitc-2020-001229.,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 have shown remarkable initial response rates in BCP-ALL patients, while long-term leukemia control rate is only about 50%. So far, main mechanisms of BCP-ALL relapse after CD19-CAR T-cell therapy have been either insufficient CAR T-cell persistence in vivo or loss of surface CD19. CASE REPORT: Here, we report an exceptional presentation of BCP-ALL relapse in the eye during the systemic control through CAR T-cell therapy. We report a case of fatal intraocular relapse in a pediatric patient with pro-B-ALL after initial response to CD19-CAR T-cell therapy. One month after CD19-CAR T-cell therapy, remission was documented by bone marrow aspirate analysis with absence of CD19(+) cells and CD19-CAR T cells could be detected in both peripheral blood and bone marrow. At the same time, however, the patient presented with progressive visual disturbance and CD19(+) cells were found within the anterior chamber of the eye. Despite local and systemic therapy, ocular relapse led to BCP-ALL dissemination and systemic relapse within weeks. The eye represents a rare site for local manifestation of BCP-ALL, but isolated intraocular relapse is a clinically unreckoned presentation of BCP-ALL in the era of CD19-CAR T cells. CONCLUSION: During systemic control of BCP-ALL through CD19-CAR T cells, relapse can emerge in the eye as an immune-privileged organ. Ocular symptoms after CD19-CAR T-cell therapy should guide the clinician to elucidate the etiology in a timely fashion in order to adjust leukemia treatment strategy. Both, local immune escape as well as insufficient CAR T-cell persistence may have contributed to relapse in the reported patient. Mechanisms of relapse in an immune desert under CAR T-cell therapy require future clinical and experimental attention. In particular, ocular symptoms after CAR T-cell therapy should be considered a potentially early sign of leukemia relapse.","['Willier, Semjon', 'Raedler, Johannes', 'Blaeschke, Franziska', 'Stenger, Dana', 'Pazos Escudero, Montserrat', 'Jurgeleit, Florian', 'Grunewald, Thomas G P', 'Binder, Vera', 'Schmid, Irene', 'Albert, Michael H', 'Wolf, Armin', 'Feuchtinger, Tobias']","['Willier S', 'Raedler J', 'Blaeschke F', 'Stenger D', 'Pazos Escudero M', 'Jurgeleit F', 'Grunewald TGP', 'Binder V', 'Schmid I', 'Albert MH', 'Wolf A', 'Feuchtinger T']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9472-2191', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8517-9681']","[""Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Bavaria, Germany."", ""Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Bavaria, Germany."", ""Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Bavaria, Germany."", ""Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Bavaria, Germany."", 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Radiotherapy, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, Munich, Germany.', ""Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Bavaria, Germany."", 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Max-Eder Research Group for Pediatric Sarcoma Biology, Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Partner site Munich, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Munich, Germany.', ""Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Bavaria, Germany."", ""Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Bavaria, Germany."", ""Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Bavaria, Germany."", 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Munich, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', ""Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Bavaria, Germany tobias.feuchtinger@med.uni-muenchen.de.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/*metabolism', 'Child, Preschool', 'Eye Diseases/*etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*metabolism']",PMC7497522,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-Lymphocytes', '*adoptive', '*chimeric antigen', '*immunotherapy', '*pediatrics', '*receptors', '*tumor escape']",2020/09/18 06:00,2021/10/15 06:00,['2020/09/17 05:37'],"['2020/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/17 05:37 [entrez]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jitc-2020-001052 [pii]', '10.1136/jitc-2020-001052 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2020 Sep;8(2). pii: jitc-2020-001052. doi: 10.1136/jitc-2020-001052.,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

However, the source of epiallele heterogeneity in AML is unknown. Herein we analyzed epiallele diversity in a genetically and clinically annotated AML cohort. Notably, AML driver mutations linked to transcription factors and favorable outcome are associated with epigenetic destabilization in a defined set of susceptible loci. In contrast, AML subtypes linked to inferior prognosis manifest greater abundance and highly stochastic epiallele patterning. We report an epiallele outcome classifier supporting the link between epigenetic diversity and treatment failure. Mouse models with TET2 or IDH2 mutations show that epiallele diversity is especially strongly induced by IDH mutations, precedes transformation to AML, and is enhanced by cooperation between somatic mutations. Furthermore, epiallele complexity was partially reversed by epigenetic therapies in AML driven by TET2/IDH2, suggesting that epigenetic therapy might function in part by reducing population complexity and fitness of AMLs. SIGNIFICANCE: We show for the first time that epigenetic clonality is directly linked to specific mutations and that epigenetic allele diversity precedes and potentially contributes to malignant transformation. Furthermore, epigenetic clonality is reversible with epigenetic therapy agents.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1775.","['Li, Sheng', 'Chen, Xiaowen', 'Wang, Jiahui', 'Meydan, Cem', 'Glass, Jacob L', 'Shih, Alan H', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Mason, Christopher E', 'Melnick, Ari M']","['Li S', 'Chen X', 'Wang J', 'Meydan C', 'Glass JL', 'Shih AH', 'Delwel R', 'Levine RL', 'Mason CE', 'Melnick AM']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9543-6274', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0663-6216', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1850-1642', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8074-2287']","['The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut. amm2014@med.cornell.edu sheng.li@jax.org.', 'The Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center, Bar Harbor, Maine.', 'The Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, The University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut.', 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center and Oncode Institute, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York. amm2014@med.cornell.edu sheng.li@jax.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200916,United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,,IM,"['Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mutation']",PMC7710625,,,2020/09/18 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2020/09/17 05:37'],"['2019/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/17 05:37 [entrez]']","['2159-8290.CD-19-0897 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-0897 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2020 Dec;10(12):1934-1949. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-0897.

However, its clinical significance in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to detect the expression level of miR-381 in pediatric AML patients and to explore its potential clinical significance. METHODS: The levels of miR-381 in bone marrow and serum of 102 pediatric AML patients were measured by quantitative real-time polymorperase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The diagnostic value of serum miR-381 in pediatric AML patients was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A Chi square test was used to analyze the relationship between serum miR-381 and the clinical characteristics of patients. Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier evaluated the prognostic value of serum miR-381 in patients. Finally, the proliferation of the cells was analyzed by the CCK-8 assay. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, the levels of miR-381 in serum and bone marrow of pediatric AML patients were significantly decreased (P < 0.001). ROC curve showed that miR-381 could distinguish pediatric AML cases from normal controls. At the same time, the downregulation of miR-381 was associated with M7 in the French-American-British (FAB) classifications and unfavorable cytogenetic risks (P < 0.05). Low serum miR-381 levels were associated with poor overall survival of pediatric AML (log-rank test, P = 0.011) and poor relapse-free survival (log-rank test, P = 0.004). Cox regression analysis confirmed that reduced serum miR-381 was an independent predictor of poor prognosis in AML (HR = 3.794, 95% CI 1.3633-10.559, P = 0.011). In addition, low expression of miR-381 significantly reduced the proliferation of cells (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: All experimental results confirm that miR-381 has reduced bone marrow and serum expression in pediatric AML, and low levels of serum miR-381 have certain diagnostic and prognostic value in pediatric AML and may be a potential therapeutic target for AML.","['Zhang, Piqiang', 'Sun, Deyun', 'Sun, Xuemei', 'Li, Hongjuan']","['Zhang P', 'Sun D', 'Sun X', 'Li H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4617-4463'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Linyi People Hospital, No. 27, East Jiefang Road, Linyi, 276003, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Linyi People Hospital, No. 27, East Jiefang Road, Linyi, 276003, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Linyi People Hospital, No. 27, East Jiefang Road, Linyi, 276003, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Linyi People Hospital, No. 27, East Jiefang Road, Linyi, 276003, Shandong, China. hongjuan_li01@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200916,England,Eur J Med Res,European journal of medical research,9517857,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN381 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/blood/*genetics/metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells']",PMC7493963,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'miR-381']",2020/09/18 06:00,2021/07/06 06:00,['2020/09/17 05:31'],"['2020/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/17 05:31 [entrez]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40001-020-00442-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s40001-020-00442-1 [pii]']",epublish,Eur J Med Res. 2020 Sep 16;25(1):42. doi: 10.1186/s40001-020-00442-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, potently and selectively inhibiting Mcl-1 to induce apoptosis has become a widely accepted anticancer strategy. OBJECTIVE: This review intends to provide a comprehensive overview of patents and primary literature, published from 2017 to present, on small molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors with various scaffolds. By analyzing the modes of compound-protein interactions, the similarities and differences of those structures are discussed, which could provide guidance for future drug design. METHODS: The primary accesses for patent searching are SciFinder and Espacenet(R). Besides the data disclosed in patents, some results published in the follow-up research papers will be included in this review. RESULTS: The review covers dozens of patents on Mcl-1 inhibitors in the past three years, and the scaffolds of compounds are mainly divided into indole scaffolds and non-indole scaffolds. The compounds described here are compared with the relevant inhibitors disclosed in previous patents, and representative compounds, especially those launched in clinical trials, are emphasized in this review. CONCLUSION: For most of the compounds in these patents, analyses of the binding affinity to Mcl-1 and studies in multiple cell lines were conducted, wherein some compounds were tested in preclinical cancer models or were included in other biological studies. Some compounds showed promising results and potential for further study.","['Fan, Ying', 'Hou, Xuben', 'Fang, Hao']","['Fan Y', 'Hou X', 'Fang H']",,"['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, 250012, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, 250012, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, 44 Wenhuaxi Road, 250012, Jinan, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Recent Pat Anticancer Drug Discov,Recent patents on anti-cancer drug discovery,101266081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Patents as Topic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Anticancer', 'Mcl-1', 'apoptosis', 'drug design', 'patent', 'selective inhibitor.']",2020/09/18 06:00,2021/09/18 06:00,['2020/09/17 05:30'],"['2020/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/17 05:30 [entrez]']","['PRA-EPUB-109964 [pii]', '10.2174/1574892815666200916124641 [doi]']",ppublish,Recent Pat Anticancer Drug Discov. 2020;15(4):306-320. doi: 10.2174/1574892815666200916124641.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The auto-inhibition regulatory module observed in the progenitor kinase c-Abl is lost in the aberrant Bcr-Abl, because of the lack of the N-myristoylated cap able to bind the myristoyl binding pocket also conserved in the Bcr-Abl kinase domain. A way to overcome the occurrence of resistance phenomena frequently observed for Bcr-Abl orthosteric drugs is the rational design of allosteric ligands approaching the so-called myristoyl binding pocket. The discovery of these allosteric inhibitors although very difficult and extremely challenging, represents a valuable option to minimize drug resistance, mostly due to the occurrence of mutations more frequently affecting orthosteric pockets, and to enhance target selectivity with lower off-target effects. In this perspective, we will elucidate at a molecular level the structural bases behind the Bcr-Abl allosteric control and will show how artificial intelligence can be effective to drive the automated de novo design towards off-patent regions of the chemical space.","['Carofiglio, Francesca', 'Trisciuzzi, Daniela', 'Gambacorta, Nicola', 'Leonetti, Francesco', 'Stefanachi, Angela', 'Nicolotti, Orazio']","['Carofiglio F', 'Trisciuzzi D', 'Gambacorta N', 'Leonetti F', 'Stefanachi A', 'Nicolotti O']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2043-7464', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9430-7972', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6533-5539']","['Dipartimento di Farmacia Scienze del Farmaco, Universita degli Studi di Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Farmacia Scienze del Farmaco, Universita degli Studi di Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy.', 'Molecular Horizon srl, Via Montelino 32, 06084 Bettona, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Farmacia Scienze del Farmaco, Universita degli Studi di Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Farmacia Scienze del Farmaco, Universita degli Studi di Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Farmacia Scienze del Farmaco, Universita degli Studi di Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Farmacia Scienze del Farmaco, Universita degli Studi di Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70125 Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200914,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (PD 166326)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation/drug effects', 'Allosteric Site', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding Sites', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical/methods/*trends', 'Drug Design', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",PMC7570842,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'allosteric inhibitors', 'artificial intelligence', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'de novo design']",2020/09/18 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2020/09/17 01:02'],"['2020/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/17 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25184210 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25184210 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Sep 14;25(18). pii: molecules25184210. doi: 10.3390/molecules25184210.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The neoplastic transformation and expansion of tumor B cells are commonly recognized as antigen-driven processes, mediated by the interaction of antigens with the B cell receptor (BCR) expressed on the surface of B-lymphocytes. The survival and progression of CLL cells largely depend on the direct interaction of CLL cells with receptors of accessory cells of tumor microenvironment. Recently, much interest has been focused on the role of tumor release of small extracellular vesicles (EVs), named exosomes, which incorporate a wide range of biologically active molecules, particularly microRNAs and proteins, which sustain the tumor growth. Here, we will review the role of CLL-derived exosomes as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of the disease.","['Nistico, Nancy', 'Maisano, Domenico', 'Iaccino, Enrico', 'Vecchio, Eleonora', 'Fiume, Giuseppe', 'Rotundo, Salvatore', 'Quinto, Ileana', 'Mimmi, Selena']","['Nistico N', 'Maisano D', 'Iaccino E', 'Vecchio E', 'Fiume G', 'Rotundo S', 'Quinto I', 'Mimmi S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3784-7446', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1221-9320', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3565-7817', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8422-2679', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5414-6190', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5441-1727', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2187-9176']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine - University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine - University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine - University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine - University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine - University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Health Sciences-University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine - University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine - University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200914,Switzerland,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",101238453,,,,PMC7557731,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'exosomes', 'miRNAs']",2020/09/18 06:00,2020/09/18 06:01,['2020/09/17 01:02'],"['2020/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/17 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/18 06:01 [medline]']","['ph13090244 [pii]', '10.3390/ph13090244 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2020 Sep 14;13(9). pii: ph13090244. doi: 10.3390/ph13090244.,,"['J18C17000610006/POR FES/FESR 2014-20-ATS ALCMEONE', '0000/GILEAD Fellowship 2018', 'MHJJ55_002/MIUR-PRIN 2017', 'AIM1897004-1/EU project PON- AIM1897004-1', '2014-2020/FSE-FESR PON-RI 2014-2020']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency of circulating monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC; defined as CD14(+)CD11b(+)CD15(-)HLA-DR(-/low) cells) was assessed in correlation with clinical and laboratory parameters characterising the disease activity and patient immune status. Samples of peripheral blood from untreated CLL patients and healthy volunteers were stained with monoclonal antibodies for flow cytometry analysis. CLL patients with M-MDSC percentages above 9.35% (according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis) had a shorter time-to-treatment and shorter survival time than the group with a lower percentage of M-MDSC. The M-MDSC percentage was higher in patients with adverse prognostic factors (i.e., 17p and 11q deletion and CD38 and ZAP-70 expression). A high M-MDSC percentage was linked to significantly lower expression of the CD3zeta in T cells. Furthermore, an analysis of immune regulatory molecules (arginase 1 (ARG1), nitric oxide synthase (NOS2), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and interleukin (IL)-10) was performed. By the means of flow cytometry and RT-qPCR, we showed an overexpression of three of them in M-MDSC of CLL patients. M-MDSC cells seem to be an important factor in the immunosuppressive microenvironment of CLL and seem to be a good and novel prognostic factor.","['Zarobkiewicz, Michal', 'Kowalska, Wioleta', 'Chocholska, Sylwia', 'Tomczak, Waldemar', 'Szymanska, Agata', 'Morawska, Izabela', 'Wojciechowska, Agnieszka', 'Bojarska-Junak, Agnieszka']","['Zarobkiewicz M', 'Kowalska W', 'Chocholska S', 'Tomczak W', 'Szymanska A', 'Morawska I', 'Wojciechowska A', 'Bojarska-Junak A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0788-6353', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0930-5874', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9462-8779', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0854-7882', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2340-9442']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, 20-080 Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, 20-080 Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, 50-370 Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200914,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7563618,['NOTNLM'],"['ARG1', 'CD3zeta', 'CLL', 'IDO', 'IL-10', 'M-MDSC', 'NOS2', 'TGF-beta']",2020/09/18 06:00,2020/09/18 06:01,['2020/09/17 01:02'],"['2020/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/17 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/18 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12092614 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12092614 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Sep 14;12(9). pii: cancers12092614. doi: 10.3390/cancers12092614.,,['DS 458/Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this retrospective study of 794 MM patients we aimed to investigate clinical features and common CA including gain(1q) in separate subgroups defined by primary CA. In the entire group, we confirmed that gain(1q) was associated with short time to next treatment and adverse overall survival (OS). The impact was worse for four or more copies of 1q21 as compared to three copies. However, in a subgroup of patients with clonal gain(11q) and without known primary IGH translocations (CG11q), already three copies of 1q21 were associated with a poor outcome; in the absence of gain(1q), patients in this subgroup had a remarkably long median OS of more than nine years. These cases were associated with HRD, coexpression of CD56 and CD117, male gender, and IgG subtype. In non-CG11q patients, four or more copies of 1q21 (but not three copies) had a significant adverse impact on outcome. Several associations with CA and clinical findings were observed for the defined subgroups. As an example, we found a predominance of early tetraploidy, plasma cell leukemia, and female gender in the t(14;16) subgroup. Our results underscore the importance of subgrouping in MM.","['Locher, Maurus', 'Steurer, Michael', 'Jukic, Emina', 'Keller, Markus A', 'Fresser, Friedrich', 'Ruepp, Carmen', 'Woll, Ewald', 'Verdorfer, Irmgard', 'Gastl, Gunther', 'Willenbacher, Wolfgang', 'Weger, Roman', 'Nachbaur, David', 'Wolf, Dominik', 'Gunsilius, Eberhard', 'Zschocke, Johannes', 'Steiner, Normann']","['Locher M', 'Steurer M', 'Jukic E', 'Keller MA', 'Fresser F', 'Ruepp C', 'Woll E', 'Verdorfer I', 'Gastl G', 'Willenbacher W', 'Weger R', 'Nachbaur D', 'Wolf D', 'Gunsilius E', 'Zschocke J', 'Steiner N']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9299-3454', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9829-1309']","['Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, St. Vinzenz Krankenhaus Betriebs GmbH, Zams, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, St. Vinzenz Krankenhaus Betriebs GmbH, Zams, Austria.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'ONCOTYROL - Center for Personalized Cancer Medicine, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'ONCOTYROL - Center for Personalized Cancer Medicine, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Medical Clinic 3, Oncology, Hematology, Immuno-Oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200919,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (NCAM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (KIT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD56 Antigen/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Genetic Loci', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic']",PMC7756645,,,2020/09/17 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/09/16 17:13'],"['2020/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/16 17:13 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25994 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Dec;95(12):1562-1571. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25994.

As such, childhood acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) survivors are at risk of HBV infection due to immunosuppression secondary to chemotherapy. However, the hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb)-seropositive rate of childhood ALL survivors after chemotherapy is unknown, and the need to revaccinate HBsAb-seronegative ALL survivors is not appreciated in China. To assess the changes in HBsAb before and after chemotherapy, we retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 547 patients treated with the Chinese Children Leukaemia Group (CCLG)-ALL 2008 protocol from 1 April 2008 to 30 August 2019. The results revealed that 416 patients (76.1%) were HBsAb-seropositive at diagnosis, and at the time of the cessation of chemotherapy, 177 patients (32.4%) were HBsAb-seropositive and 370 patients (67.6%) were HBsAb-seronegative. Interestingly, 11 patients who were HBsAb-seronegative at diagnosis converted to seropositive at the time of the cessation of chemotherapy. HBsAb titres were decreased after chemotherapy (P < 0.0001). Further, patients with higher HBsAb titres at diagnosis were more likely to maintain protective antibody titres at the completion of chemotherapy (P < 0.0001). The loss of antibody was more remarkable in younger patients (</= 10 years) both at diagnosis (P = 0.009) and at the completion of chemotherapy (P = 0.006). In summary, this study showed that 67.6% of patients were HBsAb-seronegative at the time of the cessation of chemotherapy, which indicates that ALL survivors are at high risk of HBV. As a result, HBV revaccination after chemotherapy should be highly valued in ALL survivors.","['Wang, L', 'Hu, H', 'Zhang, R', 'Zheng, X', 'Li, J', 'Lu, J', 'Zhang, Y', 'Qi, P', 'Lin, W', 'Wu, Y', 'Yu, J', 'Fan, J', 'Peng, Y', 'Zheng, H']","['Wang L', 'Hu H', 'Zhang R', 'Zheng X', 'Li J', 'Lu J', 'Zhang Y', 'Qi P', 'Lin W', 'Wu Y', 'Yu J', 'Fan J', 'Peng Y', 'Zheng H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0708-7829'],"[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics (Capital Medical University), Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education;

We report the first large-scale, community-based, health survey of HTLV-1 and its disease associations in this setting. METHODS: Aboriginal community residents aged >2 years in 7 remote communities were invited to do a health survey that included a questionnaire, spirometry, and clinical examination by a physician blinded to HTLV-1 status, clinical records, and spirometry results. Blood was drawn for HTLV-1 serology and proviral load (PVL). Pulmonary disease was assessed clinically and spirometrically and, where records were available, radiologically after the clinical assessment. Associations between specific diseases and HTLV-1 status were determined using logistic regression, adjusting for available confounders. RESULTS: Overall, 579 residents (164 children aged 3-17 years; 415 adults) were examined (37.7% of the estimated resident population). HTLV-1 prevalences for children and adults were 6.1% and 39.3%, respectively. No associations were found between HTLV-1 and any assessed clinical condition among children. Chronic pulmonary disease and gait abnormalities were more common among adults with HTLV-1 infection. Adjusted odds ratios among participants with PVL >/=1000 per 105 peripheral blood leukocytes were 7.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.67-18.74; P < .001), 9.81 (95% CI, 3.52-27.35; P < .001), and 14.4 (95% CI, 4.99-41.69; P < .001) for clinically defined chronic pulmonary disease, moderate-severe expiratory airflow limitation, and radiologically determined bronchiectasis/bronchiolitis, respectively, and 5.21 (95% CI, 1.50-18.07; P = .009) for gait abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: In the first study of HTLV-1 disease associations based on community recruitment and blinded assessment, HTLV-1 infection was strongly associated with pulmonary disease and gait abnormalities.","['Einsiedel, Lloyd', 'Pham, Hai', 'Talukder, Mohammad Radwanur R', 'Liddle, Joel', 'Taylor, Kerry', 'Wilson, Kim', 'Jersmann, Hubertus', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Woodman, Richard', 'Kaldor, John']","['Einsiedel L', 'Pham H', 'Talukder MRR', 'Liddle J', 'Taylor K', 'Wilson K', 'Jersmann H', 'Gessain A', 'Woodman R', 'Kaldor J']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2517-6083'],"['Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Alice Springs Hospital, Alice Springs, Australia.', 'Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Alice Springs Hospital, Alice Springs, Australia.', 'Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Alice Springs Hospital, Alice Springs, Australia.', 'Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute, Alice Springs Hospital, Alice Springs, Australia.', 'Poche Centre for Indigenous Health and Wellbeing, Alice Springs, Australia.', 'National Serology Reference Laboratory, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Oncogenic virus epidemiology and pathophysiology Unit, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.', 'Flinders University, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,,IM,"['Cross-Sectional Studies', '*HTLV-I Infections/complications/epidemiology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, T-Cell', '*Lung Diseases', 'Viral Load']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*HTLV-1', '*aboriginal', '*central Australia', '*gait abnormalities', '*pulmonary disease']",2020/09/17 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2020/09/16 17:12'],"['2020/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/16 17:12 [entrez]']","['5906595 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/ciaa1401 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2021 Oct 5;73(7):e1498-e1506. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciaa1401.,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

To exploit the graft-versus-leukemia effect more effectively, we assessed the feasibility of early initiation of epigenetic therapy with panobinostat and decitabine after allo-HSCT and before donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in poor-risk patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or refractory anemia with excess blasts with International Prognostic Scoring System score >/=1.5. A total of 140 poor-risk patients with AML aged 18 to 70 years were registered, and 110 proceeded to allo-HSCT. Three dose levels were evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities, including panobinostat monotherapy 20 mg at days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 4-week cycle (PNB mono group) and panobinostat combined with either decitabine 20 mg/m2 (PNB/DAC20 group) or decitabine 10 mg/m2 (PNB/DAC10 group) at days 1 to 3 of every 4-week cycle. After phase 1, the study continued as phase 2, focusing on completion of protocol treatment and treatment outcome. PNB mono and PNB/DAC10 were feasible, whereas PNB/DAC20 was not related to prolonged cytopenia. Sixty of 110 patients who underwent transplantation were eligible to receive their first DLI within 115 days after allo-HSCT. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events related to panobinostat and decitabine were observed in 23 (26%) of the 87 patients, and they received epigenetic therapy. Cumulative incidence of relapse was 35% (standard error [SE] 5), and overall survival and progression-free survival at 24 months were 50% (SE 5) and 49% (SE 5). Post-allo-HSCT epigenetic therapy with panobinostat alone or in combination with low-dose decitabine is feasible and is associated with a relatively low relapse rate.

This study aimed to estimate the global trends of leukemia-related death and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) from 1990 to 2017. METHODS: The data was acquired from the latest version of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated to estimate the trend of age-standardized rate (ASR) of death and DALYs due to leukemia and its main subtypes from 1990 to 2017. RESULTS: Globally, the numbers of death and DALYs due to leukemia were 347.58 x 10(3) (95% uncertainty interval [UI] = 317.26 x 10(3) -364.88 x 10(3) ) and 11975.35 x 10(3) (95% UI = 10749.15 x 10(3) -12793.58 x 10(3) ) in 2017, with a 31.22% and 0.03% increase in absolute numbers from 1990 to 2017, respectively. Both of their ASR showed decreasing trends from 1990 to 2017 with the EAPCs being -1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI] = (-1.10--0.99) and -1.52 (95% CI = -1.59--1.44), respectively. Globally, the most pronounced decreasing trend of death and DALYs occurred in chronic myeloid leukemia with EAPCs of -2.76 (95% CI = -2.88--2.64) and -2.84 (95% CI = -2.97--2.70), respectively, while the trend increased in acute myeloid leukemia. The death and DALYs of leukemia decreased in most areas and countries with high socio-demographic index (SDI) including Bahrain, Finland, and Australia. CONCLUSIONS: The disease burden of death and DALYs due to leukemia decreased globally, and for most regions and countries from 1990 to 2017. However, the leukemia burden is still a substantial challenge globally and required adequate and affordable medical resources to improve the survival and quality of life of leukemia patients.","['Ou, Zejin', 'Yu, Danfeng', 'Liang, Yuanhao', 'He, Wenqiao', 'Li, Yongzhi', 'Zhang, Minyi', 'You, Fangfei', 'He, Huan', 'Chen, Qing']","['Ou Z', 'Yu D', 'Liang Y', 'He W', 'Li Y', 'Zhang M', 'You F', 'He H', 'Chen Q']",,"['Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510515, P.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a slowly progressive clonal malignant disease, and a myeloproliferative disorder which is derived from biphasic hematopoietic stem cells but driven by progenitor cells. AML following CML is common, which can be caused by an antecedent myeloid malignancy, leukemogenic therapy, or without an identifiable prodrome or exposure to cytotoxic agents. However, the case of secondary chronic myeloid leukemia following acute myeloid leukemia treated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is rare. METHODS: Here we report a unique case of secondary CML after AML treated by chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. The 34-year-old male was diagnosed with AML subtype M5b according to clinical features in 2011. The patient was treated with the MAE program (mitoxantrone, cytosine arabinoside, etoposide) for two courses, followed by the IAE program (idarubicin, cytosine arabinoside, etoposide) and cytosine arabinoside for consolidation chemotherapy. An autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate cytarabine and dexamethasone was initiated. RESULTS: Subsequently, the patient achieved complete remission in 2012. After 4 years, the patient presented with leukocyte elevation of more than 4 months, and then was diagnosed with secondary CML. Based on this diagnosis, and with respect to the patient's severely compromised overall condition, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy was conducted in 2016. The patient achieved, and continue to be in, complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: The case expands the understanding of secondary CML and emphasizes the importance of oncological vigilance in patients with secondary CML after AML therapy.","['Cheng, Jing', 'Liao, Yaping', 'Bin, Ting', 'OUYang, Juan', 'Chen, Shaoqian', 'Chen, Xueyan', 'Zou, Waiyi']","['Cheng J', 'Liao Y', 'Bin T', 'OUYang J', 'Chen S', 'Chen X', 'Zou W']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Eight Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The People's Hospital of Longhua Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200929,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*TKI', '*autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*chronic myeloid leukemia']",2020/09/17 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2020/09/16 12:13'],"['2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/16 12:13 [entrez]']",['10.1080/03007995.2020.1808452 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2020 Nov;36(11):1807-1812. doi: 10.1080/03007995.2020.1808452.

LIF is added to the mouse stem cells culture medium, and its removal results in fast differentiation. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is one of the most used solvents in drug test. We exposed 4-day mESC cultures to different concentrations of DMSO (0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0%) to identify the safest dose exhibiting efficacy as a solvent. mESCs grown under general pluripotency conditions in the absence of LIF were treated with DMSO. In addition, as a control for differentiation, mESCs were grown in the absence of LIF. DMSO upregulated the mRNA expression level of pluripotency markers. Moreover, DMSO reduced the mRNA expression levels of ectodermal marker (beta-tubulin3), mesodermal marker (Hand1), and endodermal markers (Foxa2 and Sox17) in mESCs. These results indicate that DMSO treatment enhances the pluripotency and disrupts the differentiation of mESCs. We also show that members of the Tet oncogene family are critical to inhibiting the differentiation and methylation of mESCs. DMSO is appropriate to sustain the pluripotency of mESCs in the absence of LIF, and that mESCs can be sustained in an undifferentiated state using DMSO. Therefore, DMSO may, in part, function as a substitute for LIF.","['Yi, Jun-Koo', 'Park, Song', 'Ha, Jae-Jung', 'Kim, Dae-Hyun', 'Huang, Hai', 'Park, Si-Jun', 'Lee, Mee-Hyun', 'Ryoo, Zae-Young', 'Kim, Sung-Hyun', 'Kim, Myoung-Ok']","['Yi JK', 'Park S', 'Ha JJ', 'Kim DH', 'Huang H', 'Park SJ', 'Lee MH', 'Ryoo ZY', 'Kim SH', 'Kim MO']",,"['Department of Embryo Transfer Research, Gyeongbuk Livestock Research Institute, Yeongju, Korea.', 'Core Protein Resources Center, DGIST, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Embryo Transfer Research, Gyeongbuk Livestock Research Institute, Yeongju, Korea.', 'Department of Embryo Transfer Research, Gyeongbuk Livestock Research Institute, Yeongju, Korea.', 'Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, College of Korean Medicine, Dongshin University, Naju, Korea.', 'Department of Life Science Analysis, Korea Polytechnics University, Nonsan, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, College of Korean Medicine, Dongshin University, Naju, Korea.', 'Department of Animal Science and Biotechnology, School of Animal BT Sciences Kyungpook National University, Sangju, Korea.', 'Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea.', 'China-US (Henan) Hormel Cancer Institute, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200916,United States,Cell Reprogram,Cellular reprogramming,101528176,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*DMSO', '*LIF', '*mESCs', '*pluripotency markers']",2020/09/17 06:00,2021/07/23 06:00,['2020/09/16 12:13'],"['2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/16 12:13 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cell.2020.0006 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Reprogram. 2020 Oct;22(5):244-253. doi: 10.1089/cell.2020.0006.

METHODS: The in-vitro culture of N. brasiliensis was established and maintained in the laboratory, and the third- (L3) and fifth-stage larvae (L5) were collected under a sterile condition for preparation of L3 and L5 proteins. The in-vitro culture of THP-1 cells was established, stimulated with 500 ng/mL PMA to yield M0 macrophages that were adherent to the plate wall. The LPS + IFN-gamma group, IL-4 + IL-13 group, L3 protein group and L5 protein group were given stimulation with 500 ng/mL LPS plus 100 ng/mL IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-13 (both 100 ng/mL), L3 protein (5 mg/mL) and L5 protein (5 mg/mL), respectively, while the negative control group was given no stimulation. The cell morphology was observed using microscopy, the mRNA expression of M1/M2 macrophages-specific genes was quantified using a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay, and the surface markers of M1/M2 macrophages were detected using flow cytometry, while the levels of cytokines secreted by M1/M2 macrophages were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) following stimulations, so as to examine the polarization of THP-1-derived macrophages induced by N. brasiliensis proteins in vitro. RESULTS: Following stimulation with PMA, THP-1 cells appeared wall-adherent M0 macrophages, and polarized to typical M1 macrophages following stimulation with LPS + IFN-gamma, and typical M2 macrophages following stimulation with IL-4 + IL-13, IL-3 protein or L5 protein. There was a significant difference in the proportion of M1 macrophages among the negative control group, the LPS + IFN-gamma group, the IL-4 + IL-13 group, the L3 protein group and the L5 protein group (chi(2) = 3 721.00, P < 0.001), with the highest proportion detected in the LPS + IFN-gamma group, and there was also a significant difference in the proportion of M2 macrophages among groups (chi(2) = 105.43, P < 0.001). There were significant differences among groups in terms of the mRNA expression of CCL2 (F = 191.95, P < 0.001), TNF-alpha (F = 129.95, P < 0.001), IL-12b (F = 82.89, P < 0.001), PPARgamma (F = 11.30, P < 0.001), IL-10 (F = 9.51, P < 0.001) and Mrc1 genes (F = 12.35, P < 0.001). In addition, there were significant differences in the proportion of positive CD86 and CD206 expression among groups (chi(2) = 24 004.33 and 832.50, P < 0.001). Higher IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels were measured in the LPS + IFN-gamma group than in the IL-4 + IL-13 group, the L3 protein group and the L5 protein group (P < 0.001), and greater TGF-beta1 and IL-10 levels were seen in the IL-4 + IL-13 group, the L3 protein group and the L5 protein group than in the negative control group and the LPS + IFN-gamma group (P < 0.05).

In this rare case of relapse in the cervix of the uterus, Pap smears alarmed physicians, and radiology examinations assisted the diagnostic workup. Still, only biopsy, microscopic evaluation, and immunohistochemistry studies established the exact diagnosis. Prognosis in the situation of extramedullary disease relapse in the female genital tract was poor, but gynecologists' high suspicion led to a prompt diagnosis.

The prognosis of pediatric AML has been improved in recent decades, but it trails that of most other types of pediatric cancer, with mortality rates of 30-40%. Consequently, newer more targeted drugs are required for incorporation into treatment plans. These newer drugs selectively target AML cells with specific gene alterations. However, there are significant differences in genetic alterations between adult and pediatric patients with AML. In the present study, inexpensive and rapid next-generation sequencing (NGS) of >150 cancer-related genes was performed for matched diagnostic, remission and relapse (if any) samples from 27 pediatric patients with AML. In this analysis, seven genes were recurrently mutated. KRAS was mutated in seven patients, NRAS was mutated in three patients, and KIT, GATA1, WT1, PTPN11, JAK3 and FLT3 were each mutated in two patients. Among patients with relapsed AML, six harbored KRAS mutations at diagnosis; however, four of these patients lost these mutations at relapse. Additionally, two genetic alterations (FLT3-ITD and TP53 alterations) were detected among patients who eventually relapsed, and these mutations are reported to be adverse prognostic factors for adult patients with AML. This panel-based, targeted sequencing approach may be useful in determining the genetic background of pediatric AML and improving the prediction of treatment response and detection of potentially targetable gene alterations. RAS pathway mutations were highly unstable at relapse; therefore, these mutations should be chosen as a target with caution. Incorporating this panel-based NGS approach into the clinical setting may allow for a patient-oriented strategy of precision treatment for childhood AML.","['Ishida, Hisashi', 'Iguchi, Akihiro', 'Aoe, Michinori', 'Nishiuchi, Ritsuo', 'Matsubara, Takehiro', 'Keino, Dai', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Shimada, Akira']","['Ishida H', 'Iguchi A', 'Aoe M', 'Nishiuchi R', 'Matsubara T', 'Keino D', 'Sanada M', 'Shimada A']",,"['Department of Pediatrics/Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-8648, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Support, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kochi Health Sciences Center, Kochi 781-8555, Japan.', 'Division of Biobank, Center for Comprehensive Genomic Medicine, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, St. Marianna University School of Medicine Hospital, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 216-8511, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Aichi 460-0001, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics/Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200828,England,Biomed Rep,Biomedical reports,101613227,,,,PMC7469563,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'leukemia', 'molecular genetics', 'pediatric', 'precision medicine']",2020/09/17 06:00,2020/09/17 06:01,['2020/09/16 05:39'],"['2020/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 05:39 [entrez]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/br.2020.1353 [doi]', 'BR-0-0-01353 [pii]']",ppublish,Biomed Rep. 2020 Nov;13(5):46. doi: 10.3892/br.2020.1353.

Previous studies have shown that DS individuals have a unique cancer profile. While exhibiting low solid tumor prevalence, DS patients are at risk for hematologic cancers, such as acute megakaryocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We speculated that endothelial cells are active players in this clinical background. To this end, we hypothesized that impaired DS endothelial development and functionality, impacted by genome-wide T21 alterations, potentially results in a suboptimal endothelial microenvironment with the capability to prevent solid tumor growth. To test this hypothesis, we assessed molecular and phenotypic differences of endothelial cells differentiated from Down syndrome and euploid iPS cells. Microarray, RNA-Seq, and bioinformatic analyses revealed that most significantly expressed genes belong to angiogenic, cytoskeletal rearrangement, extracellular matrix remodeling, and inflammatory pathways. Interestingly, the majority of these genes are not located on Chromosome 21. To substantiate these findings, we carried out functional assays. The obtained phenotypic results correlated with the molecular data and showed that Down syndrome endothelial cells exhibit decreased proliferation, reduced migration, and a weak TNF-alpha inflammatory response. Based on this data, we provide a set of genes potentially associated with Down syndrome's elevated leukemic incidence and its unfavorable solid tumor microenvironment-highlighting the potential use of these genes as therapeutic targets in translational cancer research.","['Perepitchka, Mariana', 'Galat, Yekaterina', 'Beletsky, Igor P', 'Iannaccone, Philip M', 'Galat, Vasiliy']","['Perepitchka M', 'Galat Y', 'Beletsky IP', 'Iannaccone PM', 'Galat V']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', ""Developmental Biology Program, Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute, Ann & Robert H.

The molecular basis underlying the pathogenesis of SET-NUP214 and DEK-NUP214 are still poorly understood, but both chimeras inhibit protein nuclear export mediated by the beta-karyopherin CRM1. In this report, we show that SET-NUP214 and DEK-NUP214 both disturb the localization of proteins essential for nucleocytoplasmic transport, in particular for CRM1-mediated protein export. Endogenous and exogenous SET-NUP214 and DEK-NUP214 form nuclear bodies. These nuclear bodies disperse upon targeted inhibition of CRM1 and the two fusion proteins re-localize throughout the nucleoplasm. Moreover, SET-NUP214 and DEK-NUP214 nuclear bodies reestablish shortly after removal of CRM1 inhibitors. Likewise, cell viability, metabolism, and proliferation of leukemia cell lines harboring SET-NUP214 and DEK-NUP214 are compromised by CRM1 inhibition, which is even sustained after clearance from CRM1 antagonists. Our results indicate CRM1 as a possible therapeutic target in NUP214-related leukemia. This is especially important, since no specific or targeted treatment options for NUP214 driven leukemia are available yet.","['Mendes, Adelia', 'Juhlen, Ramona', 'Martinelli, Valerie', 'Fahrenkrog, Birthe']","['Mendes A', 'Juhlen R', 'Martinelli V', 'Fahrenkrog B']",,"['Institute of Molecular Biology and Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Charleroi 6041, Belgium.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Charleroi 6041, Belgium.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen 52074, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Charleroi 6041, Belgium.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Charleroi 6041, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200908,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC7486696,['NOTNLM'],"['CRM1', 'NUP214', 'leukemia', 'nuclear export', 'nucleoporin']",2020/09/17 06:00,2020/09/17 06:01,['2020/09/16 05:39'],"['2020/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 05:39 [entrez]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27711 [doi]', '27711 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2020 Sep 8;11(36):3371-3386. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27711. eCollection 2020 Sep 8.,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of linalool in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) remains unclear. In the present study, human T-ALL cell lines (Jurkat, H9, Molt-4 and Raji cells) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors were treated with various concentrations of linalool (3.75, 7.50, 15.00, 30.00, 60.00 and 120.00 microM, respectively). A CCK-8 assay was used to analyse cell viability and it demonstrated that linalool inhibited the growth of T-ALL cells in a dose-dependent manner, but did not significantly affect normal PBMCs. Flow cytometry was used to detect the cell cycle and apoptosis and demonstrated that linalool reduced the percentage of T-ALL cells at the G0/G1 phase, and induced the apoptosis of T-ALL cells. RNA sequencing was conducted on an Illumina HiSeq X Series 2500 before and after treatment with linalool followed by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis. It was demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was involved in the effect of linalool on T-ALL cells. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting were performed to verify the mRNA and protein levels, respectively of the genes in the signaling pathway identified. In addition, it was found that linalool significantly inhibited phosphorylated (p)-ERK1/2 protein expression and enhanced p-JNK protein expression of T-ALL cells. In conclusion, the present study revealed that linalool inhibits T-ALL cell survival with involvement of the MAPK signaling pathway. JNK activation and ERK inhibition may play a functional role in apoptosis induction of T-ALL cells. Linalool may be developed as a novel anti T-ALL agent.","['Gong, Xubo', 'Wang, Baiyong', 'Yan, Lijuan', 'Lu, Xiaoya', 'Zhao, Xiaoying']","['Gong X', 'Wang B', 'Yan L', 'Lu X', 'Zhao X']",,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zheijang 310000, P.R.

The present study was designed to explore the regulatory effects of microRNA (miR)-19a on the proliferation and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells, and its influence on the activation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. The expression of miR-19a in adult SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cells was downregulated via lentiviral transfection, and the cells were divided into a control group, NC-inhibitor group and miR-19a-inhibitor group. The expression of miR-19a in each group was detected via quantitative polymerase Chain reaction (qPCR). Next, the cell proliferation and apoptosis levels in each group were detected via methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and flow cytometry, respectively, and the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells was further determined. Moreover, the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway-related proteins were detected through western blotting. The expression level of miR-19a in the miR-19a-inhibitor group was significantly lower than that in the control group and NC-inhibitor group (P<0.01). Downregulation of miR-19a significantly reduced the proliferation ability (P<0.01), increased the apoptosis level of SaOS-2 cells (P<0.01), and significantly increased the ROS level in cells (P<0.01). Downregulation of miR-19a also promote cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3 expression in the OS cells (P<0.01) and inhibited Bcl-2/Bax expression (P<0.01). Additionally, downregulation of miR-19a markedly lowered the protein expression levels of phosphorylated (p-)JAK2, p-STAT3 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) in the cells (P<0.01). To conclude, downregulation of miR-19a can inhibit the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in SaOS-2 cells, promote the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, and increase the ROS level in cells, thereby promoting apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation.","['Chen, Jiangqiang', 'Chen, Zuhui']","['Chen J', 'Chen Z']",,"[""Department of Traumatology, Tiantai People's Hospital, Tiantai, Zhejiang 317200, P.R.

Findings from FILO group trials (CLL2007FMP, CLL2007SA, CLL2010FMP) enabled investigation of the prognostic value of high-sensitivity (0.7 x 10(-5)) MRD assessment using flow cytometry, in blood (N = 401) and bone marrow (N = 339), after fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR)-based chemoimmunotherapy in a homogeneous population with long follow-up (median 49.5 months). Addition of low-level positive MRD < 0.01% to MRD >/= 0.01% increased the proportion of cases with positive MRD in blood by 39% and in bone marrow by 27%. Compared to low-level positive MRD < 0.01%, undetectable MRD was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) when using blood (72.2 versus 42.7 months; hazard ratio 0.40, p = 0.0003), but not when using bone marrow. Upon further stratification, positive blood MRD at any level, compared to undetectable blood MRD, was associated with shorter PFS irrespective of clinical complete or partial remission, and a lower 5-year PFS rate irrespective of IGHV-mutated or -unmutated status (all p < 0.05). In conclusion, high-sensitivity (0.0007%) MRD assessment in blood yielded additional prognostic information beyond the current standard sensitivity (0.01%). Our approach provides a model for future determination of the optimal MRD investigative strategy for any regimen.","['Letestu, Remi', 'Dahmani, Abdelmalek', 'Boubaya, Marouane', 'Baseggio, Lucile', 'Campos, Lydia', 'Chatelain, Bernard', 'Debliquis, Agathe', 'Drenou, Bernard', 'Jacob, Marie-Christine', 'Legac, Eric', 'Le Garff-Tavernier, Magali', 'Lhoumeau, Anne-Catherine', 'Quiney, Claire', 'Robillard, Nelly', 'Ticchioni, Michel', 'Aanei, Carmen', 'Katsahian, Sandrine', 'Delepine, Roselyne', 'Vaudaux, Sandrine', 'Rouille, Valerie', 'Bene, Marie-Christine', 'Dartigeas, Caroline', 'Van Den Neste, Eric', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Feugier, Pierre', 'Cartron, Guillaume', 'Leblond, Veronique', 'Levy, Vincent', 'Cymbalista, Florence']","['Letestu R', 'Dahmani A', 'Boubaya M', 'Baseggio L', 'Campos L', 'Chatelain B', 'Debliquis A', 'Drenou B', 'Jacob MC', 'Legac E', 'Le Garff-Tavernier M', 'Lhoumeau AC', 'Quiney C', 'Robillard N', 'Ticchioni M', 'Aanei C', 'Katsahian S', 'Delepine R', 'Vaudaux S', 'Rouille V', 'Bene MC', 'Dartigeas C', 'Van Den Neste E', 'Lepretre S', 'Feugier P', 'Cartron G', 'Leblond V', 'Levy V', 'Cymbalista F']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2437-2656', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2175-6785', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9205-0624']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, APHP CHU Avicenne, Bobigny, France. remi.letestu@aphp.fr."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, APHP CHU Avicenne, Bobigny, France."", 'URC, APHP CHU Avicenne, Bobigny, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hospices Civils de Lyon/Groupement Hospitalier Sud, Lyon, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU Saint Etienne, Saint Etienne, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU UCL Namur, Yvoir, Belgium."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, GHRMSA, Mulhouse, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, GHRMSA, Mulhouse, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, CHU Grenoble-Alpes, Grenoble-Alpes, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHR Orleans, Orleans, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, APHP CHU Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, IPC, Marseille, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, APHP CHU Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU Nantes, Nantes, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, CHU L'Archet, Nice, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU Saint Etienne, Saint Etienne, France."", 'URC, CHU Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'CHU Tours, Tours, France.', 'CLCC, Rouen, France.', 'CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU Nantes, Nantes, France."", 'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Tours, Tours, France.', 'Hematologie Clinique, UCLouvain, Louvain, Belgium.', 'Hematologie Clinique, CLCC, Rouen, France.', 'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Nancy, Nancy, France.', 'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Hematologie clinique, APHP CHU Pitie-Salpetriere, Sorbonne Universite Paris, Paris, France.', 'URC/CRC, APHP CHU Avicenne, Bobigny, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, APHP CHU Avicenne, Bobigny, France. florence.cymbalista@aphp.fr.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200915,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,,,2020/09/17 06:00,2021/08/17 06:00,['2020/09/16 05:36'],"['2020/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/16 05:36 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-01009-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-01009-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Jun;35(6):1597-1609. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-01009-z.

Nearly 20 years ago, NK cell-mediated immunotherapy emerged as a safe and effective treatment approach for patients with advanced-stage leukaemia. Subsequently, the field of NK cell-based cancer therapy has grown exponentially and currently constitutes a major area of immunotherapy innovation. In general, the development of NK cell-directed therapies has two main focal points: optimizing the source of therapeutic NK cells for adoptive transfer and enhancing NK cell cytotoxicity and persistence in vivo. A wide variety of sources of therapeutic NK cells are currently being tested clinically, including haploidentical NK cells, umbilical cord blood NK cells, stem cell-derived NK cells, NK cell lines, adaptive NK cells, cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells and chimeric antigen receptor NK cells. A plethora of methods to augment the cytotoxicity and longevity of NK cells are also under clinical investigation, including cytokine-based agents, NK cell-engager molecules and immune-checkpoint inhibitors. In this Review, we highlight the variety of ways in which diverse NK cell products and their auxiliary therapeutics are being leveraged to target human cancers.

The innate immune systems of these immensely abundant, anciently diverged mammals remain insufficiently characterized. While bat genomes contain many endogenous retroviral elements indicative of past exogenous infections, little is known about restrictions to extant retroviruses. Here, we describe a major postentry restriction in cells of the yinpterochiropteran bat Pteropus alecto Primate lentiviruses (HIV-1, SIVmac) were potently blocked at early life cycle steps, with up to 1,000-fold decreases in infectivity. The block was specific, because nonprimate lentiviruses such as equine infectious anemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus were unimpaired, as were foamy retroviruses. Interspecies heterokaryons demonstrated a dominant block consistent with restriction of incoming viruses. Several features suggested potential TRIM5 (tripartite motif 5) or myxovirus resistance protein 2 (MX2) protein restriction, including postentry action, cyclosporine sensitivity, and reversal by capsid cyclophilin A (CypA) binding loop mutations. Viral nuclear import was significantly reduced, and this deficit was substantially rescued by cyclosporine treatment. However, saturation with HIV-1 virus-like particles did not relieve the restriction at all. P. alecto TRIM5 was inactive against HIV-1 although it blocked the gammaretrovirus N-tropic murine leukemia virus. Despite major divergence in a critical N-terminal motif required for human MX2 activity, P. alecto MX2 had anti-HIV activity. However, this did not quantitatively account for the restriction and was independent of and synergistic with an additional CypA-dependent restriction. These results reveal a novel, specific restriction to primate lentiviruses in the Pteropodidae and advance understanding of bat innate immunity.IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic suggests that bat innate immune systems are insufficiently characterized relative to the medical importance of these animals. Retroviruses, e.g., HIV-1, can be severe pathogens when they cross species barriers, and bat restrictions corresponding to retroviruses are comparatively unstudied. Here, we compared the abilities of retroviruses from three genera (Lentivirus, Gammaretrovirus, and Spumavirus) to infect cells of the large fruit-eating bat P. alecto and other mammals. We identified a major, specific postentry restriction to primate lentiviruses. HIV-1 and SIVmac are potently blocked at early life cycle steps, but nonprimate lentiviruses and foamy retroviruses are entirely unrestricted. Despite acting postentry and in a CypA-dependent manner with features reminiscent of antiretroviral factors from other mammals, this restriction was not saturable with virus-like particles and was independent of P. alecto TRIM5, TRIM21, TRIM22, TRIM34, and MX2. These results identify a novel restriction and highlight cyclophilin-capsid interactions as ancient species-specific determinants of retroviral infection.","['Morrison, James H', 'Miller, Caitlin', 'Bankers, Laura', 'Crameri, Gary', 'Wang, Lin-Fa', 'Poeschla, Eric M']","['Morrison JH', 'Miller C', 'Bankers L', 'Crameri G', 'Wang LF', 'Poeschla EM']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2752-0535', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1598-5415']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong, Australia.', 'Programme in Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA eric.poeschla@cuanschutz.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200915,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilin A)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Aotidae', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Chiroptera/*immunology/virology', 'Cyclophilin A/metabolism', 'Ferrets', 'Gammaretrovirus/growth & development/*immunology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*immunology', 'Lentiviruses, Primate/growth & development/*immunology', 'Mice', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Spumavirus/growth & development/*immunology', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins/metabolism']",PMC7492736,['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV-1', '*MX2', '*Megachiroptera', '*Pteropus alecto', '*Yinpterchiroptera', '*bats', '*cyclophilin A', '*lentivirus', '*restriction factor', '*restriction factors', '*retrovirus']",2020/09/17 06:00,2020/09/29 06:00,['2020/09/16 05:33'],"['2020/09/16 05:33 [entrez]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.01854-20 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.01854-20 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2020 Sep 15;11(5). pii: mBio.01854-20. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01854-20.,['Copyright (c) 2020 Morrison et al.'],"['DP1 DA043915/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI077344/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to find the most cost-effective way to screen for asymptomatic B-LPD. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: A lymphocytosis screening project was conducted at a large-scale hospital among the Chinese population. PARTICIPANTS: For 10 consecutive working days in 2018, 22 809 adult patients who received a complete blood count (CBC) were reviewed. These patients were selected from the outpatient, inpatient and health examination departments of a National Medical Centre in China. RESULTS: A total of 254 patients (1.1%, 254/22 809) were found to have lymphocytosis (absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) >3.5x10(9)/L). Among them, a population of circulating monoclonal B-lymphocytes were detected in 14 patients, with 4 having chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and 10 having MBL, indicating an overall prevalence of 5.5% for B-LPD (3.9% for MBL). The prevalence of CLL among the elderly patients with lymphocytosis (>/=60 years) was determined to be 4.3% (4/92). In the patients over 60 years of age, the prevalence of MBL was found to be 8.7%. CD5 (-) non-CLL-like MBL was observed to be the most common subtype (8, 80%), followed by CLL-like phenotype (1, 10.0%) and atypical CLL phenotype (1, 10.0%). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the CBC results revealed that the ALC of 4.7x10(9)/L may serve as the optimal and cost-effective cut-off for screening for early-stage asymptomatic B-LPD. CONCLUSION: In Chinese patients with lymphocytosis, there was a relatively high proportion of patients with CLL among individuals over 60 years of age. MBL is an age-related disorder. Non-CLL-like MBL was the most common MBL subtype, almost all of whom displayed a pattern of 'marginal zone lymphoma (MZL)-like' MBL. Lymphocytosis screening among the elderly would be effective in the detection of B-LPD and MBL.","['Xu, Jiadai', 'Li, Jing', 'Wei, Zheng', 'Wang, Yue', 'Liu, Peng']","['Xu J', 'Li J', 'Wei Z', 'Wang Y', 'Liu P']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9639-6606'],"['Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China liu.peng@zs-hospital.sh.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200915,England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', '*Lymphocytosis/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged']",PMC7493108,['NOTNLM'],"['*health services administration and management', '*leukaemia', '*lymphoma']",2020/09/17 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/16 05:32'],"['2020/09/16 05:32 [entrez]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2019-036006 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036006 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2020 Sep 15;10(9):e036006. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036006.,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

As a key regulator of genome organization, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) has been characterized as a DNA-binding protein with important functions in maintaining the topological structure of chromatin and inducing DNA looping. Among the prolific binding sites in the genome, several events with altered CTCF occupancy have been reported as associated with effects in physiology or disease. However, hitherto there is no comprehensive survey of genome-wide CTCF binding patterns across different human cancers. RESULTS: To dissect functions of CTCF binding, we systematically analyze over 700 CTCF ChIP-seq profiles across human tissues and cancers and identify cancer-specific CTCF binding patterns in six cancer types. We show that cancer-specific lost and gained CTCF binding events are associated with altered chromatin interactions, partially with DNA methylation changes, and rarely with sequence mutations. While lost bindings primarily occur near gene promoters, most gained CTCF binding events exhibit enhancer activities and are induced by oncogenic transcription factors. We validate these findings in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines and patient samples and show that oncogenic NOTCH1 induces specific CTCF binding and they cooperatively activate expression of target genes, indicating transcriptional condensation phenomena. CONCLUSIONS: Specific CTCF binding events occur in human cancers. Cancer-specific CTCF binding can be induced by other transcription factors to regulate oncogenic gene expression. Our results substantiate CTCF binding alteration as a functional epigenomic signature of cancer.","['Fang, Celestia', 'Wang, Zhenjia', 'Han, Cuijuan', 'Safgren, Stephanie L', 'Helmin, Kathryn A', 'Adelman, Emmalee R', 'Serafin, Valentina', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Eagen, Kyle P', 'Gaspar-Maia, Alexandre', 'Figueroa, Maria E', 'Singer, Benjamin D', 'Ratan, Aakrosh', 'Ntziachristos, Panagiotis', 'Zang, Chongzhi']","['Fang C', 'Wang Z', 'Han C', 'Safgren SL', 'Helmin KA', 'Adelman ER', 'Serafin V', 'Basso G', 'Eagen KP', 'Gaspar-Maia A', 'Figueroa ME', 'Singer BD', 'Ratan A', 'Ntziachristos P', 'Zang C']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4812-3627'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', ""Oncohematology Laboratory, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", ""Oncohematology Laboratory, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Italian Institute for Genomic Medicine, 10060, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Center for Public Health Genomics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'UVA Cancer Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA. panos.ntz@northwestern.edu.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA. panos.ntz@northwestern.edu.', 'Robert H.

Disease resistance or relapse after successful initial therapy and declining efficacy of subsequent rounds of treatment were the basis for the development of alternative anti-CD20-based antibody therapies. AREAS COVERED: The novel anti-CD20 antibodies of atumumab, ublituximab, and obinutuzumab were developed to be differentiated via structural and mechanistic features over rituximab. We provide an overview of preclinical and clinical data, and demonstrate ways in which the pharmacodynamic properties of these novel agents translate into clinical benefit for patients. EXPERT OPINION: Of the novel anti-CD20 antibodies, only obinutuzumab has shown consistently improved efficacy over rituximab in randomized pivotal trials in indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Phase 3 GALLIUM trial demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival with obinutuzumab-based immunochemotherapy over rituximab-based immunochemotherapy. Novel combinations of obinutuzumab, including with chemotherapy-free options are being explored, such as with the newly approved combinations of obinutuzumab with venetoclax, ibrutinib, or acalabrutinib. The biggest unmet need remains in the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; emerging options in this field include the use of CAR-T cells and T-cell bispecific antibodies.","['Klein, Christian', 'Jamois, Candice', 'Nielsen, Tina']","['Klein C', 'Jamois C', 'Nielsen T']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7594-7280'],"['Roche Pharma Research & Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Zurich , Schlieren, Switzerland.', 'Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Roche Pharma Research and Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Basel , Basel, Switzerland.', 'Product Development Oncology, F.

It is commonly associated with endometriosis, which has been shown to alter endometrial expression patterns. Therefore, the candidate genes identified in endometriosis could serve as a source to study endometrial function in adenomyosis. METHODS: Transcripts/proteins associated with endometrial receptivity in women with adenomyosis or endometriosis and healthy women were obtained from publications and their nomenclature was adopted according to the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC). Retrieved genes were analysed for enriched pathways using Cytoscape/Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) and Reactome tools to prioritise candidates for endometrial receptivity. These were used for validation on women with (n = 9) and without (n = 13) adenomyosis. RESULTS: Functional enrichment analysis of 173, 42 and 151 genes associated with endometriosis, adenomyosis and healthy women, respectively, revealed signalling by interleukins and interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signalling pathways, from which annotated LIF, JUNB, IL6, FOS, IL10 and SOCS3 were prioritised. Selected genes showed downregulated expression levels in adenomyosis compared to the control group, but without statistical significance. CONCLUSION: This is the first integrative study providing putative candidate genes and pathways characterising endometrial receptivity in women with adenomyosis in comparison to healthy women and women with endometriosis.","['Prasnikar, Erika', 'Kunej, Tanja', 'Knez, Jure', 'Repnik, Katja', 'Potocnik, Uros', 'Kovacic, Borut']","['Prasnikar E', 'Kunej T', 'Knez J', 'Repnik K', 'Potocnik U', 'Kovacic B']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0465-1762', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3543-5920', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1624-9428']","['Department of Reproductive Medicine and Gynaecological Endocrinology, University Medical Centre Maribor, 2000 Maribor, Slovenia.', 'Department of Animal Science, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, 1230 Domzale, Slovenia.', 'Department of Gynaecologic and Breast Oncology, University Medical Centre Maribor, 2000 Maribor, Slovenia.', 'Centre for Human Molecular Genetics and Pharmacogenomics, Medical faculty, University of Maribor, 2000 Maribor, Slovenia.', 'Centre for Human Molecular Genetics and Pharmacogenomics, Medical faculty, University of Maribor, 2000 Maribor, Slovenia.', 'Laboratory for Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, University of Maribor, 2000 Maribor, Slovenia.', 'Department of Reproductive Medicine and Gynaecological Endocrinology, University Medical Centre Maribor, 2000 Maribor, Slovenia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200911,Switzerland,Biomolecules,Biomolecules,101596414,"['0 (FOS protein, human)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (IL13 protein, human)', '0 (IL4 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (JunB protein, human)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Adenomyosis/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Endometriosis/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Endometrium/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Interleukin-10/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-13/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC7563201,['NOTNLM'],"['*adenomyosis', '*candidate genes', '*endometrial receptivity', '*endometriosis', '*gene expression', '*gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)', '*multi-omics', '*protein-protein interaction network (PPIN)']",2020/09/17 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/09/16 01:02'],"['2020/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['biom10091311 [pii]', '10.3390/biom10091311 [doi]']",epublish,Biomolecules. 2020 Sep 11;10(9). pii: biom10091311. doi: 10.3390/biom10091311.,,"['P3-0327/Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS/International', 'P4-0220/Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trim28 plays an important role in establishing this silencing, but less is known about the role other Trim proteins play. The Tif1 family is a sub-group of the Trim family, which possess histone binding ability in addition to the distinctive RING domain. Here, we have examined the interaction between three Tif1 family members, namely Trim24, Trim28 and Trim33, and their function in retroviral silencing. We identify a complex formed in ESC, comprised of these three proteins. We further show that when Trim33 is depleted, the complex collapses and silencing efficiency of both endogenous and exogenous sequences is reduced. Similar transcriptional activation takes place when Trim24 is depleted. Analysis of the H3K9me3 chromatin modification showed a decrease in this repressive mark, following both Trim24 and Trim33 depletion. As Trim28 is an identified binding partner of the H3K9 methyltransferase ESET, this further supports the involvement of Trim28 in the complex. The results presented here suggest that a complex of Tif1 family members, each of which possesses different specificity and efficiency, contributes to the silencing of retroviral sequences in ESC.","['Margalit, Liad', 'Strauss, Carmit', 'Tal, Ayellet', 'Schlesinger, Sharon']","['Margalit L', 'Strauss C', 'Tal A', 'Schlesinger S']",,"['Department of Animal Sciences, The Robert H.

AML has a very poor 5-year survival rate of just 16% in the UK; hence, more efficacious, tolerable, and targeted therapy is required. Persistent leukemia stem cell (LSC) populations underlie patient relapse and development of resistance to therapy. Identification of critical oncogenic signaling pathways in AML LSC may provide new avenues for novel therapeutic strategies. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, is often hyperactivated in AML, required to sustain the oncogenic potential of LSCs. Growing evidence suggests that targeting key components of this pathway may represent an effective treatment to kill AML LSCs. Despite this, accruing significant body of scientific knowledge, PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors have not translated into clinical practice. In this article, we review the laboratory-based evidence of the critical role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in AML, and outcomes from current clinical studies using PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors. Based on these results, we discuss the putative mechanisms of resistance to PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition, offering rationale for potential candidate combination therapies incorporating PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors for precision medicine in AML.","['Darici, Salihanur', 'Alkhaldi, Hazem', 'Horne, Gillian', 'Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Marmiroli, Sandra', 'Huang, Xu']","['Darici S', 'Alkhaldi H', 'Horne G', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Marmiroli S', 'Huang X']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4663-4191', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6706-199X']","[""Haemato-Oncology/Systems Medicine Group, Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0ZD, UK."", 'Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 41124 Modena, Italy.', ""Haemato-Oncology/Systems Medicine Group, Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0ZD, UK."", ""Haemato-Oncology/Systems Medicine Group, Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0ZD, UK."", ""Haemato-Oncology/Systems Medicine Group, Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0ZD, UK."", 'Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 41124 Modena, Italy.', ""Haemato-Oncology/Systems Medicine Group, Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 0ZD, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200911,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,PMC7563273,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'LSC', 'PI3K/Akt', 'combination treatment strategy', 'drug resistance', 'mTOR', 'targeted therapy']",2020/09/17 06:00,2020/09/17 06:01,['2020/09/16 01:01'],"['2020/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/17 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9092934 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9092934 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Sep 11;9(9). pii: jcm9092934. doi: 10.3390/jcm9092934.,,"['19186/AIRCRAFT', '105614/Z/14/Z/the Wellcome Trust', '2016/JGF/0005/Leukaemia UK', ""SC040922/the Howat Foundation and Friends of Paul O'Gorman""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Major components of their cargo are lipids, proteins, RNA, DNA, and non-coding RNAs. The miRNAs carried within exosomes reveal real-time information regarding disease status in leukemia and other cancers, and therefore exosomes have been studied as novel biomarkers for cancer. We investigated the impact of exosomes on cell proliferation in pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (PALL) and its reversal by silencing of exo-miR-181a. We isolated exosomes from the serum of PALL patients (Exo-PALL) and conditioned medium of leukemic cell lines (Exo-CM). We found that Exo-PALL promotes cell proliferation in leukemic B cell lines by gene regulation. This exosome-induced cell proliferation is a precise event with the up-regulation of proliferative (PCNA, Ki-67) and pro-survival genes (MCL-1, and BCL2) and suppression of pro-apoptotic genes (BAD, BAX). Exo-PALL and Exo-CM both show over expression of miR-181a compared to healthy donor control exosomes (Exo-HD). Specific silencing of exosomal miR-181a using a miR-181a inhibitor confirms that miR-181a inhibitor treatment reverses Exo-PALL/Exo-CM-induced leukemic cell proliferation in vitro. Altogether, this study suggests that exosomal miR-181a inhibition can be a novel target for growth suppression in pediatric lymphatic leukemia.","['Haque, Shabirul', 'Vaiselbuh, Sarah R']","['Haque S', 'Vaiselbuh SR']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6721-0630'],"['Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, 350 Community Drive, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.', 'Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, 350 Community Drive, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Staten Island University Hospital, Northwell Health, 475 Seaview Ave, Staten Island, NY 10305, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200911,Switzerland,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",101238453,,,,PMC7558769,['NOTNLM'],"['exosomes', 'leukemia', 'miRNA silencing']",2020/09/17 06:00,2020/09/17 06:01,['2020/09/16 01:01'],"['2020/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/17 06:01 [medline]']","['ph13090241 [pii]', '10.3390/ph13090241 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2020 Sep 11;13(9). pii: ph13090241. doi: 10.3390/ph13090241.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vitamin D (VITD) deficiency has been suggested to alter SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and the course of disease. Thus, we aimed to investigate associations of VITD status to disease presentation within the CovILD registry. This prospective, multicenter, observational study on long-term sequelae includes patients with COVID-19 after hospitalization or outpatients with persistent symptoms. Eight weeks after PCR confirmed diagnosis, a detailed questionnaire, a clinical examination, and laboratory testing, including VITD status, were evaluated. Furthermore, available laboratory specimens close to hospital admission were used to retrospectively analyze 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels at disease onset. A total of 109 patients were included in the analysis (60% males, 40% females), aged 58 +/- 14 years. Eight weeks after the onset of COVID-19, a high proportion of patients presented with impaired VITD metabolism and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. PTH concentrations were increased in patients who needed intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, while VITD levels were not significantly different between disease severity groups. Low VITD levels at disease onset or at eight-week follow-up were not related to persistent symptom burden, lung function impairment, ongoing inflammation, or more severe CT abnormalities. VITD deficiency is frequent among COVID-19 patients but not associated with disease outcomes. However, individuals with severe disease display a disturbed parathyroid-vitamin-D axis within their recovery phase. The proposed significance of VITD supplementation in the clinical management of COVID-19 remains elusive.","['Pizzini, Alex', 'Aichner, Magdalena', 'Sahanic, Sabina', 'Bohm, Anna', 'Egger, Alexander', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Kurz, Katharina', 'Widmann, Gerlig', 'Bellmann-Weiler, Rosa', 'Weiss, Gunter', 'Tancevski, Ivan', 'Sonnweber, Thomas', 'Loffler-Ragg, Judith']","['Pizzini A', 'Aichner M', 'Sahanic S', 'Bohm A', 'Egger A', 'Hoermann G', 'Kurz K', 'Widmann G', 'Bellmann-Weiler R', 'Weiss G', 'Tancevski I', 'Sonnweber T', 'Loffler-Ragg J']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0709-2158'],"['Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Central Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Central Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Klinikum Grosshadern, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Radiology, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Christian Doppler Laboratory for Iron Metabolism and Anemia Research, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Infectious Diseases, Pneumology, Rheumatology, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20200911,Switzerland,Nutrients,Nutrients,101521595,"['0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'A288AR3C9H (25-hydroxyvitamin D)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Betacoronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus Infections/*blood/complications/virology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nutritional Status', 'Pandemics', 'Parathyroid Hormone/blood', 'Pneumonia, Viral/*blood/complications/virology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Vitamin D Deficiency/blood/epidemiology/*virology']",PMC7551662,['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'PTH', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'VITD', 'parathyroid hormone', 'vitamin D']",2020/09/17 06:00,2020/09/25 06:00,['2020/09/16 01:01'],"['2020/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['nu12092775 [pii]', '10.3390/nu12092775 [doi]']",epublish,Nutrients. 2020 Sep 11;12(9). pii: nu12092775. doi: 10.3390/nu12092775.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Restoring the aberrant apoptotic pathways is an emerging strategy for cancer radiotherapy. In this study, we determined that targeting cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) radiosensitized colorectal cancer (CRC) cells through mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic signaling. CDC20 was overexpressed in CRC cells and upregulated after radiation. Inhibiting CDC20 activities genetically or pharmacologically suppressed the proliferation and increased radiation-induced DNA damage and intrinsic apoptosis in CRC cells. Mechanistically, knockdown of CDC20 suppressed the expression of antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 but not other Bcl-2 family proteins. The expressions of CDC20 and Mcl-1 respond to radiation simultaneously through direct interaction, as evidenced by immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays. Subsequently, decreased Mcl-1 expression inhibited the expression level of phosphorylated checkpoint kinase 1 (p-Chk1), thereby resulting in impaired DNA damage repair through downregulating the homologous recombination repair protein Rad51 and finally causing apoptotic signaling. In addition, both CDC20 and Chk1 inhibitors together, through in vivo studies, confirmed the radiosensitizing effect of CDC20 via inhibiting Mcl-1 and p-Chk1 expression. In summary, our results indicate that targeting CDC20 is a promising strategy to improve cancer radiotherapy.","['Gao, Yang', 'Wen, Pengbo', 'Chen, Bin', 'Hu, Guanshuo', 'Wu, Lijun', 'Xu, An', 'Zhao, Guoping']","['Gao Y', 'Wen P', 'Chen B', 'Hu G', 'Wu L', 'Xu A', 'Zhao G']",,"['Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology and Pollution Control Technology, Hefei 230031, China.', 'School of Graduate Students, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of Medical Informatics, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221004, China.', 'Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology and Pollution Control Technology, Hefei 230031, China.', 'School of Graduate Students, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China.', 'Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology and Pollution Control Technology, Hefei 230031, China.', 'School of Graduate Students, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China.', 'Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology and Pollution Control Technology, Hefei 230031, China.', 'Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology and Pollution Control Technology, Hefei 230031, China.', 'Key Laboratory of High Magnetic Field and Ion Beam Physical Biology, Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology and Pollution Control Technology, Hefei 230031, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200912,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Cdc20 Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '156288-95-8 (CDC20 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cdc20 Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1/*genetics', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Rad51 Recombinase/genetics', 'Radiation Tolerance/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",PMC7555290,['NOTNLM'],"['CDC20', 'Mcl-1', 'mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway', 'p-Chk1', 'radiotherapy']",2020/09/17 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/09/16 01:01'],"['2020/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 01:01 [entrez]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21186692 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21186692 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Sep 12;21(18). pii: ijms21186692. doi: 10.3390/ijms21186692.,,"['31870845/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '11835014/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '31601124/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Boehmeria nivea (Linn.) Gaudich is a natural herb in the nettle family Urticaceae that possesses numerous pharmacological properties. Despite the various pharmacological benefits of Boehmeria nivea, its effects on allergic inflammation have not yet been determined. Here, we investigated the effect of the ethanol extract of Boehmeria nivea (BNE) on degranulation rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 mast cells stimulated with anti-dinitrophenyl (anti-DNP) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) during immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic immune response. The results showed inhibition of the release of beta-hexosaminidase and histamine from the cells. BNE suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, Interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6) and reduced T helper (Th)2 cytokine IL-4 expression and/or secretion correlated with the downregulation of p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways in treated RBL-2H3 mast cells. In passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, treatment with BNE during IgE-mediated local allergic reaction triggered a reduction in mouse ear pigmentation and thickness. Taken together, these results indicated that BNE suppressed mast cell-mediated inflammation, suggesting that BNE might be a candidate for the treatment of various allergic disorders.","['Lim, Ji-Ye', 'Lee, Ji-Hyun', 'Lee, Bo-Ri', 'Kim, Mi Ae', 'Lee, Young-Mi', 'Kim, Dae-Ki', 'Choi, Jin Kyeong']","['Lim JY', 'Lee JH', 'Lee BR', 'Kim MA', 'Lee YM', 'Kim DK', 'Choi JK']",,"['Department of Immunology and Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical School, Jeonbuk (Chonbuk) National University, Jeonju, Jeonbuk 54907, Korea.', 'Department of Immunology and Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical School, Jeonbuk (Chonbuk) National University, Jeonju, Jeonbuk 54907, Korea.', 'Department of Oriental Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy and Wonkwang-Oriental Medicines Research Institute, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 54538, Korea.', 'Department of Third Medicine, Professional Graduate School of Korean Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 54538, Korea.', 'Department of Oriental Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy and Wonkwang-Oriental Medicines Research Institute, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeonbuk 54538, Korea.', 'Department of Immunology and Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical School, Jeonbuk (Chonbuk) National University, Jeonju, Jeonbuk 54907, Korea.', 'Department of Immunology and Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical School, Jeonbuk (Chonbuk) National University, Jeonju, Jeonbuk 54907, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200912,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)']",IM,"['Anaphylaxis/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/pharmacology', 'Boehmeria/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Histamine/chemistry', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Hypersensitivity/*drug therapy', 'Immunoglobulin E/chemistry', 'Inflammation/*drug therapy', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'NF-kappa B/*drug effects', 'Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis/drug effects', 'Pigmentation', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Rats', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/chemistry', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/chemistry']",PMC7570717,['NOTNLM'],"['Boehmeria nivea', 'allergic inflammation', 'cytokines', 'immunoglobulin E', 'mast cells']",2020/09/17 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/09/16 01:00'],"['2020/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 01:00 [entrez]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25184178 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25184178 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Sep 12;25(18). pii: molecules25184178. doi: 10.3390/molecules25184178.,,"['NRF-2019R1F1A1061198/National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry', 'of Education, Science and Technology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Factors contributing to this growth include massive industrial pollution, especially from large-scale petrochemical industry complexes (PICs). Globally, around 700 PICs are continuously operating. Data on the impact of PICs on leukemia incidence and mortality in residents are sparse and inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between residential exposure to PICs and leukemia incidence and mortality using systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The studies were identified through seven databases (Clinical Key, Cochrane Library, EBSCOhost, Embase, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science). We screened the eligibility of studies using following criteria: (1) observational studies that focused on residential exposure to PICs; (2) exposure group that was defined as residents living close to PICs; (3) outcome that was defined as all leukemia incidence and mortality; and (4) available population data. We applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation to assess the certainty of evidence. The random-effects model used to estimate the pooled effects in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identified thirteen epidemiologic studies (including eleven for leukemia incidence, one for leukemia mortality, and one for both), covering 125,580 individuals from Croatia, Finland, Italy, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We found moderate certainty of evidence indicated the risk of leukemia incidence (relative risk [RR] = 1.18; 95% CI = 1.03-1.35) and mortality (RR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.10-1.45) in residents living close to PICs. Our subgroup analysis found increased RRs for leukemia incidence in studies using distance-based exposure indicator (RR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.00-1.23), and with longer follow-up periods (RR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.06-1.45). CONCLUSION: Our analysis provides low-certainty evidence of increased leukemia incidence and moderate-certainty evidence of increased leukemia mortality among residents living close to PICs. While the global petrochemicals sector is growing, our findings suggest the need to consider disease prevention and pollution control measures during the development of PICs.","['Boonhat, Hathaichon', 'Lin, Ro-Ting']","['Boonhat H', 'Lin RT']",,"['Graduate Institute of Public Health, College of Public Health, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.', 'Department of Occupational Safety and Health, College of Public Health, China Medical University, Taichung 406, Taiwan.

Virus neutralization tests are a gold standard serological diagnostic, but requirements for large volumes of serum and high biosafety containment can limit widespread use. Here, focusing on Rabies lyssavirus, a globally important zoonosis, we developed a pseudotype micro-neutralization rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (pmRFFIT) that overcomes these limitations. Specifically, we adapted an existing micro-neutralization test to use a green fluorescent protein-tagged murine leukaemia virus pseudotype in lieu of pathogenic rabies virus, reducing the need for specialized reagents for antigen detection and enabling use in low-containment laboratories. We further used statistical models to generate rapid, quantitative predictions of the probability and titre of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies from microscopic imaging of neutralization outcomes. Using 47 serum samples from domestic dogs with neutralizing antibody titres estimated using the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVN), pmRFFIT showed moderate sensitivity (78.79%) and high specificity (84.62%). Despite small conflicts, titre predictions were correlated across tests repeated on different dates both for dog samples (r = 0.93) and in a second data set of sera from wild common vampire bats (r = 0.72, N = 41), indicating repeatability. Our test uses a starting volume of 3.5 microl of serum, estimates titres from a single dilution of serum rather than requiring multiple dilutions and end point titration, and may be adapted to target neutralizing antibodies against alternative lyssavirus species. The pmRFFIT enables high-throughput detection of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies in low-biocontainment settings and is suited to studies in wild or captive animals where large serum volumes cannot be obtained.","['Meza, Diana K', 'Broos, Alice', 'Becker, Daniel J', 'Behdenna, Abdelkader', 'Willett, Brian J', 'Viana, Mafalda', 'Streicker, Daniel G']","['Meza DK', 'Broos A', 'Becker DJ', 'Behdenna A', 'Willett BJ', 'Viana M', 'Streicker DG']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9796-6706', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7593-1000', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4315-8628', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8912-3266', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5975-6505', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7475-2705']","['Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Medical Research Council, University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, UK.', 'Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Medical Research Council, University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, UK.', 'Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA.', 'Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Medical Research Council, University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, UK.', 'Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Medical Research Council, University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200923,Germany,Transbound Emerg Dis,Transboundary and emerging diseases,101319538,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/*blood', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Dog Diseases/*blood', 'Dogs', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/chemistry', 'Neutralization Tests/instrumentation/*veterinary', 'Rabies/blood/*veterinary', 'Rabies virus/*isolation & purification']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Desmodus rotundus', 'biologic assay', 'generalized linear mixed models', 'immunofluorescence']",2020/09/16 06:00,2021/06/17 06:00,['2020/09/15 17:15'],"['2020/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/15 17:15 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tbed.13826 [doi]'],ppublish,Transbound Emerg Dis. 2021 May;68(3):1564-1576. doi: 10.1111/tbed.13826.

The identification of targeted, more effective, safer drugs is thus desirable. We performed a high-throughput drug-screening assay of 1280 compounds and identified thioridazine (TDZ), a drug that was highly selective for the t(6;11)(q27;q23) MLL-AF6 (6;11)AML rearrangement, which mediates a dramatically poor (below 20%) survival rate. TDZ induced cell death and irreversible progress toward the loss of leukemia cell clonogenic capacity in vitro. Thus, we explored its mechanism of action and found a profound cytoskeletal remodeling of blast cells that led to Ca2+ influx, triggering apoptosis through mitochondrial depolarization, confirming that this latter phenomenon occurs selectively in t(6;11)AML, for which AF6 does not work as a cytoskeletal regulator, because it is sequestered into the nucleus by the fusion gene. We confirmed TDZ-mediated t(6;11)AML toxicity in vivo and enhanced the drug's safety by developing novel TDZ analogues that exerted the same effect on leukemia reduction, but with lowered neuroleptic effects in vivo. Overall, these results refine the MLL-AF6 AML leukemogenic mechanism and suggest that the benefits of targeting it be corroborated in further clinical trials.","['Tregnago, Claudia', 'Da Ros, Ambra', 'Porcu, Elena', 'Benetton, Maddalena', 'Simonato, Manuela', 'Simula, Luca', 'Borella, Giulia', 'Polato, Katia', 'Minuzzo, Sonia', 'Borile, Giulia', 'Cogo, Paola', 'Campello, Silvia', 'Massi, Alessandro', 'Romagnoli, Romeo', 'Buldini, Barbara', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Pigazzi, Martina']","['Tregnago C', 'Da Ros A', 'Porcu E', 'Benetton M', 'Simonato M', 'Simula L', 'Borella G', 'Polato K', 'Minuzzo S', 'Borile G', 'Cogo P', 'Campello S', 'Massi A', 'Romagnoli R', 'Buldini B', 'Locatelli F', 'Pigazzi M']",,"['Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Laboratory, Department of Woman and Child Health, and.', 'Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Laboratory, Department of Woman and Child Health, and.', 'Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Laboratory, Department of Woman and Child Health, and.', 'Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Laboratory, Department of Woman and Child Health, and.', 'Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Unit, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'PCare Laboratory, Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica, Fondazione Citta della Speranza, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Laboratory, Department of Woman and Child Health, and.', 'Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Laboratory, Department of Woman and Child Health, and.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Onco-hematology, Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica, Fondazione Citta della Speranza, Padua, Italy.', 'Division of Pediatrics, Department of Medicine, Udine University, Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Science, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy; and.', 'Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Science, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy; and.', 'Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Laboratory, Department of Woman and Child Health, and.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS), Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", 'Haematology-Oncology Clinic and Laboratory, Department of Woman and Child Health, and.', 'Department of Onco-hematology, Istituto di Ricerca Pediatrica, Fondazione Citta della Speranza, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (MLL-AF6 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'N3D6TG58NI (Thioridazine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium', 'Cell Death', 'Child', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', '*Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Thioridazine', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC7509857,,,2020/09/16 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/15 17:14'],"['2020/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/15 17:14 [entrez]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31523-8 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002001 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Sep 22;4(18):4417-4429. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002001.,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous clinical pharmacogenetic studies suggested that NFATC2 is associated with the risk of hypersensitivity reactions to the chemotherapeutic agent L-asparaginase (ASNase) that worsen outcomes during the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We therefore hypothesized that the genetic inhibition of NFATC2 would protect against the development of anti-ASNase antibodies and ASNase hypersensitivity. Our study demonstrates that ASNase-immunized NFATC2-deficient mice are protected against ASNase hypersensitivity and develop lower antigen-specific and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels compared with wild-type (WT) controls. Furthermore, ASNase-immunized NFATC2-deficient mice develop more CD4+ regulatory T cells, fewer CD4+ interleukin-4-positive (IL-4+) cells, higher IL-10/TGF-beta1 levels, and lower IL-4/IL-13 levels relative to WT mice. Basophils and peritoneal mast cells from ASNase-immunized, but not naive, NFATC2-deficient mice had lower FcepsilonRI expression and decreased IgE-mediated mast cell activation than WT mice. Furthermore, ASNase-immunized, but not naive, NFATC2-deficient mice developed less severe shock than WT mice after induction of passive anaphylaxis or direct histamine administration. Thus, inhibition of NFATC2 protects against ASNase hypersensitivity by impairing T helper 2 responses, which may provide a novel strategy for attenuating hypersensitivity and the development of antidrug antibodies, including to ASNase.","['Rathod, Sanjay', 'Ramsey, Manda', 'Finkelman, Fred D', 'Fernandez, Christian A']","['Rathod S', 'Ramsey M', 'Finkelman FD', 'Fernandez CA']",,"['Center for Pharmacogenetics and.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.', 'Center for Pharmacogenetics and.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.', 'Division of Immunology, Allergy and Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH; and.', ""Division of Immunobiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", 'Center for Pharmacogenetics and.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nfatc2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/therapeutic use', '*Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Transcription Factors']",PMC7509855,,,2020/09/16 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/15 17:14'],"['2020/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/15 17:14 [entrez]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31522-6 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002478 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Sep 22;4(18):4406-4416. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002478.,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],['R01 CA216815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the 10-year records of hematological disorders among patients' NIBD clinics from year 2006 to 2015. All cases of aplastic anemia (AA), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) were categorized on the basis of the seasons in which they were diagnosed such as winter (December-February), spring (March-May), southwest monsoon periods (June-September), and retreating monsoon period (October and November). Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS and STATA. Inferential statistics were explored using the chi-square test for heterogeneity to evaluate seasonal variations. P-value <0.05 was taken as significant. RESULTS: A total of 1982 cases were reviewed. Men were predominantly higher (n = 1190, 60%) as compared to women (n = 792, 40%). Frequency of ALL was found to be higher (513, 25.9%), followed by ITP (504, 25.4%), AML (490, 24.7%), AA (396, 20%), while APML was observed in only 79 (4%) patients. Seasonal variations in the diagnosis of hematological disorders were observed (P-value < .001), except in APML diagnosis (P-value = .445). Significant seasonal variations were also detected in both genders in stratified analysis. CONCLUSION: The finding of this study has reported an increase in the hematological disorder during 2006 to 2015. Particularly, majority of the cases were reported in southwest monsoon period, whereas least cases were reported in retreating period. Significant seasonal and yearly variations were detected in all diagnosis except the APML.","['Hassan, Jawad', 'Adil, Syed Omair', 'Haider, Zeeshan', 'Zaheer, Sidra', 'Anwar, Nida', 'Nadeem, Muhammad', 'Ansari, Saqib Hussain', 'Shamsi, Tahir']","['Hassan J', 'Adil SO', 'Haider Z', 'Zaheer S', 'Anwar N', 'Nadeem M', 'Ansari SH', 'Shamsi T']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9670-4576', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2287-3895']","['National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'National Institute of Blood Disease and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200915,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Seasons', 'Sex Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'aplastic anemia', 'immune thrombocytopenic purpura', 'seasonal variations']",2020/09/16 06:00,2021/05/07 06:00,['2020/09/15 12:18'],"['2020/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/15 12:18 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13337 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2021 Feb;43(1):93-98. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13337.

No specific genetic abnormalities are present in CMML, and reactive monocytosis should be excluded. An increase in classical monocytes (MO1) has been suggested as a screening tool for CMML. METHODS: We evaluated monocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of patients with CMML (n = 16), patients with reactive monocytosis (n = 19), and normal controls (n = 15) with flow cytometry using antibodies against CD14, CD16, CD56, CD24, CD45, and CD2. The cutoff of MO1 >/=94% was validated, and the optimal cutoff was analyzed with receiver operating curve analysis. RESULTS: The sensitivity of monocyte subset testing for screening for CMML was 0.938 (0.717-0.997), and the specificity was 0.882 (0.734 - 0.953) using the cutoff of MO1 >/=94%. Serial samples from patients who responded to hypomethylating therapy showed an MO1 < 94%. However, few patients with reactive monocytosis, including patients with nonhematologic malignancies and acute myeloid leukemia, showed an increase in the MO1 >/= 94%. Monocyte subset results were correlated with the response to hypomethylating therapy in follow-up samples. CONCLUSION: Monocyte subset analysis is useful in screening for and monitoring CMML. Harmonization of the protocols for monocyte subset analysis is required.","['Hwang, Sang Mee', 'Ahn, Haejin', 'Jeon, Seungah', 'Park, Jun', 'Chang, Yunye', 'Kim, Hyungsuk']","['Hwang SM', 'Ahn H', 'Jeon S', 'Park J', 'Chang Y', 'Kim H']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3390-1932', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0574-9200']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200915,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*classification/*cytology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",PMC7843289,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'monocyte subset', 'screening tests']",2020/09/16 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2020/09/15 12:17'],"['2020/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/15 12:17 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcla.23576 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2021 Jan;35(1):e23576. doi: 10.1002/jcla.23576.

We found that BCAT1 plays an important role in the progression of myeloid leukaemia, and a method for the analysis of intracellular alpha-keto acids including branched-chain keto acids was necessary to further investigate their role. In this study, we developed a method to analyze six alpha-keto acids (alpha-ketoglutaric acid (KG), pyruvic acid, alpha-ketobutyric acid, alpha-ketoisovaleric acid, alpha-ketoisocaproic acid, and alpha-keto-beta-methylvaleric acid) in K562 cells by HPLC with fluorescence detection, using 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB) as a derivatization reagent. Because split peaks of DMB-KG were observed when injection samples were too acidic, the derivatization solution was diluted with NaOH solution to obtain a single peak. Limits of detection and limits of quantification were 1.3-5.4 nM and 4.2-18 nM, respectively. Intracellular concentrations of alpha-keto acids were 1.55-316 pmol/1 x 106 K562 cells. The developed method realized reproducible and sensitive analysis of intracellular alpha-keto acids. Thus, the method could be used to elucidate the role of BCAT in myeloid leukaemia.","['Fujiwara, Takuya', 'Hattori, Ayuna', 'Ito, Takahiro', 'Funatsu, Takashi', 'Tsunoda, Makoto']","['Fujiwara T', 'Hattori A', 'Ito T', 'Funatsu T', 'Tsunoda M']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9596-5988'],"['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan. makotot@mol.f.u-tokyo.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.', 'Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, University of Georgia, Athens 30602, USA.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan. makotot@mol.f.u-tokyo.ac.jp.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan. makotot@mol.f.u-tokyo.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anal Methods,Analytical methods : advancing methods and applications,101519733,"['0 (Amino Acids, Branched-Chain)', '0 (Keto Acids)', '0 (Ketoglutaric Acids)', '8558G7RUTR (Pyruvic Acid)']",IM,"['*Amino Acids, Branched-Chain', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', '*Keto Acids', 'Ketoglutaric Acids', 'Pyruvic Acid']",,,,2020/09/16 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/15 08:53'],"['2020/09/15 08:53 [entrez]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/d0ay00556h [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Methods. 2020 May 28;12(20):2555-2559. doi: 10.1039/d0ay00556h.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis of white blood cells (WBCs) permits us to detect the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a type of blood cancer that causes fatality when untreated. At present, the morphological analysis of blood cells is performed manually by skilled operators, which holds numerous drawbacks. The manual techniques for leukemia detection are time-consuming and show less accurate results. Hence, there is a need for an automatic method for detecting leukemia. In order to overcome the demerits associated with the manual methods of counting and classifying, an automatic method of blast cell counting and leukemia classification is progressed. This paper proposes a leukemia detection method, using the Gini index-based Fuzzy Naive Bayes (GFNB) classifier that is the integration of Gini index and Fuzzy Naive Bayes classifier. Initially, the input multi-cell blood smear image is subjected to pre-processing, and the blast cell is segmented using the adaptive thresholding. Then, the blast cells are counted using the proposed classifier so as to decide the presence of leukemia for the effective diagnosis. Experimental analysis using the ALL-IDB1 database confirms that the proposed method operates better than the existing methods in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity that are found to be 0.9591, 0.9599, and 1, respectively. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method is reliable and accurate. Also, the proposed system can help the physicians to improve and speed up their process.Graphical abstract Leukemia is caused by the excess production of the immature leucocytes in the bone marrow that expose the human body to lose the tendency to fight against the diseases. Leukemia classification is highly needed as in the later stage, failure of the diagnosis steps may lead to the death of the person. Moreover, some countries do not have any study against the diagnosis steps of leukemia and it highly exists among the low-income people. In order to analyze the type of leukemia and to provide an effective diagnosis strategy, the paper presents a fast and highly accurate classification method. The main aim of the paper is to propose a method to perform the leukemia classification through the segmentation and classification of the WBC cells using the multi-cell blood smear images. The major steps involved in the leukemia classification are pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The input blood smear image is enhanced in the pre-processing step and the pre-processed image is subjected to segmentation using the LUV color transformation and Adaptive Thresholding strategy. The features are extracted from the individual segments and they are presented to the classifier for the classification. The features extracted are shape, texture, and count of the blast cells, for which the grid-based shape extraction, local gradient pattern (LGP)-based texture features, and pixel threshold-based counting of the blast cells are employed. The proposed classifier is developed using the Gini index and Fuzzy Naive Bayes classifier.","['Das, Biplab Kanti', 'Dutta, Himadri Sekhar']","['Das BK', 'Dutta HS']",,"['Calcutta Institute of Technology, Howrah, West Bengal, India. bkdmca118@gmail.com.', 'Kalyani Government Engineering College, Kalyani, West Bengal, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200915,United States,Med Biol Eng Comput,Medical & biological engineering & computing,7704869,,IM,"['Bayes Theorem', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Hematologic Tests/*methods', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Leukemia/*blood/diagnosis', 'Leukocytes/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Blast cell identification', 'Blood smear image', 'Fuzzy Naive Bayes', 'Gini index', 'Leukemia classification']",2020/09/16 06:00,2021/08/12 06:00,['2020/09/15 05:49'],"['2019/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/15 05:49 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11517-020-02249-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11517-020-02249-y [pii]']",ppublish,Med Biol Eng Comput. 2020 Nov;58(11):2789-2803. doi: 10.1007/s11517-020-02249-y.

Research in adult cancer patients suggests that patient-reported symptoms may predict survival, but the relationship between symptoms and relapse for pediatric ALL has received little attention. METHODS: Pediatric patients with ALL (age 2-18 years) and/or their primary caregivers completed symptom surveys at the end of induction, start of delayed intensification (DI), start of maintenance cycle 1 (MC1), and start of maintenance cycle 2 (MC2). Symptom clusters for co-occurring fatigue, pain, sleep disruptions, and nausea were defined using latent profile analysis. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between symptom clusters, individual symptoms, and subsequent relapse were calculated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for clinical and demographic factors. RESULTS: Eligible patients (n = 208) were followed an average of 2.6 years for the incidence of relapse (n = 22). Associations between relapse and symptoms were identified for fatigue at DI (HR = 1.83, 95%CI 1.23-2.73) and MC1 (HR = 2.14, 95%CI 1.62-2.84), pain at DI (HR = 1.80, 95%CI 1.19-2.72), nausea at the end of induction (HR = 1.19, 95%CI 1.01-1.39), and sleep disturbances at the end of induction (HR = 2.00, 95%CI 1.11-3.62), DI (HR = 1.73, 95%CI 1.01-2.96), and MC1 (HR = 2.19, 95%CI 1.10-4.35). Symptom clusters comprised of individuals with a higher average symptom burden at DI were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with relapse. CONCLUSION: Patient-reported symptoms may provide prognostic information to aid in the identification of pediatric ALL patients at increased risk of relapse.","['Brown, Austin L', 'Raghubar, Kimberly P', 'Taylor, Olga A', 'Bernhardt, Melanie Brooke', 'Kahalley, Lisa S', 'Pan, Wei', 'Lupo, Philip J', 'Hockenberry, Marilyn J', 'Scheurer, Michael E']","['Brown AL', 'Raghubar KP', 'Taylor OA', 'Bernhardt MB', 'Kahalley LS', 'Pan W', 'Lupo PJ', 'Hockenberry MJ', 'Scheurer ME']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5802-5073'],"[""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, One Baylor Plaza, MS: BCM622, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.

We have recently shown an association between an immune-infiltrated tumor microenvironment (TME) and resistance to cytarabine-based chemotherapy but responsiveness to flotetuzumab, a bispecific DART antibody-based molecule to CD3epsilon and CD123. This paper reports the results of a multicenter, open-label, phase 1/2 study of flotetuzumab in 88 adults with relapsed/refractory AML: 42 in a dose-finding segment and 46 at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 500 ng/kg per day. The most frequent adverse events were infusion-related reactions (IRRs)/cytokine release syndrome (CRS), largely grade 1-2. Stepwise dosing during week 1, pretreatment dexamethasone, prompt use of tocilizumab, and temporary dose reductions/interruptions successfully prevented severe IRR/CRS. Clinical benefit accrued to PIF/ER patients showing an immune-infiltrated TME. Among 30 PIF/ER patients treated at the RP2D, the complete remission (CR)/CR with partial hematological recovery (CRh) rate was 26.7%, with an overall response rate (CR/CRh/CR with incomplete hematological recovery) of 30.0%. In PIF/ER patients who achieved CR/CRh, median overall survival was 10.2 months (range, 1.87-27.27), with 6- and 12-month survival rates of 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.450-1.05) and 50% (95% CI, 0.154-0.846). Bone marrow transcriptomic analysis showed that a parsimonious 10-gene signature predicted CRs to flotetuzumab (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.904 vs 0.672 for the European LeukemiaNet classifier). Flotetuzumab represents an innovative experimental approach associated with acceptable safety and encouraging evidence of activity in PIF/ER patients. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02152956.","['Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Foster, Matthew C', 'Sayre, Peter H', 'Wieduwilt, Matthew J', 'Advani, Anjali S', 'Godwin, John E', 'Arellano, Martha L', 'Sweet, Kendra L', 'Emadi, Ashkan', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Erba, Harry P', 'Byrne, Michael', 'Michaelis, Laura', 'Topp, Max S', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Carrabba, Matteo Giovanni', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Huls, Gerwin A', 'Jongen-Lavrencic, Mojca', 'Wermke, Martin', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Gyan, Emmanuel', 'Recher, Christian', 'Stiff, Patrick J', 'Pettit, Kristen M', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Church, Sarah E', 'Anderson, Erica', 'Vadakekolathu, Jayakumar', 'Santaguida, Marianne', 'Rettig, Michael P', 'Muth, John', 'Curtis, Teia', 'Fehr, Erin', 'Guo, Kuo', 'Zhao, Jian', 'Bakkacha, Ouiam', 'Jacobs, Kenneth', 'Tran, Kathy', 'Kaminker, Patrick', 'Kostova, Maya', 'Bonvini, Ezio', 'Walter, Roland B', 'Davidson-Moncada, Jan K', 'Rutella, Sergio', 'DiPersio, John F']","['Uy GL', 'Aldoss I', 'Foster MC', 'Sayre PH', 'Wieduwilt MJ', 'Advani AS', 'Godwin JE', 'Arellano ML', 'Sweet KL', 'Emadi A', 'Ravandi F', 'Erba HP', 'Byrne M', 'Michaelis L', 'Topp MS', 'Vey N', 'Ciceri F', 'Carrabba MG', 'Paolini S', 'Huls GA', 'Jongen-Lavrencic M', 'Wermke M', 'Chevallier P', 'Gyan E', 'Recher C', 'Stiff PJ', 'Pettit KM', 'Lowenberg B', 'Church SE', 'Anderson E', 'Vadakekolathu J', 'Santaguida M', 'Rettig MP', 'Muth J', 'Curtis T', 'Fehr E', 'Guo K', 'Zhao J', 'Bakkacha O', 'Jacobs K', 'Tran K', 'Kaminker P', 'Kostova M', 'Bonvini E', 'Walter RB', 'Davidson-Moncada JK', 'Rutella S', 'DiPersio JF']",,"['Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope, Duarte, CA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Providence Cancer Institute, Portland, OR.', 'Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

It is generally considered that CBFbeta-SMMHC, the fusion protein encoded by CBFB-MYH11, is a dominant negative repressor of RUNX1. However, recent findings challenge the RUNX1-repression model for CBFbeta-SMMHC-mediated leukemogenesis. To definitively address the role of Runx1 in CBFB-MYH11-induced leukemia, we crossed conditional Runx1 knockout mice (Runx1f/f) with conditional Cbfb-MYH11 knockin mice (Cbfb+/56M). On Mx1-Cre activation in hematopoietic cells induced by poly (I:C) injection, all Mx1-CreCbfb+/56M mice developed leukemia in 5 months, whereas no leukemia developed in Runx1f/fMx1-CreCbfb+/56M mice, and this effect was cell autonomous. Importantly, the abnormal myeloid progenitors (AMPs), a leukemia-initiating cell population induced by Cbfb-MYH11 in the bone marrow, decreased and disappeared in Runx1f/fMx1-CreCbfb+/56M mice. RNA-seq analysis of AMP cells showed that genes associated with proliferation, differentiation blockage, and leukemia initiation were differentially expressed between Mx1-CreCbfb+/56M and Runx1f/fMx1-CreCbfb+/56M mice. In addition, with the chromatin immunocleavage sequencing assay, we observed a significant enrichment of RUNX1/CBFbeta-SMMHC target genes in Runx1f/fMx1-CreCbfb+/56M cells, especially among downregulated genes, suggesting that RUNX1 and CBFbeta-SMMHC mainly function together as activators of gene expression through direct target gene binding. These data indicate that Runx1 is indispensable for Cbfb-MYH11-induced leukemogenesis by working together with CBFbeta-SMMHC to regulate critical genes associated with the generation of a functional AMP population.","['Zhen, Tao', 'Cao, Yaqiang', 'Ren, Gang', 'Zhao, Ling', 'Hyde, R Katherine', 'Lopez, Guadalupe', 'Feng, Dechun', 'Alemu, Lemlem', 'Zhao, Keji', 'Liu, P Paul']","['Zhen T', 'Cao Y', 'Ren G', 'Zhao L', 'Hyde RK', 'Lopez G', 'Feng D', 'Alemu L', 'Zhao K', 'Liu PP']",,"['Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Epigenome Biology, Systems Biology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Epigenome Biology, Systems Biology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE; and.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Liver Diseases, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, and.', 'Laboratory of Epigenome Biology, Systems Biology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Oncogenesis and Development Section, National Human Genome Research Institute, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA-Seq', 'Single-Cell Analysis', '*Transcriptional Activation']",PMC7685208,,,2020/09/16 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/09/15 05:48'],"['2020/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/15 05:48 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)81994-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020007747 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Nov 19;136(21):2373-2385. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020007747.,,,,,,['Blood. 2020 Nov 19;136(21):2361-2362.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to investigate the lipid profiles of APL patients. PML-RARalpha transgenic mice and APL cells-transplanted mice were used to assess the effects of APL cells on the blood/liver lipid levels. Subsequently, gene set enrichment analysis, western blot and dual luciferase reporter assay were performed to examine the role and mechanism of PML-RARalpha and TRIB3 in lipid metabolism regulation in APL patients at pretreatment and after induction therapy. Results: APL patients exhibited a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia before anti-APL therapy based on a retrospective study. Furthermore, APL cells caused secretion of triglycerides, cholesterol, and PCSK9 from hepatocytes and degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptors in hepatocytes, which elevated the lipid levels in APL cell-transplanted mice and Pml-Raralpha transgenic mice. Mechanistically, pseudokinase TRIB3 interacted with PML-RARalpha to inhibit PPARgamma activity by interfering with the interaction of PPARgamma and RXR and promoting PPARgamma degradation. Thus, reduced PPARgamma activity in APL cells decreased leptin but increased resistin expression, causing lipid metabolism disorder in hepatocytes and subsequent dyslipidemia in mice. Although arsenic/ATRA therapy degraded PML-RARalpha and restored PPARgamma expression, it exacerbated dyslipidemia in APL patients. The elevated TRIB3 expression in response to arsenic/ATRA therapy suppressed PPARgamma activity by disrupting the PPARgamma/RXR dimer, which resulted in dyslipidemia in APL patients undergoing therapy. Indeed, the PPAR activator not only enhanced the anti-APL effects of arsenic/ATRA by suppressing TRIB3 expression but also reduced therapy-induced dyslipidemia in APL patients. Conclusion: Our work reveals the critical role of the PML-RARalpha/PPARgamma/TRIB3 axis in the development of dyslipidemia in APL patients, potentially conferring a rationale for combining ATRA/arsenic with the PPAR activator for APL treatment.","['Li, Ke', 'Wang, Feng', 'Yang, Zhao-Na', 'Cui, Bing', 'Li, Ping-Ping', 'Li, Zhen-Yu', 'Hu, Zhuo-Wei', 'Zhu, Hong-Hu']","['Li K', 'Wang F', 'Yang ZN', 'Cui B', 'Li PP', 'Li ZY', 'Hu ZW', 'Zhu HH']",,"['National Clinical Research Center for Metabolic Disease, Department of Metabolism and Endocrinology, the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410011, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Biotechnology of Antibiotics, Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100050, China.', 'Immunology and Cancer Pharmacology Group, State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100050, China.', 'Immunology and Cancer Pharmacology Group, State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100050, China.', 'Immunology and Cancer Pharmacology Group, State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100050, China.', 'Immunology and Cancer Pharmacology Group, State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, 100050, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, 230031 China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Metabolic Disease, Department of Metabolism and Endocrinology, the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410011, China.', 'Department of Hematology & Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang Province Key Laboratory of Hematology Oncology Diagnosis and Treatment, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310058, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200815,Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (PPARG protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (TRIB3 protein, human)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dyslipidemias/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'PPAR gamma/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptors/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",PMC7481410,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Cancer', '*leukemia', '*lipid metabolism', '*tribbles']",2020/09/16 06:00,2021/05/25 06:00,['2020/09/15 05:47'],"['2020/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/15 05:47 [entrez]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.45924 [doi]', 'thnov10p10326 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2020 Aug 15;10(22):10326-10340. doi: 10.7150/thno.45924. eCollection 2020.,['(c) The author(s).'],,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown mutations in the RAS/MAPK pathway in HDT and have demonstrated a clonal relationship between HDT and associated lymphoid malignancies through common translocations or identical immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. We performed whole exome sequencing on 16 cases of sHDT to further evaluate the spectrum of mutations that occur in sHDT in the context of an associated lymphoid malignancy, including cases associated with follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, B- and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, NOS. In addition, we assessed the clonal relationship between the HDT and the associated lymphoid malignancy in three cases for which matched samples were available. We found mutations in RAS/MAPK pathway genes in 14/16 cases of sHDT associated with diverse mature and precursor B-cell and T-cell neoplasms, involving KRAS (8/16), BRAF (2/16), NRAS (2/16), MAP2K1 (1/16), and NF1 (1/16). In addition, we note that FL-associated sHDT frequently shares a similar mutational profile to the associated malignancy, identifying mutations in CREBBP or KMT2D in all cases and ""aberrant"" somatic hypermutation in 5/6 cases. Our study confirms the role of the RAS/MAPK pathway in the pathogenesis of sHDT, provides further evidence of a common neoplastic precursor and, in the case of FL, gives additional insight into the stage in lymphomagenesis at which transdifferentiation may occur.","['Egan, Caoimhe', 'Lack, Justin', 'Skarshaug, Shannon', 'Pham, Thu Anh', 'Abdullaev, Zied', 'Xi, Liqiang', 'Pack, Svetlana', 'Pittaluga, Stefania', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Raffeld, Mark']","['Egan C', 'Lack J', 'Skarshaug S', 'Pham TA', 'Abdullaev Z', 'Xi L', 'Pack S', 'Pittaluga S', 'Jaffe ES', 'Raffeld M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5033-7072', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4632-0301']","['Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'NIAID Collaborative Bioinformatics Resource (NCBR), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. mraff@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20200914,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Histiocytic Sarcoma/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*genetics', 'ras Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,,,2020/09/16 06:00,2020/09/16 06:00,['2020/09/15 05:45'],"['2019/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/15 05:45 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41379-020-00673-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41379-020-00673-x [pii]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2021 Feb;34(2):336-347. doi: 10.1038/s41379-020-00673-x.

One of these concepts is the biological meaning of the small, spheroidal vesicles released from cells, which are described in the literature as microparticles, microvesicles, or exosomes. In the beginning, this research was difficult, as it was hard to distinguish these small vesicles from cell debris or apoptotic bodies. However, they may represent the first language of cell-cell communication, which existed before a more specific intercellular cross-talk between ligands and receptors emerged during evolution. In this review article, we will use the term ""extracellular microvesicles"" (ExMVs) to refer to these small spheroidal blebs of different sizes surrounded by a lipid layer of membrane. We have accepted an invitation from the Editor-in-Chief to write this review in observance of the 20th anniversary of the 2001 ASH Meeting when our team demonstrated that, by horizontal transfer of several bioactive molecules, including mRNA species and proteins, ExMVs harvested from embryonic stem cells could modify hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and expand them ex vivo. Interestingly, the result that moved ExMV research forward was published first in 2005 in Leukemia, having been previously rejected by other major scientific journals out of simple disbelief. Therefore, the best judge of a new concept is the passage of time, although the speed of its adoption is aided by perseverance and confidence in one's own data. In this perspective article, we will provide a brief update on the current status of, hopes for, and likely future of ExMV research as well as therapeutic and diagnostic applications, with a special emphasis on hematopoiesis.","['Ratajczak, Mariusz Z', 'Ratajczak, Janina']","['Ratajczak MZ', 'Ratajczak J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0071-0198'],"['Stem Cell Institute, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA. mzrata01@louisville.edu.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine, Center for Preclinical Research and Technology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland. mzrata01@louisville.edu.', 'Stem Cell Institute, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200914,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/genetics/*physiology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Exosomes/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",PMC7685969,,,2020/09/16 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/09/15 05:44'],"['2020/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/15 05:44 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-01041-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-01041-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Dec;34(12):3126-3135. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-01041-z.

We identified a non-physiologic CD19+/CD3+ T-cell population in the leukapheresis product of a patient undergoing CAR T-cell manufacturing who previously received a haploidentical HSCT, followed by infusion of a genetically engineered T-cell addback product. We confirm and report the origin of these CD19+/CD3+ T cells that have not previously been described in context of CAR T-cell manufacturing. We additionally interrogate the fate of these CD19-expressing cells as they undergo transduction to express CD19-specific CARs. MAIN BODY: We describe the case of a preteen male with multiply relapsed B-ALL who was treated with sequential cellular therapies. He received an alphabeta T-cell depleted haploidentical HSCT followed by addback of donor-derived T cells genetically modified with a suicide gene for iCaspase9 and truncated CD19 for cell tracking (RivoCel). He relapsed 6 months following HSCT and underwent leukapheresis and CAR T-cell manufacturing. During manufacturing, we identified an aberrant T-cell population dually expressing CD19 and CD3. We hypothesized that these cells were RivoCel cells and confirmed using flow cytometry and PCR that the identified cells were in fact RivoCel cells and were eliminated with iCaspase9 activation. We additionally tracked these cells through CD19-specific CAR transduction and notably did not detect T cells dually positive for CD19 and CD19-directed CARs. The most likely rationale for this is in vitro fratricide of the CD19+ 'artificial' T-cell population by the CD19-specific CAR+ T cells in culture. CONCLUSIONS: We report the identification of CD19+/CD3+ cells in an apheresis product undergoing CAR transduction derived from a patient previously treated with a haploidentical transplant followed by RivoCel addback. We aim to bring attention to this cell phenotype that may be recognized with greater frequency as CAR therapy and engineered alphabetahaplo-HSCT are increasingly coupled. We additionally suggest consideration towards using alternative markers to CD19 as a synthetic identifier for post-transplant addback products, as CD19-expression on effector T cells may complicate subsequent treatment using CD19-directed therapy.","['Schultz, Liora', 'Patel, Shabnum', 'Davis, Kara Lynn', 'Ramakrishna, Sneha', 'Sahaf, Bita', 'Bhatia, Neehar', 'Baggott, Christina', 'Erickson, Courtney', 'Majzner, Robbie G', 'Oak, Jean', 'Bertaina, Alice', 'Mackall, Crystal', 'Feldman, Steven']","['Schultz L', 'Patel S', 'Davis KL', 'Ramakrishna S', 'Sahaf B', 'Bhatia N', 'Baggott C', 'Erickson C', 'Majzner RG', 'Oak J', 'Bertaina A', 'Mackall C', 'Feldman S']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9512-7597'],"['Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA liora.schultz@gmail.com.', 'Stanford University, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford California, USA.', 'Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Stanford University, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford California, USA.', 'Stanford University, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford California, USA.', 'Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', ""Pediatrics, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Palo Alto, California, USA."", 'Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Stanford University, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford California, USA.', 'Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.', 'Stanford University, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis/*methods', 'Male', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",PMC7490929,['NOTNLM'],"['*adoptive', '*cell engineering', '*chimeric antigen', '*hematologic neoplasms', '*immunotherapy', '*pediatrics', '*receptors']",2020/09/16 06:00,2021/10/15 06:00,['2020/09/15 05:42'],"['2020/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/15 05:42 [entrez]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jitc-2020-001073 [pii]', '10.1136/jitc-2020-001073 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2020 Sep;8(2). pii: jitc-2020-001073. doi: 10.1136/jitc-2020-001073.,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

However, the role of K3 in leukemic stem cell (LSC) retention and growth in the remodeled tumor-promoting BM is unclear. We report that loss of K3 in a mouse model of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) triggers the release of LSCs from the BM into the circulation and impairs their retention, proliferation, and survival in secondary organs, which curbs CML development, progression, and metastatic dissemination. We found de novo expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) on CML-LSCs but not normal hematopoietic stem cells and this enabled us to specifically deplete K3 with a CTLA-4-binding RNA aptamer linked to a K3-siRNA (small interfering RNA) in CTLA-4(+) LSCs in vivo, which mobilized LSCs in the BM, induced disease remission, and prolonged survival of mice with CML. Thus, disrupting interactions of LSCs with the BM environment is a promising strategy to halt the disease-inducing and relapse potential of LSCs.","['Krenn, Peter William', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Fassler, Reinhard']","['Krenn PW', 'Koschmieder S', 'Fassler R']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8896-8387', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1011-8171']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, 82152 Martinsried, Germany; krenn@biochem.mpg.de.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, 82152 Martinsried, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200914,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (kindlin-3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*deficiency/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Stem Cell Niche', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC7533676,['NOTNLM'],"['*BM niche', '*Kindlin-3', '*integrin adhesion', '*leukemic stem cells', '*microenvironment']",2020/09/16 06:00,2020/12/19 06:00,['2020/09/15 05:42'],"['2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/15 05:42 [entrez]']","['2009078117 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.2009078117 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Sep 29;117(39):24326-24335. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2009078117.

However, the effector mechanisms appear to be specific to tumor type. Here we show that activation of ADRB2 by epinephrine, increased in response to immobilization stress, delays the loss of MCL1 apoptosis regulator (MCL1) protein expression induced by cytotoxic drugs in prostate cancer cells; and thus, increases resistance of prostate cancer xenografts to cytotoxic therapies. The effect of epinephrine on MCL1 protein depended on protein kinase A (PKA) activity, but was independent from androgen receptor expression. Furthermore, elevated blood epinephrine levels correlated positively with an increased MCL1 protein expression in human prostate biopsies. In summary, we demonstrate that stress triggers an androgen-independent antiapoptotic signaling via the ADRB2/PKA/MCL1 pathway in prostate cancer cells. IMPLICATIONS: Presented results justify clinical studies of ADRB2 blockers as therapeutics and of MCL1 protein expression as potential biomarker predicting efficacy of apoptosis-targeting drugs in prostate cancer.","['Hassan, Sazzad', 'Pullikuth, Ashok', 'Nelson, Kyle C', 'Flores, Anabel', 'Karpova, Yelena', 'Baiz, Daniele', 'Zhu, Sinan', 'Sui, Guangchao', 'Huang, Yue', 'Choi, Young A', ""D'Agostino, Ralph Jr"", 'Hemal, Ashok', 'von Holzen, Urs', 'Debinski, Waldemar', 'Kulik, George']","['Hassan S', 'Pullikuth A', 'Nelson KC', 'Flores A', 'Karpova Y', 'Baiz D', 'Zhu S', 'Sui G', 'Huang Y', 'Choi YA', ""D'Agostino R Jr"", 'Hemal A', 'von Holzen U', 'Debinski W', 'Kulik G']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0041-3310', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1764-4278', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4670-5623', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3746-6237']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine-South Bend, South Bend, Indiana.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Urology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine-South Bend, South Bend, Indiana.', 'Goshen Center for Cancer Care, Goshen, Indiana.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Brain Tumor Center of Excellence, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina. gkulik@wakehealth.edu.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Urology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Alfaisal University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200914,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (ADRB2 protein, human)', '0 (AR protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', 'YKH834O4BH (Epinephrine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Epinephrine/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'PC-3 Cells', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Androgen/metabolism', '*Up-Regulation']",PMC8080265,,,2020/09/16 06:00,2021/09/28 06:00,['2020/09/15 05:41'],"['2019/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/15 05:41 [entrez]']","['1541-7786.MCR-19-1037 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-19-1037 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2020 Dec;18(12):1839-1848. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-19-1037.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of flumatinib versus imatinib, for first-line treatment of chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, 394 patients were randomized 1:1 to flumatinib 600 mg once daily (n = 196) or imatinib 400 mg once daily (n = 198) groups. RESULTS: The rate of major molecular response (MMR) at 6 months (primary endpoint) was significantly higher with flumatinib than with imatinib (33.7% vs. 18.3%; P = 0.0006), as was the rate of MMR at 12 months (52.6% vs. 39.6%; P = 0.0102). At 3 months, the rate of early molecular response (EMR) was significantly higher in patients receiving flumatinib than in those receiving imatinib (82.1% vs. 53.3%; P < 0.0001). Compared with patients receiving imatinib, more patients receiving flumatinib achieved molecular remission 4 (MR4) at 6, 9, and 12 months (8.7% vs. 3.6%, P = 0.0358; 16.8% vs. 5.1%, P = 0.0002; and 23.0% vs. 11.7%, P = 0.0034, respectively). No patients had progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis in the flumatinib arm versus 4 patients in the imatinib arm by 12 months. Adverse events of edema, pain in extremities, rash, neutropenia, anemia, and hypophosphatemia were more frequent in imatinib arm, whereas diarrhea and alanine transaminase elevation were more frequent in flumatinib arm. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving flumatinib achieved significantly higher rates of responses, and faster and deeper responses compared with those receiving imatinib, indicating that flumatinib can be an effective first-line treatment for CML-CP.

Predominant in young adults, GCC potentially mitigates a high number of productive years of life lost. Indeed, long-term side effects have arisen as a problem in GCC survivors, especially in adolescent and young adult (AYA) subgroup. The objective of this study is to delineate survival and second primary malignancies (SPMs) in AYA patients with GCC. METHODS: We used US population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) 18 Regs Custom Data (1976-2016 varying) and SEER 9 Regs Research Data, November 2019 Sub (1975-2017) for survival analysis and SPM analysis, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, 5-, 10- and 20-year overall survival rates for AYA patients with GCC were 93%, 91.3%, and 86.9%, respectively. Compared with the general population, a significantly higher risk of SPMs was observed in multiple sites, especially stomach, (standardized incidence ratio [SIR]=2.94), pancreas (SIR=3.72), intrahepatic bile duct (SIR=3.12), soft tissue including heart (SIR=4.65), leukemia (SIR=3.70), and testis (SIR=562.18). The excess risks to develop leukemia were even higher in those with primary mediastinal GCC (SIR=69.50, P < 0.05, 95% confidence interval=30.00-136.94). Multivariate analysis indicated age of diagnosis, primary site, race, receipt of radiotherapy, and histological subtype independently correlated with risk of SPMs. CONCLUSION: The present study provides risk factors of SPM in AYA patients with GCC, which could facilitate the individualization of long-term surveillance in this population.","['Jiang, Shiyu', 'Jiang, Hongxin', 'Sun, Lijun', 'Luo, Zhiguo']","['Jiang S', 'Jiang H', 'Sun L', 'Luo Z']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, 270 Dongan Rd, Shanghai 200032, China..

The clinical course of ATLL is very heterogeneous, and many organs, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, can be involved. However, there are few detailed reports on ATLL infiltration in the GI tract. We investigated the clinical characteristics of ATLL infiltration in the GI tract. METHODS: This retrospective observational single-center study included 40 consecutive ATLL patients who underwent GI endoscopy. The patients' demographic and clinical characteristics and endoscopic findings were analyzed retrospectively. Patients with ATLL who were diagnosed by histological examination were divided into two groups based on GI tract infiltration. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed that the absence of skin lesions was significantly associated with GI infiltration (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the infiltration group tended to have similar macroscopic lesions in the upper and lower GI tracts, such as diffuse type, tumor-forming type, and giant-fold type. CONCLUSIONS: GI endoscopy may be considered for ATLL patients without skin lesions.","['Miike, Tadashi', 'Kawakami, Hiroshi', 'Kameda, Takuro', 'Yamamoto, Shojiro', 'Tahara, Yoshihiro', 'Hidaka, Tomonori', 'Kubuki, Yoko', 'Yorita, Kenji', 'Akiyama, Yutaka', 'Arimura, Yasuji', 'Kubota, Yoshimasa', 'Kataoka, Hiroaki', 'Shimoda, Kazuya']","['Miike T', 'Kawakami H', 'Kameda T', 'Yamamoto S', 'Tahara Y', 'Hidaka T', 'Kubuki Y', 'Yorita K', 'Akiyama Y', 'Arimura Y', 'Kubota Y', 'Kataoka H', 'Shimoda K']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2079-1693'],"['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Division of Endoscopy and Center for Digestive Disease, University of Miyazaki Hospital, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan. tadashi_miike@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan. tadashi_miike@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Division of Endoscopy and Center for Digestive Disease, University of Miyazaki Hospital, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Division of Endoscopy and Center for Digestive Disease, University of Miyazaki Hospital, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Division of Endoscopy and Center for Digestive Disease, University of Miyazaki Hospital, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kochi University Hospital, 185-1 Kohasu, Oko-cho, Nankoku, Kochi, 783-8505, Japan.', 'Section of Oncopathology and Regenerative Biology, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Support Center, University of Miyazaki Hospital, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Division of Endoscopy and Center for Digestive Disease, University of Miyazaki Hospital, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Section of Oncopathology and Regenerative Biology, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200914,England,BMC Gastroenterol,BMC gastroenterology,100968547,,IM,"['Adult', 'Gastrointestinal Tract', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', '*Lymphoma', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC7488713,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'GI tract infiltration', 'Irregular blood vessels', 'Obscure glandular structures', 'Skin lesion']",2020/09/16 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/15 05:33'],"['2020/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/15 05:33 [entrez]', '2020/09/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12876-020-01438-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12876-020-01438-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Gastroenterol. 2020 Sep 14;20(1):298. doi: 10.1186/s12876-020-01438-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) and regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha(Reg3a) might be important biomarkers to predict acute GVHD. Materials and methods: In the present study, blood samples were collected from 17 patients with acute GVHD and 12 control patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. ST2 and Reg3a were measured in plasma samples compared in patients with acute GVHD and the controls. Results: Median age of the study population was 42 years (range 19-49). When compared to controls, the mean ST2 levels was significant higher in acute GVHD (9794 ng/dL vs. 2646 ng/dL, P = 0.008). Mean Reg3a level did not show significant difference between control and acute GVHD group (8848 ng/dL vs. 5632 ng/dL, respectively, P = 0.190).

Since apoptosis resistance is the fundamental mechanism impeding TKIs' therapeutic effects, alternative approaches that induce nonapoptotic cell death are being pursued to treat TKI-resistant CML. Induction of necroptosis, a distinct, caspase-independent form of programmed cell death, may be a valuable strategy in this respect. The present study shows that shikonin, an herbal compound used in traditional Chinese medicine, overcomes TKI resistance in BCR/ABL-positive CML cells by inducing necroptosis via activation of RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL signaling. This effect occurs both in vitro and in vivo and involves downregulation of miR-92a-1-5p, a poor-prognosis marker frequently overexpressed in leukemia patients. Based on gene expression experiments, we conclude that miR-92a-1-5p promotes CML progression by inhibiting MLKL expression. Accordingly, we show that antagomiR-mediated in vivo inhibition of miR-92a-1-5p reduces the growth of CML tumors in mice through necroptosis induction. Our research suggests that therapies that relieve MLKL suppression by targeting miR-92a-1-5p may represent a useful strategy to treat TKI-refractory CML.","['Huang, Xianbo', 'Chen, Zhenzhen', 'Ni, Fan', 'Ye, Xiujin', 'Qian, Wenbin']","['Huang X', 'Chen Z', 'Ni F', 'Ye X', 'Qian W']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Hangzhou 310006, China."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Yiwu 322000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310009, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200914,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,,IM,,PMC7521527,['NOTNLM'],"['MLKL', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'miR-92a-1-5p', 'necroptosis', 'shikonin']",2020/09/15 06:00,2020/09/15 06:00,['2020/09/14 20:24'],"['2020/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/14 20:24 [entrez]']","['10.18632/aging.103844 [doi]', '103844 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Aging (Albany NY). 2020 Sep 14;12(17):17662-17680. doi: 10.18632/aging.103844.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Balb/c mice were divided into two groups of vaccinated and controls. The recombinant human LIF (rhLIF) protein and phosphate buffer saline was emulsified with Freund's adjuvant and injected into vaccinated and control groups, respectively. Theinhibition of implantation was evaluated in mice uterine. The concentration of secreted interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin (IL)-4 were measured in cultured splenocyte of mice stimulated by rhLIF. The expressions of immune responsive gene 1 (IRG-1), cochlin (COCH), amphiregulin(Ar), and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) genes were determined. Mice were assessed for inhibition of fertility after delivery, reversibility of immune response against rhLIF, and survival rate. Active immunization of mice with rhLIF resulted in reduction of the implantation and fertility rate up to 80.49% and 75%, respectively. All mice produced a high titer of anti-rhLIF antibodies in serums and vaginal fluids washes after 16 weeks; however, these antibodies were cleared from vaginal fluid washes after six months. A significant down-regulation in mRNA levels of IRG-1, Ar and HB-EGF was observed in vaccinated group compared to controls; however, no significant change in the expression profile of cochlin gene was detected. The results showed that rhLIF prevented pregnancy in a high percentage of female mice. Although the immunization of female Balb/c mice with rhLIF inhibited fertility and expression of genes associated with this molecule, further studies are needed to support this protein as a suitable candidate for contraceptive vaccine in mammals.","['Zare, Fateme', 'Amiri, Mohammad Mehdi', 'Hadinedoushan, Hossein', 'Dehghan-Manshadi, Mahdi', 'Mansouri, Fatemeh', 'Fesahat, Farzaneh', 'Saboor-Yaraghi, Ali Akbar']","['Zare F', 'Amiri MM', 'Hadinedoushan H', 'Dehghan-Manshadi M', 'Mansouri F', 'Fesahat F', 'Saboor-Yaraghi AA']",,"['Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Reproductive Immunology Research Center, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

CASE REPORT: We present a unique case of a four-year-old female who arrived via emergency medical services in cardiopulmonary arrest with clinical and radiographic evidence suggestive of bilateral pneumothoraces, prompting bilateral chest tube placement. Further evaluation revealed a large mediastinal mass and a concurrent white blood cell count of 428,400 per milliliter (/mL) (4,400-12,900/mL), with a 96% blast differential, consistent with complications of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSION: This case highlights how pulmonary capillary hypoperfusion secondary to leukostasis, coupled with a ventilation/perfusion mismatch due to compression atelectasis by an enlarged thymus, resulted in this patient's respiratory arrest. Furthermore, the case highlights how mediastinal masses in pediatric patients present potential diagnostic challenges for which ultrasound may prove beneficial.","['Wade, Christian I', 'Couperus-Mashewske, Cody J', 'Geurts, Mia E', 'Derfler, Nicholas', 'Ngo, John', 'Couperus, Kyle S']","['Wade CI', 'Couperus-Mashewske CJ', 'Geurts ME', 'Derfler N', 'Ngo J', 'Couperus KS']",,"['Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, School of Medicine, Department of Emergency Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'University of Maryland Medical Center, Department of Emergency Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Madigan Army Medical Center, Department of Emergency Medicine, Tacoma, Washington.', 'Madigan Army Medical Center, Department of Emergency Medicine, Tacoma, Washington.', 'Providence St. Peter Hospital Olympia, Department of Emergency Medicine, Olympia, Washington.', 'Madigan Army Medical Center, Department of Emergency Medicine, Tacoma, Washington.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Pract Cases Emerg Med,Clinical practice and cases in emergency medicine,101718968,,,,PMC7434292,,,2020/09/15 06:00,2020/09/15 06:01,['2020/09/14 17:05'],"['2020/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/14 17:05 [entrez]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:01 [medline]']","['cpcem.2020.5.47016 [pii]', '10.5811/cpcem.2020.5.47016 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Pract Cases Emerg Med. 2020 Aug;4(3):400-403. doi: 10.5811/cpcem.2020.5.47016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, the authors investigated coping and material measures of the financial hardship of these therapies among patients with Medicare Part D coverage. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective cohort study on a 20% sample of Medicare Part D enrollees who underwent treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide between July 2013 and June 2015. The authors described the variability in adherence rates and out-of-pocket payments among hospital referral regions in the first 6 months of therapy and determined whether adherence and out-of-pocket payments were associated with patient factors and the socioeconomic characteristics of where a patient was treated. RESULTS: There were 4153 patients who filled abiraterone or enzalutamide prescriptions through Medicare Part D in 228 hospital referral regions. The mean adherence rate was 75%. The median monthly out-of-pocket payment for abiraterone and enzalutamide was $706 (range, $0-$3505). After multilevel, multivariable adjustment for patient and regional factors, adherence was found to be lower in patients who were older (69% for patients aged >/=85 years vs 76% for patients aged <70 years; P < .01) and in those with low-income subsidies (69% in those with a subsidy vs 76% in those without a subsidy; P < .01). Both Hispanic ethnicity and living in a hospital referral region with a higher percentage of Hispanic beneficiaries were found to be independently associated with higher out-of-pocket payments for abiraterone and enzalutamide. CONCLUSIONS: There were substantial variations in the adherence rate and out-of-pocket payments among Medicare Part D beneficiaries who were prescribed abiraterone and enzalutamide. Sociodemographic patient and regional factors were found to be associated with both adherence and out-of-pocket payments.","['Caram, Megan E V', 'Oerline, Mary K', 'Dusetzina, Stacie', 'Herrel, Lindsey A', 'Modi, Parth K', 'Kaufman, Samuel R', 'Skolarus, Ted A', 'Hollenbeck, Brent K', 'Shahinian, Vahakn']","['Caram MEV', 'Oerline MK', 'Dusetzina S', 'Herrel LA', 'Modi PK', 'Kaufman SR', 'Skolarus TA', 'Hollenbeck BK', 'Shahinian V']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1597-5428', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3907-9196', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5754-4445', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5859-8151']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Ann Arbor VA Center for Clinical Management Research, VA Health Services Research and Development, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Urology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Health Policy, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Department of Urology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Urology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Urology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Ann Arbor VA Center for Clinical Management Research, VA Health Services Research and Development, VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Urology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Urology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Urology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200914,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Androstenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Nitriles)', '2010-15-3 (Phenylthiohydantoin)', '93T0T9GKNU (enzalutamide)', 'G819A456D0 (abiraterone)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Androstenes/administration & dosage/economics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/economics', 'Drug Costs', 'Health Expenditures/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Income', 'Insurance Coverage/economics', 'Male', 'Medicare Part D', 'Medication Adherence/*statistics & numerical data', 'Nitriles/administration & dosage/economics', 'Phenylthiohydantoin/administration & dosage/economics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States']",PMC7959094,['NOTNLM'],"['*hospital referral region (HRR)', '*medication adherence', '*out-of-pocket cost', '*prostate cancer', '*urologists']",2020/09/15 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/09/14 15:49'],"['2020/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/14 15:49 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33176 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Dec 1;126(23):5050-5059. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33176.

Relapse often results from the development of chemoresistance. One of the mechanisms of chemoresistance involves ALL cell interactions with the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, providing a sanctuary. This phenomenon is known as BM microenvironment-induced chemoprotection. Members of the transmembrane 4 superfamily (tetraspanins; TSPANs) are known to mediate microenvironmental interactions and have been extensively studied in solid tumors. Although the TSPAN family member CD81 is a minimal residual disease marker, its biological role in ALL is not well characterized. We show for the first time that CD81 knockout induces chemosensitivity, reduces cellular adhesion, and disrupts in vivo BM homing and engraftment in B-ALL. This chemosensitization is mediated through control of Bruton tyrosine kinase signaling and induction of p53-mediated cell death. We then show how CD81-related signaling can be disrupted by treatment with the epigenetic drug combination of DNA hypomethylating agent azacitidine (aza) and histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (pano), which we previously used to sensitize ALL cells to chemotherapy under conditions that promote BM microenvironment-induced chemoprotection. Aza/pano-mediated modulation of CD81 surface expression is involved in decreasing BM load by promoting ALL cell mobilization from BM to peripheral blood and increasing response to chemotherapy in disseminated patient-derived xenograft models. This study identifies the novel role of CD81 in BM microenvironment-induced chemoprotection and delineates the mechanism by which aza/pano successfully sensitizes ALL cells via modulation of CD81.","['Quagliano, Anthony', 'Gopalakrishnapillai, Anilkumar', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Barwe, Sonali P']","['Quagliano A', 'Gopalakrishnapillai A', 'Kolb EA', 'Barwe SP']",,"['Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Cancer and Blood Disorders, Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE; and.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE.', 'Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Cancer and Blood Disorders, Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE; and.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE.', 'Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Cancer and Blood Disorders, Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE; and.', 'Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Cancer and Blood Disorders, Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, DE; and.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Delaware, Newark, DE.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (CD81 protein, human)', '0 (Tetraspanin 28)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine', 'Bone Marrow', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetraspanin 28/genetics', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC7509883,,,2020/09/15 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/14 15:46'],"['2020/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/14 15:46 [entrez]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31521-4 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001592 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Sep 22;4(18):4393-4405. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001592.,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['P20 GM103446/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103464/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 GM104941/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we quantify SERINC3 and SERINC5 internalization function for 339 Nef clones, representing the major pandemic HIV-1 group M subtypes A, B, C and D. We describe distinct subtype-associated hierarchies for Nef-mediated internalization of SERINC5, for which subtype B clones display the highest activities on average, and of SERINC3, for which subtype B clones display the lowest activities on average. We further identify Nef polymorphisms that modulate its ability to counteract SERINC proteins, including substitutions in the N-terminal domain that selectively impair SERINC3 internalization. Our findings demonstrate that the SERINC antagonism activities of HIV Nef differ markedly among major viral subtypes and between individual isolates within a subtype, suggesting that variation in these functions may contribute to global differences in viral pathogenesis.","['Jin, Steven W', 'Mwimanzi, Francis M', 'Mann, Jaclyn K', 'Bwana, Mwebesa Bosco', 'Lee, Guinevere Q', 'Brumme, Chanson J', 'Hunt, Peter W', 'Martin, Jeff N', 'Bangsberg, David R', ""Ndung'u, Thumbi"", 'Brumme, Zabrina L', 'Brockman, Mark A']","['Jin SW', 'Mwimanzi FM', 'Mann JK', 'Bwana MB', 'Lee GQ', 'Brumme CJ', 'Hunt PW', 'Martin JN', 'Bangsberg DR', ""Ndung'u T"", 'Brumme ZL', 'Brockman MA']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4091-9954', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4854-4501', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2398-1273', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2722-5288', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8157-1037', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6432-1426']","['Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada.', 'HIV Pathogenesis Programme, The Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Mbarara University of Science and Technology, Mbarara, Uganda.', 'British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, Canada.', 'British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, United States of America.', 'School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, United States of America.', 'School of Public Health, Oregon Health Science University, Portland, United States of America.', 'HIV Pathogenesis Programme, The Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.', 'Africa Health Research Institute, Durban, South Africa.', 'Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard University, Cambridge, United States of America.', 'Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin, Germany.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada.', 'British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada.', 'British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200914,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (SERINC3 protein, human)', '0 (SERINC5 protein, human)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['HIV Infections/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Membrane Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Virus Replication', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC7515180,,,2020/09/15 06:00,2020/10/22 06:00,['2020/09/14 15:46'],"['2020/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/14 15:46 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1008813 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-20-00101 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2020 Sep 14;16(9):e1008813. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008813. eCollection 2020 Sep.,,"['UM1 AI126617/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI027763/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'PJT-162123/CIHR/Canada', 'PJT-148621 /CIHR/Canada', 'THA-118569/CIHR/Canada']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is associated with a high risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), especially in patients with high MTX concentrations. Although therapeutic drug monitoring is performed to monitor MTX concentrations, it is unclear what concentration should be considered critical, thus requiring rescue protocols to prevent nephrotoxicity. METHODS: Patients treated with high-dose methotrexate for lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia and those benefited from therapeutic drug monitoring were included. The relationship between MTX concentrations and the presence or absence of AKI was assessed. MTX concentrations were analyzed using a population pharmacokinetic approach. Specific attention was given to morphological covariates because MTX doses are individualized according to body surface area (BSA). RESULTS: In total, 328 patients and 657 cycles of treatment were analyzed. Higher MTX concentrations were observed in the AKI+ group. For cycle 1, all patients showing an MTX concentration >6 microM at 36 hours or >2 microM at 48 hours after infusion developed nephrotoxicity. The final pharmacokinetic model had 2 compartments and included the effect of age on clearance (CL) and of body weight on peripheral distribution volume. None of the morphological covariates tested on CL led to significant improvement in the model. Higher MTX concentrations were observed in patients with extreme BSA values (>/=2 m2) or body mass index (>/=25 kg/m2). Patients with AKI who received at least 1 cycle had higher BSA and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study provide additional information on the relationship between MTX concentration and nephrotoxicity. Patients with a plasma MTX concentration >6 microM at 36 hours were more likely to manifest AKI. In addition, the results suggest that overweight patients have a high AKI risk and that BSA-based adjustment of MTX dose is not appropriate.","['Gallais, Fanny', 'Oberic, Lucie', 'Faguer, Stanislas', 'Tavitian, Suzanne', 'Lafont, Thierry', 'Marsili, Sabrina', 'Brice, Aurelie', 'Chatelut, Etienne', 'Puisset, Florent']","['Gallais F', 'Oberic L', 'Faguer S', 'Tavitian S', 'Lafont T', 'Marsili S', 'Brice A', 'Chatelut E', 'Puisset F']",,"['Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM UMR-1037, CNRS ERL5294, Universite Paul Sabatier.', ""Departement d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole."", ""Departement de Nephrologie et Transplantation d'organes, Centre de reference des maladies renales rares, Hopital Rangueil, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse."", ""Departement d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole."", 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM UMR-1037, CNRS ERL5294, Universite Paul Sabatier.', 'Laboratoire de pharmacologie, Institut Claudius-Regaud, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole; and.', 'Laboratoire de pharmacologie, Institut Claudius-Regaud, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole; and.', 'Laboratoire de pharmacologie, Institut Claudius-Regaud, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole; and.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM UMR-1037, CNRS ERL5294, Universite Paul Sabatier.', 'Laboratoire de pharmacologie, Institut Claudius-Regaud, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole; and.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse, INSERM UMR-1037, CNRS ERL5294, Universite Paul Sabatier.', 'Laboratoire de pharmacologie, Institut Claudius-Regaud, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole; and.', 'Departement Pharmacie, Institut Claudius-Regaud, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/chemically induced', 'Adult', '*Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Body Surface Area', 'Humans', '*Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Overweight', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",,,,2020/09/15 06:00,2021/11/16 06:00,['2020/09/14 15:44'],"['2020/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/14 15:44 [entrez]']","['00007691-202106000-00015 [pii]', '10.1097/FTD.0000000000000813 [doi]']",ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2021 Jun 1;43(3):408-415. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000813.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Over 75% of our patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma experienced a 6-MP-related toxicity.

RECENT FINDINGS: Approximately 30 years after they were first conceived of and 15 years after the first small-scale single-center clinical trials, the past 3 years represent a major milestone in the development of CAR T cells. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Tisagenlecleucel for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-ALL and Axicabtagene Ciloleucel, for adults with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL) in 2017. Tisagenlecleucel received a second indication in adults with R/R DLBCL in 2018. Regulatory approval for CAR T cells was then granted in Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan. Most recently, in July 2020 the FDA granted regulatory approval to a third CAR T cell product, Brexucabtagene Autoleucel for mantle cell lymphoma.

Given the established link between perforin deficiency and primary HLH, we investigated the role of perforin in anti-CD19 CAR T cell efficacy and HLH-like toxicities in a syngeneic murine model. Perforin contributed to both CD8+ and CD4+ CAR T cell cytotoxicity but was not required for in vitro or in vivo leukemia clearance. Upon CAR-mediated in vitro activation, perforin-deficient CAR T cells produced higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines compared with WT CAR T cells. Following in vivo clearance of leukemia, perforin-deficient CAR T cells reexpanded, resulting in splenomegaly with disruption of normal splenic architecture and the presence of hemophagocytes, which are findings reminiscent of HLH. Notably, a substantial fraction of patients who received anti-CD22 CAR T cells also experienced biphasic inflammation, with the second phase occurring after the resolution of cytokine release syndrome, resembling clinical manifestations of HLH. Elevated inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta and IL-18 and concurrent late CAR T cell expansion characterized the HLH-like syndromes occurring in the murine model and in humans. Thus, a murine model of perforin-deficient CAR T cells recapitulated late-onset inflammatory toxicities occurring in human CAR T cell recipients, providing therapeutically relevant mechanistic insights.","['Ishii, Kazusa', 'Pouzolles, Marie', 'Chien, Christopher D', 'Erwin-Cohen, Rebecca A', 'Kohler, M Eric', 'Qin, Haiying', 'Lei, Haiyan', 'Kuhn, Skyler', 'Ombrello, Amanda K',

For the time being, after a long debate, the prognosis-dependent type of consolidation and maintenance became - sometimes until relapse - the standard approach in myeloma patients. The so-called small molecules, which turned out to be effective as induction and relapse agents, are continuously moving toward maintenance settings. Moreover, maintenance efforts seem to be more and more considered and used in transplanted or some non-transplanted acute myeloid leukaemia patients as well.

Unmet need was considered as supportive care needs not met. Methods: The most vulnerable cALL survivors from the PETALE study cohort completed the Short-Form Survivor Unmet Needs Survey, the Brief Pain Inventory and the 15D instrument of health-related quality of life. Demographic and clinical information, including comorbidities, were obtained from medical records or self-reporting. The participants' needs and contributing factors to their needs were evaluated using nonparametric tests. Results: Of the 72 participants, 9 (13%) reported moderate/high levels of overall unmet needs. ""Worry about earning money"" (56%) and ""Dealing with feeling tired"" (51%) were the most frequent unmet needs (all levels combined). The factors associated significantly with any domain of unmet needs were: having a comorbidity, reporting altered functional health status, high ALL risk status, pain, age (<26 years), and having previously received psychological support. Conclusion: A minority of young adult survivors of cALL with comorbidities interviewed reported moderate/high levels of unmet needs. However, financial concerns and emotional health and relationship are the two domains of greatest need. Survivors with altered health condition are most at risk of experiencing moderate/high levels of unmet needs. If confirmed in larger samples, interventions should target modifiable contributors of unmet needs such as physical health and comfort, fatigue, and emotional health.","['Lamore, Kristopher', 'Bourdeau, Camille', 'Alos, Nathalie', 'Bertout, Laurence', 'Curnier, Daniel', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Lippe, Sarah', 'Marcil, Valerie', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Rondeau, Emelie', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Sultan, Serge']","['Lamore K', 'Bourdeau C', 'Alos N', 'Bertout L', 'Curnier D', 'Drouin S', 'Krajinovic M', 'Laverdiere C', 'Lippe S', 'Marcil V', 'Robaey P', 'Rondeau E', 'Sinnett D', 'Sultan S']",,"['Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Universite de Paris, LPPS, Boulogne-Billancourt, France.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Kinesiology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Nutrition, and Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Canada."", 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine UHC Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200914,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,IM,"['Adult', 'Comorbidity', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*late adverse effects', '*morbidities', '*supportive care needs', '*survivorship', '*unmet needs']",2020/09/15 06:00,2021/11/27 06:00,['2020/09/14 15:39'],"['2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/14 15:39 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2020.0090 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2021 Aug;10(4):462-475. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2020.0090.

METHODS: A total of 725 patients with ALL were enrolled. The 11q23/MLL gene rearrangement and its partner genes were detected. The clinical and laboratory features and prognosis of patients with MLL gene rearrangement were analyzed. RESULTS: MLL gene rearrangement was detected in 42 cases (5.8%) of the patients, with the dominant immunophenotype being pro-B-ALL. Among the partner genes, the MLL/AF4 was the most common. Compared with the non-MLL/AF4 group, the MLL/AF4 group had higher white blood cell and immature cell counts. No significant difference was found in complete remission and 1-year overall survival (OS) rates between the two groups (P> 0.05). Compared with the non-MLL/AF4 group, the MLL/AF4 group had a higher recurrence rate (P<0.05) and a lower 3-year OS rate (P<0.05). Compared with the untransplantation group, the transplantation group had higher 2-year OS and progress free survival rates (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis suggested age </=1 year, MLL/AF4 positive, early recurrence, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (Allo-HSCT) to be independent factors which can influence the survival of ALL patients with 11q23/MLL rearrangement (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: MLL/AF4 is the most common partner gene for 11q23/MLL gene rearrangement. This type of leukemia is mainly pro-B-ALL. Although conventional chemotherapy can achieve certain rate of remission, it is easy to relapse and the prognosis is very poor. Allo-HSCT may improve the prognosis.","['Wang, Yuanyuan']",['Wang Y'],,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Tumor Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan 450008, China. wyy813222@163.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)'],IM,"['*Gene Rearrangement', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,2020/09/15 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/09/14 05:58'],"['2020/09/14 05:58 [entrez]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['940637226 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20190116-00015 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Oct 10;37(10):1092-1096. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.cn511374-20190116-00015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, emergence of resistance and toxicity are major limitations which lead to treatment discontinuation. There remains, therefore, a clear need for new therapeutic options. In this review, we discuss recent progress in the development of BTK-targeted proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) describing how such agents may provide advantages over ibrutinib and highlighting features of PROTACs that are important for the development of effective BTK degrading agents. Overall, PROTACs appear to be an exciting new approach to target BTK.

However, the use of pan-Notch inhibitors to treat cancers has been hampered by adverse effects, particularly intestinal toxicities. To circumvent this barrier in T-ALL, we aimed to inhibit ETS1, a developmentally important T-cell transcription factor previously shown to co-bind Notch response elements. Using complementary genetic approaches in mouse models, we show that ablation of Ets1 leads to strong Notch-mediated suppressive effects on T-cell development and leukemogenesis, but milder intestinal effects than pan-Notch inhibitors. Mechanistically, genome-wide chromatin profiling studies demonstrate that Ets1 inactivation impairs recruitment of multiple Notch-associated factors and Notch-dependent activation of transcriptional elements controlling major Notch-driven oncogenic effector pathways. These results uncover previously unrecognized hierarchical heterogeneity of Notch-controlled genes and points to Ets1-mediated enucleation of Notch-Rbpj transcriptional complexes as a target for developing specific anti-Notch therapies in T-ALL that circumvent the barriers of pan-Notch inhibition.","['McCarter, Anna C', 'Della Gatta, Giusy', 'Melnick, Ashley', 'Kim, Erin', 'Sha, Cher', 'Wang, Qing', 'Nalamolu, Jahnavi K', 'Liu, Yiran', 'Keeley, Theresa M', 'Yan, Ran', 'Sun, Mengxi', 'Kodgule, Rohan', 'Kunnath, Nicholas', 'Ambesi-Impiombato, Alberto', 'Kuick, Rork', 'Rao, Arvind', 'Ryan, Russell J H', 'Kee, Barbara L', 'Samuelson, Linda C', 'Ostrowski, Michael C', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A', 'Chiang, Mark Y']","['McCarter AC', 'Della Gatta G', 'Melnick A', 'Kim E', 'Sha C', 'Wang Q', 'Nalamolu JK', 'Liu Y', 'Keeley TM', 'Yan R', 'Sun M', 'Kodgule R', 'Kunnath N', 'Ambesi-Impiombato A', 'Kuick R', 'Rao A', 'Ryan RJH', 'Kee BL', 'Samuelson LC', 'Ostrowski MC', 'Ferrando AA', 'Chiang MY']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3828-9797', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2450-9739', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1711-8641', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3821-7144', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8817-5192', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8174-3962']","['Cell and Molecular Biology Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Stanford University, Stanford, California.', 'Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, New York. af2196@columbia.edu markchia@med.umich.edu.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. af2196@columbia.edu markchia@med.umich.edu.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Cancer Discov,Blood cancer discovery,101764786,,,,PMC7482717,['NOTNLM'],"['ETS1', 'NOTCH1', 'T-ALL', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'T-cell development', 'enhancer', 'gamma-secretase inhibitors']",2020/09/15 06:00,2020/09/15 06:01,['2020/09/14 05:57'],"['2020/09/14 05:57 [entrez]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-20-0026 [doi]', '2643-3230.BCD-20-0026 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cancer Discov. 2020 Sep;1(2):178-197. doi: 10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-20-0026.,,"['R35 CA210065/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI136941/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 CA228228/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK034933/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA208013/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA013696/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK118023/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007315/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI106352/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA196604/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Conflict of interest disclosure: A.A.F.: Consulting for Ayala Pharmaceuticals and', 'SpringWorks Therapeutics.

The therapeutic potential of MSCs can be increased by genetic modification to overexpress cytokines and growth factors. Here we produced mouse MSCs overexpressing human leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to assess their proangiogenic potential in vitro and in vivo. Mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs were transduced by using a second-generation lentiviral system to express human LIF. Leukemia inhibitory factor expression was confirmed by RT-qPCR and by ELISA, allowing the quantification of the transcript and secreted protein, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis and trilineage differentiation assay showed that the MSC_LIF cell line maintained the immunophenotype and a multipotency characteristic of MSCs. The immunosuppressive activity of MSC_LIF was confirmed using a lymphoproliferation assay. Moreover, gene expression analysis demonstrated upregulation of genes coding for strategic factors in the neovascularization process, such as angiogenin, IL-8, MCP-1, and VEGF, and for the perivascular cell markers alphaSMA, Col4a1, SM22, and NG2. To evaluate the pro-angiogenic potential of MSC_LIF, we first tested its effects on endothelial cells obtained from umbilical vein in a scratch wound healing assay. Conditioned medium (CM) from MSC_LIF promoted a significant increase in cell migration compared to CM from control MSC. Additionally, in vitro tube formation of endothelial cells was increased by the presence of MSC_LIF, as shown in microvessel sprouting in aortic ring cultures. Finally, an in vivo Matrigel plug assay was performed, showing that MSC_LIF were more potent in promoting in vivo angiogenesis and tissue vascularization than control MSCs. In conclusion, LIF overexpression is a promising strategy to increase the proangiogenic potential of MSCs and sets precedents for future investigations of their potential applications for the treatment of ischemic diseases and tissue repair.","['Santos, Girlaine Cafe', 'Silva, Daniela Nascimento', 'Fortuna, Vitor', 'Silveira, Brysa Mariana', 'Orge, Iasmim Diniz', 'de Santana, Thais Alves', 'Sampaio, Gabriela Louise', 'Paredes, Bruno Diaz', 'Ribeiro-Dos-Santos, Ricardo', 'Soares, Milena Botelho Pereira']","['Santos GC', 'Silva DN', 'Fortuna V', 'Silveira BM', 'Orge ID', 'de Santana TA', 'Sampaio GL', 'Paredes BD', 'Ribeiro-Dos-Santos R', 'Soares MBP']",,"['Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Health Institute of Technology, SENAI-CIMATEC, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Health Institute of Technology, SENAI-CIMATEC, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Health Sciences Institute, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Health Sciences Institute, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Health Institute of Technology, SENAI-CIMATEC, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Health Institute of Technology, SENAI-CIMATEC, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Salvador, Brazil.', ""Research D'Or Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."", 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Health Institute of Technology, SENAI-CIMATEC, Salvador, Brazil.', 'National Institute of Science and Technology for Regenerative Medicine, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Health Institute of Technology, SENAI-CIMATEC, Salvador, Brazil.', 'National Institute of Science and Technology for Regenerative Medicine, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200814,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC7456813,['NOTNLM'],"['LIF', 'angiogenesis', 'genetic modification', 'mesenchymal stem/stromal cells', 'proangiogenico factors']",2020/09/15 06:00,2020/09/15 06:01,['2020/09/14 05:54'],"['2020/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/14 05:54 [entrez]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2020.00778 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2020 Aug 14;8:778. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2020.00778. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Santos, Silva, Fortuna, Silveira, Orge, de Santana, Sampaio,', 'Paredes, Ribeiro-dos-Santos and Soares.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with hematologic malignancies appear to have a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease due to myelosuppression and lymphopenia. The first challenge, therefore, is how to continue to deliver effective, curative therapy to vulnerable patients and at the same time avoid exposing them, and their health care teams (HCT), to SARS-CoV-2. An additional challenge is the timely completion of the diagnostic and staging studies required to formulate appropriate treatment plans. Deferred procedures and avoidance of multiple trips to the surgical, diagnostic, and laboratory suites require same day consolidation of all procedures. With laboratory medicine absorbed by the need to deploy large scale COVID-testing, the availability of routine molecular tests is affected. Finally, we are increasingly faced with the challenge of making complex treatment decisions in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with aggressive but potentially curable blood cancers. When to treat, how to treat, when to wait, how long to wait, how to predict and manage toxicities, and how to avoid compromising cure rates remains unknown. We present an outline of the scientific, medical, and operational challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic at selected American and European institutions and offer our current view of the key elements of a response.

With several approved new drugs targeting specific mutations with better outcomes, we describe here two cases of AML in which, NPM1 was detected at diagnosis. The impact of age, type of treatment, stability of NPM1 mutation, and co-occurring mutations on survival are the essential parameters for investigation. METHOD: Both the cases of AML were females, >60 years of age with normal 46XX karyotype. Allele specific RT-PCR and fragment analysis was performed for the detection of NPM1-A mutation at diagnosis. Both the patients were unfit for intensive chemotherapy therefore reduced intensity induction chemotherapy regimen was initially administered. Next-generation sequencing was performed for comprehensive mutational profiling, which guided targeted treatment, prognostic stratification, and response assessment. RESULT: We report that the older AML patients with NPM1 mutation may not have a good outcome with intensive chemotherapy, especially patients with concurrent DNMT3A/IDH-1/2 mutations. In the second case with mutated NPM1, concurrent FLT3-ITD mutation served as a therapeutic target. The FLT3 inhibitor used in combination with standard therapy showed promising results in this case. CONCLUSION: Here, we emphasize on the utility of next generation sequencing in guiding the treatment initiation or modulation during the disease course and risk stratification in AML. In conclusion, conventional chemotherapy in AML gives very poor overall survival rates and targeted chemotherapy against specific mutations may drastically improve patient survival and treatment outcomes.","['Jain, Garima', 'Thakral, Deepshi', 'Sahoo, Ranjit Kumar', 'Kumar, Indresh', 'Vashishtha, Sangeeta', 'Verma, Pramod', 'Gupta, Ritu']","['Jain G', 'Thakral D', 'Sahoo RK', 'Kumar I', 'Vashishtha S', 'Verma P', 'Gupta R']",,"['Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr BR Ambedkar Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr BR Ambedkar Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dr BR Ambedkar Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr BR Ambedkar Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr BR Ambedkar Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr BR Ambedkar Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.', 'Laboratory Oncology Unit, Dr BR Ambedkar Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200825,United States,Am J Blood Res,American journal of blood research,101569577,,,,PMC7486490,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'DNMT3A', 'FLT3-ITD', 'IDH1/2', 'NPM1', 'allelic ratio', 'next-generation sequencing']",2020/09/15 06:00,2020/09/15 06:01,['2020/09/14 05:53'],"['2020/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/14 05:53 [entrez]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Blood Res. 2020 Aug 25;10(4):134-144. eCollection 2020.,['AJBR Copyright (c) 2020.'],,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In current exploratory era of immunotherapy, the detailed enumeration data of Tregs cells in pediatric AML is lacking. AIM: Serial assessment of Treg absolute values in pediatric AML at diagnosis and follow-up; and correlating with outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. METHODS: Study objectives were determining Tregs (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+) were assessed at diagnosis, post-induction, post-consolidation, 3 and 6 months follow-up and relapse in 30 consecutive pediatric AML patients. RESULTS: Patients with AML had higher baseline Treg frequencies than controls (P=0.0001). Female patients, WBC > 50,000 x 10(3)/L and hypoalbuminemia were significantly associated with high Treg absolute values. Baseline Tregs were not associated with DFS, EFS and OS. Tregs significantly decreased after induction chemotherapy (P=0.028). Using generalized-estimating-equation regression model, Treg absolute numbers continued to decrease at each assessment time point from post-induction till 6 months follow-up (P=0.029) in those who are in continuous CR; however, in those patients who relapsed, Tregs did not change from post-induction till last follow-up preceding relapse (P=0.39). CONCLUSIONS: This first study in pediatric AML demonstrates that Tregs are increased at diagnosis; the increased number is significantly associated with female gender and high WBC count. Tregs decrease after induction chemotherapy as compared to their baseline value. Post CR, Treg absolute values continue to decrease significantly in those who stay in CR but not so in those who relapse; this suggests their possible role in leukemogenesis.","['Bansal, Anuj Kumar', 'Sharawat, Surender Kumar', 'Gupta, Ritu', 'Vishnubhatla, Sreenivas', 'Dhawan, Deepa', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Bansal AK', 'Sharawat SK', 'Gupta R', 'Vishnubhatla S', 'Dhawan D', 'Bakhshi S']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology New Delhi-110029, India.', 'Department of Dr. B.R.A.

Early mortality rate of 30% has been reported in developed countries despite prompt initiation of treatment. We have previously reported an early induction mortality of approximately 62% in our cohort. Based on this mortality rate, we made changes in our treatment protocol. The objective of this follow-up study was to report the early induction mortality and overall survival of patients with APL after incorporating changes in chemotherapy and supportive care regimen. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective descriptive study conducted at Aga Khan University Karachi, Pakistan from October 2012 till October 2019. Data of patients included clinical features, morphological findings, cytogenetic and PCR studies, cytotoxic protocols, overall outcome and causes of early induction mortality. The changes in treatment protocol included prophylactic infusion of fresh frozen plasma, dexamethasone therapy and other changes in supportive care regimen. Results were recorded as frequencies and percentages. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze patient's data. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: During the study period, total of 447 patients presented with acute myeloid leukemia at our institution out of which 40 patients were diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (9%). Out of these 40 patients 24 were males and 16 were females. The median age was 37 years. Twenty-five patients were in low risk group whereas 15 were high-risk. Differentiation syndrome was seen in 14 patients. As a part of induction chemotherapy, 13 patients received only ATRA because they were not eligible for chemotherapy and 17 patients received a combination of ATRA and anthracycline. Among the remaining patients, four received ATRA, arsenic and anthracycline while two received ATRA and arsenic only. Four patients did not receive any treatment because of rapid deterioration of clinical condition and death. The overall survival was 65% and early induction mortality was 30%. CONCLUSION: The early induction mortality decreased to 30% from 62% in this study and the overall survival was 65%. With the introduction of prophylactic infusion of fresh frozen plasma, dexamethasone and appropriate supportive treatment during the induction chemotherapy, we were able to improve the induction mortality and overall survival of patients.","['Shaikh, Mohammad Usman', 'Ali, Natasha', 'Karim, Farheen', 'Raheem, Ahmed', 'Sarwar, Shahzad']","['Shaikh MU', 'Ali N', 'Karim F', 'Raheem A', 'Sarwar S']",,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine/Oncology, Aga Khan University Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine/Oncology, Aga Khan University Karachi, Pakistan.', 'New Cross Hospital, Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust UK.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Chughtai Laboratory Lahore Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200825,United States,Am J Blood Res,American journal of blood research,101569577,,,,PMC7486488,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'Early induction', 'deaths', 'improved outcome']",2020/09/15 06:00,2020/09/15 06:01,['2020/09/14 05:53'],"['2020/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/14 05:53 [entrez]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Blood Res. 2020 Aug 25;10(4):82-89. eCollection 2020.,['AJBR Copyright (c) 2020.'],,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, management of AML in the pregnant patient has been challenging as most interventions are contraindicated in pregnancy. Medical termination of pregnancy is advocated over chemotherapy in the first trimester as delaying chemotherapy could often be fatal. Chemotherapy during second and third trimesters may be provided with close surveillance of fetal abnormalities. The outcomes in these patients have not been systematically studied and have been limited to case reports and case series in medical literature. METHODS: Patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of AML were identified using the International Classification of Disease (ICD-9) codes in the National Inpatient Sample database. This database is maintained by the Agency of Healthcare Research Quality under the United States Department of Health and Human Services. It represents 20% of all hospitalizations occurring in the United States every year. Amongst these AML patients, all patients who were pregnant were identified and their demographic information was extracted. Other details related to their hospitalization, hospital size, location, region and teaching status were also determined. The association of outcomes with common medical comorbidities was studied. Pregnancy related outcomes, mode of delivery and mortality rates were calculated for the 15 year time period. RESULTS: During the time period of 2000 to 2014, 678942 hospitalizations involved AML patients of which 5076 were noted to be from pregnant women. The hospitalization trend gradually increased over these years and was noted to be the highest in the age group of 18-34 years. The highest hospitalization rates were noted in African American and Native American patient populations. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease and smoking were noted to be more prevalent in pregnant women with AML. A majority of these patients had a Charlson's comorbidity index of 1-3. 3.5% of patients underwent medical termination of pregnancy, 16.25% suffered from pregnancy related complications, 0.6% suffered from puerperal infection, 4% of patients had normal vaginal delivery, 2.8% of patients had caesarian section and 5.7% of patient died. The rate of mortality was the highest in Native Americans followed by Caucasians. Multiple regression showed that odds of mortality have decreased from 2000 to 2015 and that a higher Charlson's comorbidity score was an independent predictor of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first nationwide study to document the outcomes of pregnancy in hospitalized AML patients. AML in pregnancy is rare and this study shows that the mortality has been improving over the past 15 years. Notably, vaginal delivery has been more common than caesarian section in pregnant AML patients. Native Americans have high prevalence and high mortality rates, a likely result of healthcare disparity. Pregnant AML patients with high Charlson's comorbidity score may benefit from aggressive management of their comorbidities. Further studies are required to better characterize outcomes in pregnant women with AML.","['Patel, Sunny J', 'Ajebo, Germame', 'Kota, Vamsi', 'Guddati, Achuta K']","['Patel SJ', 'Ajebo G', 'Kota V', 'Guddati AK']",,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University Augusta, GA 30909, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University Augusta, GA 30909, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University Augusta, GA 30909, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University Augusta, GA 30909, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200825,United States,Am J Blood Res,American journal of blood research,101569577,,,,PMC7486487,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'outcome', 'pregnancy', 'treatment']",2020/09/15 06:00,2020/09/15 06:01,['2020/09/14 05:53'],"['2020/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/14 05:53 [entrez]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Blood Res. 2020 Aug 25;10(4):68-75. eCollection 2020.,['AJBR Copyright (c) 2020.'],,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first is to diagnose cancer from healthy control, and the second is to identify the types of blood cancer. The chemometrics method combined with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) can be used for cancer detection. However, chemometrics methods were easily influenced by the spectral feature redundancy and noise, resulting in low accuracy rate because of their simple structure. We proposed an approach using LIBS combined with the ensemble learning based on the random subspace method (RSM). The serum samples were dripped onto a boric acid substrate for LIBS spectrum collection. The complete blood cancer sample set include leukemia [acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)], multiple myeloma (MM), and lymphoma. The results showed that the accuracy rates using k nearest neighbors (kNN) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) only were 88.14% and 94.45%, respectively, while using RSM with LDA (RSM-LDA), the average accuracy rate was improved from 94.45% to 98.34%. Furthermore, the variable importance of spectral lines (Na, K, Mg, Ca, H, O, N, C-N) were evaluated by the RSM-LDA model, which can improve the recognition ability of blood cancer types. Comparing the RSM-LDA model and only with LDA, the results showed that the average accuracy rate for cancer type identification was improved from 80.4% to 91.0%. These results demonstrate that LIBS combined with the RSM-LDA model can discriminate the blood cancer from the health control, as well as the recognition the types for blood cancers.","['Chu, YanWu', 'Chen, Feng', 'Sheng, Ziqian', 'Zhang, Deng', 'Zhang, Siyu', 'Wang, Weiliang', 'Jin, Honglin', 'Qi, Jianwei', 'Guo, LianBo']","['Chu Y', 'Chen F', 'Sheng Z', 'Zhang D', 'Zhang S', 'Wang W', 'Jin H', 'Qi J', 'Guo L']",,"['Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (WNLO), Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430074, China.', 'Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (WNLO), Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430074, China.', 'Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (WNLO), Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430074, China.', 'Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (WNLO), Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430074, China.', 'Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (WNLO), Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430074, China.', 'Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (WNLO), Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430074, China.', 'Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'qijianwei@ihcams.ac.cn.', 'Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics (WNLO), Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430074, China.', 'lbguo@hust.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200710,United States,Biomed Opt Express,Biomedical optics express,101540630,,,,PMC7449721,,,2020/09/15 06:00,2020/09/15 06:01,['2020/09/14 05:53'],"['2020/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/14 05:53 [entrez]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1364/BOE.395332 [doi]', '395332 [pii]']",epublish,Biomed Opt Express. 2020 Jul 10;11(8):4191-4202. doi: 10.1364/BOE.395332. eCollection 2020 Aug 1.,"['(c) 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access', 'Publishing Agreement.']",,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest related to this', 'article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell viability effect of Pd@W.tea-NPs, ""blank"" Pd nanoparticles, and white tea extract alone was determined in murine leukemia WEHI-3B cells and normal mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells). Apoptotic and cell cycle arrest effects of Pd@W.tea-NPs in WEHI-3B cells were evaluated. The effects of Pd@W.tea-NPs administered orally to leukemic mice at 50 and 100 mg/kg daily over 28 days were evaluated. Pd@W.tea-NPs reduced the viability of WHEI-3B cells with IC50 7.55 mug/ml at 72 h. Blank Pd nanoparticles and white tea extract alone had smaller effects on WHEI-3B viability and on normal fibroblasts. Pd@W.tea-NPs increased the proportion of Annexin V-positive WHEI-3B cells and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest. Leukemic cells in the spleen were reduced by Pd@W.tea-NPs with an increase in Bax/Bcl-2 and cytochrome-C protein and mRNA levels indicating the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. These effects replicated the effects of ATRA and were not observed using blank Pd nanoparticles. Pd@W.tea-NPs afford therapeutic efficacy against leukemia likely to pivot on activation of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptotic signaling and hence appear attractive potential candidates for development as a novel anticancer agent.","['Othman, Hemn', 'Rahman, Heshu', 'Mohan, Syam', 'Aziz, Sadat', 'Marif, Hardi', 'Ford, Dianne', 'Abdulsamad, Nozlena', 'Amin, Kawa', 'Abdullah, Rasedee']","['Othman H', 'Rahman H', 'Mohan S', 'Aziz S', 'Marif H', 'Ford D', 'Abdulsamad N', 'Amin K', 'Abdullah R']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4323-4459', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2077-1278', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2805-0996', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8597-874X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6625-508X']","['Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'College of Pharmacy, University of Sulaimani, Sulaymaniyah, Kurdistan Region, Iraq.', 'College of Medicine, University of Sulaimani, Sulaymaniyah, Kurdistan Region, Iraq.', 'College of Health Sciences, Komar University of Science and Technology, Chaq-Chaq Qularaisee, Sarchinar District, Sulaymaniyah, Kurdistan Region, Iraq.', 'Substance Abuse and Toxicology Research Center, Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Sulaimani, Sulaymaniyah, Kurdistan Region, Iraq.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Sulaimani, Sulaymaniyah, Kurdistan Region, Iraq.', 'Faculty of Health & Life Sciences, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Integrative Medicine Cluster, Institut Perubatan dan Pergigian Termaju (IPPT), Sains@BERTAM, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kepala Batas, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.', 'College of Medicine, University of Sulaimani, Sulaymaniyah, Kurdistan Region, Iraq.', 'Department of Medical Science, Respiratory, Allergy and Sleep Research, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200819,United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,PMC7453248,,,2020/09/15 06:00,2020/09/15 06:01,['2020/09/14 05:51'],"['2020/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/14 05:51 [entrez]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/8764096 [doi]'],epublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2020 Aug 19;2020:8764096. doi: 10.1155/2020/8764096. eCollection 2020.,['Copyright (c) 2020 Hemn Othman et al.'],,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the anti-leukemic effect of a well-known c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4 on a panel of hematologic malignant cells harboring either mutant or wild-type p53. Notably, we found that the suppression of c-Myc was coupled with the reduction in the survival of all the tested leukemic cells; however, as far as we are aware, this study suggests for the first time that the cytotoxic effect of 10058-F4 was not significantly affected by the molecular status of p53. Delving into the molecular mechanisms of the inhibitor in the most sensitive cell line revealed that 10058-F4 could induce apoptotic cell death in mutant p53-expressing NB4 cells through the suppression of NF-kappaB pathway coupled with a significant induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, we found that the anti-leukemic effect of 10058-F4 was overshadowed, at least partially, through the compensatory activation of the PI3K signaling pathway; highlighting a plausible attenuating role of this axis on 10058-F4 cytotoxicity. In conclusion, the results of the present study shed light on the favorable anti-leukemic effect of 10058-F4, especially in combination with PI3K inhibitors in acute promyelocytic leukemia; however, further investigations should be accomplished to determine the efficacy of the inhibitor, either as a single agent or in a combined-modal strategy, in leukemia treatment.","['Sayyadi, Mohammad', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Safa, Majid', 'Abolghasemi, Hassan', 'Momeny, Majid', 'Bashash, Davood']","['Sayyadi M', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Safa M', 'Abolghasemi H', 'Momeny M', 'Bashash D']",,"['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Pediatric Congenital Hematologic Disorders Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cancer Cell Signaling, Turku Center for Biotechnology, University of Turku and Abo Akademi University, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Pharm Res,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,101208407,,,,PMC7462502,['NOTNLM'],"['10058-F4', 'Autophagy', 'NF-kappaB pathway', 'PI3K pathway', 'c-Myc', 'p53']",2020/09/15 06:00,2020/09/15 06:01,['2020/09/14 05:51'],"['2020/09/14 05:51 [entrez]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22037/ijpr.2020.112926.14018 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran J Pharm Res. 2020 Winter;19(1):153-165. doi: 10.22037/ijpr.2020.112926.14018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune escape of AML cells is one of the underlying mechanisms mediating the relapse of the cancers. Various immunotherapies based on the 'patients' immune response to tumor cells have been developed to targeting the immune escape of AML cells, which lead to the minimal residual disease (MRD) after treatment. But the efficacy of those treatments or the combination of treatments remains unsatisfactory. Methods: A Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7 agonist SZU-106 was chemically synthesized. SZU-106 was conjugated to Decitabine (DAC), a demethylation agent, treated AML cells to construct tumor vaccine. The potency of the newly constructed AML cell vaccine, SZU-106-DAC-AML was tested in vitro and in vivo for the expression of tumor antigens and the activation level of immune responses. Results: Compared to the well characterized TLR7 agonist R848, SZU-106 has a comparable potency to activate TLR7 signaling pathway. SZU-106-DAC-AML, constructed by conjugating SZU-106 to DAC treated tumor cells, exhibited increased expression of tumor antigens, and enhanced the activation of DC cells and T cells in vitro and in vivo. The result of xenograft tumor model showed that SZU-106-DAC-AML tumor vaccine greatly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged animal survival. Conclusions: Conjugation of TLR7 agonist combined with up-regulation of tumor antigen expression improved the effectiveness of whole-cell tumor vaccine in AML.","['Zhong, Guocheng', 'Jin, Guangyi', 'Zeng, Wei', 'Yu, Changhua', 'Li, Yan', 'Zhou, Ji', 'Zhang, Li', 'Yu, Li']","['Zhong G', 'Jin G', 'Zeng W', 'Yu C', 'Li Y', 'Zhou J', 'Zhang L', 'Yu L']",,"['Department of Hematology and BMT center, the first Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital.

Some polymorphisms, as IL-6 -572C>G (rs1800796), IL-1beta -31 G>A (rs1143627), and CARD8 304T>A (rs2043211), in genes related to the inflammatory process, could affect the level of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) after chemotherapy. Since an efficient inflammatory process enhances neutrophil survival, we hypothesize that these polymorphisms are associated with ANC. Patients and Methods: We carried out a prospective cohort study in two hospitals in Santiago, Chile. The patients included were adults diagnosed with acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy. We use a multilevel linear regression model to test our hypothesis. The best model was selected using the Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Results: We analyzed 1726 hemograms and ANCs from 172 hospitalizations from 32 patients. The results show that CC and CG genotypes of IL-6 -572 C>G polymorphism are associated with higher ANCs compared with the GG genotype (Ln (ANC) ~ 0.81 IC95% 0.02-1.55). Similarly, TT and AT genotypes of CARD8 304T>A polymorphism were related to higher ANCs compared with AA (Ln (ANC) ~ 0.95 IC95% 0.02-1.82). IL-1beta genetic polymorphism had no statistically significant association with ANC. Conclusion: IL-6 rs1800796 -572C>G and CARD8 rs2043211 304T>A polymorphisms are associated with the absolute neutrophil count in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy for treatment of hematological malignancies. Our findings might be useful to improve the safety of chemotherapy through predictive ANC models.","['Martinez, Matias F', 'Alveal, Enzo', 'Soto, Tomas G', 'Bustamante, Eva I', 'Avila, Fernanda', 'Bangdiwala, Shrikant I', 'Flores, Ivonne', 'Benavides, Claudia', 'Morales, Ricardo', 'Varela, Nelson M', 'Quinones, Luis A']","['Martinez MF', 'Alveal E', 'Soto TG', 'Bustamante EI', 'Avila F', 'Bangdiwala SI', 'Flores I', 'Benavides C', 'Morales R', 'Varela NM', 'Quinones LA']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0498-6447', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3125-8608', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4784-9872', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5229-3007', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7967-5320']","['Laboratory of Chemical Carcinogenesis and Pharmacogenetics (CQF), Department of Basic and Clinical Oncology (DOBC), Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Latin American Network for the Implementation and Validation of Pharmacogenomic Clinical Guidelines (RELIVAF-CYTED), Madrid, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Chemical Carcinogenesis and Pharmacogenetics (CQF), Department of Basic and Clinical Oncology (DOBC), Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Laboratory of Chemical Carcinogenesis and Pharmacogenetics (CQF), Department of Basic and Clinical Oncology (DOBC), Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Departamento De Ciencias Basicas Santiago, Facultad De Ciencias, Universidad Santo Tomas, Santiago, Chile.', 'Cancer Institute Arturo Lopez Perez Foundation, Santiago, Chile.', 'Infectology Section, Medicine Department, Clinical Hospital of the University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Population Health Research Institute, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Cancer Institute Arturo Lopez Perez Foundation, Santiago, Chile.', 'Cancer Institute Arturo Lopez Perez Foundation, Santiago, Chile.', 'Cancer Institute Arturo Lopez Perez Foundation, Santiago, Chile.', 'Laboratory of Chemical Carcinogenesis and Pharmacogenetics (CQF), Department of Basic and Clinical Oncology (DOBC), Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Latin American Network for the Implementation and Validation of Pharmacogenomic Clinical Guidelines (RELIVAF-CYTED), Madrid, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Chemical Carcinogenesis and Pharmacogenetics (CQF), Department of Basic and Clinical Oncology (DOBC), Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Latin American Network for the Implementation and Validation of Pharmacogenomic Clinical Guidelines (RELIVAF-CYTED), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200819,New Zealand,Pharmgenomics Pers Med,Pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine,101514107,,,,PMC7450656,['NOTNLM'],"['CARD8 protein', 'hematological neoplasms', 'interleukin-6', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'neutropenia', 'pharmacogenetics']",2020/09/15 06:00,2020/09/15 06:01,['2020/09/14 05:49'],"['2020/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/14 05:49 [entrez]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/PGPM.S261208 [doi]', '261208 [pii]']",epublish,Pharmgenomics Pers Med. 2020 Aug 19;13:337-343. doi: 10.2147/PGPM.S261208. eCollection 2020.,['(c) 2020 Martinez et al.'],,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little studies investigated the expression and clinical implications of SNHGs in AML. Methods: Herein, we systemically determined the prognostic role of the expression of SNHG family members in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Results: Among the expression of all SNHG family members, we identified that only SNHG7 and SNHG12 expression were found to have prognostic effects on overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) in AML by Cox regression univariate analysis. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that SNHG7 higher-expressed cases had markedly longer OS and LFS time than SNHG7 lower-expressed cases, whereas SNHG12 higher-expressed cases had markedly shorter OS and LFS time than SNHG12 lower-expressed cases. Interestingly, SNHG7 and SNHG12 expression were also associated with several prognosis-related clinical/molecular features such as white blood cell counts, FAB/cytogenetic classifications, IDH1 mutation, RUNX1 mutation, and NPM1 mutation. Despite the associations, Cox regression multivariate analysis confirmed the independent prognostic impact of SNHG7 and SNHG12 expression in AML. Notably, we further validated that both SNHG7 and SNHG12 expression was significantly increased in newly diagnosed AML patients.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the sex-specific associations between height and 24 site-specific cancers and to assess whether the association differed by IGF-1. METHODS: In total, 414,923 participants from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study were included. The association of height (per 5-cm increment) with incidence and mortality from 24 cancer sites was investigated by using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 6.0 years. In men, height was positively associated with incidence risk of all-cause cancer and at five sites (lung, lymphatic, leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and melanoma). In women, it was associated with breast, melanoma, lymphatic, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and all-cause cancer. The association was stronger in women than men for all-cause cancer incidence.

However, some of these associations were sex-specific. There was no strong evidence to support IGF-1 moderating the association between height and cancer.","['Parra-Soto, Solange', 'Ho, Frederick K', 'Pell, Jill P', 'Celis-Morales, Carlos']","['Parra-Soto S', 'Ho FK', 'Pell JP', 'Celis-Morales C']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2612-3917'],"['Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8RZ, UK.', 'Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8TA, UK.', 'Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8RZ, UK.', 'Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8RZ, UK.', 'Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, G12 8RZ, UK.

Although the biological features of BFV are not well understood, appearance of clinical manifestation by superinfection with other microorganisms is inferred. In Japan, reports of genomic characterizations and epidemiology of this virus are limited. In this study, we performed whole genomic sequencing of BFV strains Ibaraki and No.43, which were isolated in this country. Additionally, we investigated BFV in geographically distant four daily farms in Japan, to estimate the distribution of BFV and its correlation to bovine leukemia virus (BLV). BFV was distributed throughout Japan; the average positive rate was 12.7%. The nucleotide sequence identities of the isolates were 99.6% when compared with BFV strain isolated in the USA. The phylogenetic tree using env gene sequence showed strains Ibaraki, No.43 and Kagoshima were sorted in the same cluster including the USA and Chinese strains, while Hokkaido strain was in the other cluster including European strains. Although no clear correlation between BFV and BLV could be found, BFV and BLV infections were likely to increase with ages. Our data on epidemiology and characteristics of BFV will provide important information to reveal biological features of BFV.","['Okamoto, Mari', 'Oguma, Keisuke', 'Yamashita-Kawanishi, Nanako', 'Ichijo, Toshihiro', 'Hatama, Shinichi', 'Endo, Maiko', 'Ishikawa, Maya', 'Haga, Takeshi']","['Okamoto M', 'Oguma K', 'Yamashita-Kawanishi N', 'Ichijo T', 'Hatama S', 'Endo M', 'Ishikawa M', 'Haga T']",,"['Division of Infection Control and Disease Prevention, Department of Veterinary Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Epizootiology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Nihon University, 1866 Kameino, Fujisawa, Kanagawa 252-0880, Japan.', 'Division of Infection Control and Disease Prevention, Department of Veterinary Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.', 'Iwate University Faculty of Agriculture Veterinary Medicine, 3-18-8 Ueda, Morioka, Iwate 020-8550, Japan.', 'National Institute of Animal Health, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0856, Japan.', 'Animal Resource Science Center, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Science, The University of Tokyo, 3145 Yorii, Kasama, Ibaraki 319-0206, Japan.', 'Private investigator, Izumimachi, Shikaoi, Katogun, Hokkaido 081-0212, Japan.', 'Division of Infection Control and Disease Prevention, Department of Veterinary Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200914,Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', '*Cattle Diseases/epidemiology', '*Enzootic Bovine Leukosis', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'Japan/epidemiology', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Phylogeny', '*Spumavirus/genetics']",PMC7719878,['NOTNLM'],"['bovine foamy virus', 'bovine leukemia virus', 'epidemiology']",2020/09/15 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2020/09/14 05:47'],"['2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/14 05:47 [entrez]']",['10.1292/jvms.20-0429 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 2020 Nov 12;82(11):1607-1613. doi: 10.1292/jvms.20-0429.

This study analyzed the incidence and risk factors for IFIs in these patients, evaluated clinical patterns in antifungal prophylaxis, and assessed the diagnostic utility of tests in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 117 newly diagnosed patients with AML treated with HMAs at our center, divided into groups based on concern for IFI (cIFI: all possible, probable, and proven IFIs) versus no concern for IFI. The Fisher exact test compared patients with cIFI versus without, and a multivariable logistic regression model estimated odds for cIFI. RESULTS: Sixty-seven (57%) patients had cIFI, with 48 possible IFIs, 17 probable, and 2 proven cases. There was no difference in incidence based on home zip code, but the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was highly associated with cIFI (P = .001), as was male gender (P = .01). Neutropenia at treatment initiation was borderline in significance (P = .08). In diagnostics, 9% of patients had positive serum fungal markers, and 30 patients underwent bronchoscopy, with only 27% of cases yielding positive results. There was a difference in treatment regimens between patients receiving antifungal prophylaxis with mold coverage versus without mold coverage with respect to cIFI (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: cIFI in patients with AML treated with HMAs remains significant, especially in males and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who were found to be at higher risk. This may prompt clinicians to consider anti-mold prophylaxis in this setting.","['Ozga, Michael', 'Huang, Ying', 'Blachly, James S', 'Grieselhuber, Nicole R', 'Wall, Sarah', 'Larkin, Karilyn', 'Haque, Tamanna', 'Walker, Alison R', 'Bhatnagar, Bhavana', 'Behbehani, Gregory', 'Vasu, Sumithira', 'Maakaron, Joseph E', 'Lustberg, Mark', 'Mims, Alice S']","['Ozga M', 'Huang Y', 'Blachly JS', 'Grieselhuber NR', 'Wall S', 'Larkin K', 'Haque T', 'Walker AR', 'Bhatnagar B', 'Behbehani G', 'Vasu S', 'Maakaron JE', 'Lustberg M', 'Mims AS']",,"['Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Infectious Disease, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH.

Commercial bacterial ASNases increase patient survival, but the consequent immunological reactions remain a challenge. Yeasts ASNase is closer to human congeners and could lead to lower side effects. Among 134 yeast strains isolated from marine-sediments in King George Island, Antarctica, nine were L-asparaginase producing yeasts and glutaminase-free. Leucosporidium muscorum CRM 1648 yielded the highest ASNase activity (490.41 U.L(-1)) and volumetric productivity (5.12 U.L(-1) h(-1)). Sucrose, yeast extract and proline were the best carbon and nitrogen sources to support growth and ASNase production. A full factorial design analysis pointed the optimum media condition for yeast growth and ASNase yield: 20 g L(-1) sucrose, 15 g L(-1) yeast extract and 20 g L(-1) proline, which resulted in 4582.5 U L(-1) and 63.64 U L(-1) h(-1) of ASNase and volumetric productivity, respectively. Analysis of temperature, pH, inoculum and addition of seawater indicated the best condition for ASNase production by this yeast: 12-15 degrees C, pH 5.5-6.5 and seawater >25% (v/v). Inoculum concentration seems not to interfere.

METHODS: A total of 65 epilepsy patients were enrolled as the epilepsy group from the hospital between May 2017 and February 2019. A control group was formed by 30 healthy volunteers at the same period and in the same area whose basic data matched with those of the epileptic patients. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Form (MoCA). Time and frequency of epileptic seizures were recorded in epileptic group. Within 6 hours following the attack, blood tests were carried out to measure the hydrolysis rates of serum adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP), phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity, and levels of serum NSE, S100B and Bcl-2. The relationship of these indexes with the time of epileptic seizure and MoCA total score was analyzed. RESULTS: The epilepsy group included 18 cases (27.69%) with cognitive dysfunction. The time and frequency of epileptic seizure in the patients with cognitive dysfunction was significantly higher than that of patients without cognitive dysfunction, while the total MoCA score was significantly lower with cognitive dysfunction than that without (P<0.05). The total MoCA score of epileptic patients with and without cognitive dysfunction was significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). The hydrolysis rates of ATP, ADP and AMP, PDE activity, and serum NES, S100B and Bcl-2 levels in patients with cognitive dysfunction were significantly higher than those without cognitive dysfunction (P<0.05). The above serum indexes of the patients were significantly higher than those of people in the control group (P<0.05). Spearman's correlation analysis showed that hydrolysis rates of serum ATP, ADP and AMP, PDE activity, and serum NES, S100B and Bcl-2 levels were positively correlated with time and frequency of epileptic seizure (P<0.05), and negatively correlated with total MoCA score (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The cognitive function of epilepsy patients is significantly decreased compared with that of healthy individuals. Serum ATPase activity, along with serum NES, S100B and Bcl-2 levels, is associated with time and frequency of epileptic seizure and cognitive function after attack.","['Zhang, Yi', 'Zhang, Shanshan', 'Ji, Yifei', 'Yang, Xu', 'Liu, Pingping', 'Yu, Gang']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhang S', 'Ji Y', 'Yang X', 'Liu P', 'Yu G']",,"['Department of Neurology, Nanchong Central Hospital, Nanchong, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Nanchong Central Hospital, Nanchong, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Nanchong Central Hospital, Nanchong, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Nanchong Central Hospital, Nanchong, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Nanchong Central Hospital, Nanchong, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. wing_z_y3@126.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200903,China,Ann Palliat Med,Annals of palliative medicine,101585484,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (S100 Calcium Binding Protein beta Subunit)', '0 (S100B protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 4.2.1.11 (Phosphopyruvate Hydratase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases', 'Biomarkers', 'Cognition', '*Epilepsy', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', '*Lymphoma, B-Cell', 'Neurons', 'Phosphopyruvate Hydratase', 'S100 Calcium Binding Protein beta Subunit', 'Seizures']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ATPase activity', 'B-cell lymphoma/leukemia (Bcl)', 'Epilepsy', 'cognitive function', 'neuron-specific enolase (NSE)']",2020/09/15 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/14 05:29'],"['2020/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/14 05:29 [entrez]']","['apm-20-1494 [pii]', '10.21037/apm-20-1494 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Palliat Med. 2020 Sep;9(5):3366-3372. doi: 10.21037/apm-20-1494.

Afterwards, the effect of D-serine, retinoic acid (RA) and MK801 on spermatogenesis development was investigated. The animals were injected a single dose (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) of busulfan. After confirming the model, ten 5-day-old NMRI mice were used as spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) transplantation donors. The SSCs were confirmed by detecting the promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein. Then, tissue culture of the azoospermia model which had received SSCs was performed in various conditions (seven groups). The apoptosis markers levels of cells were significantly decreased in differentiation media containing RA and serine. In contrast, the expression of apoptotic markers including caspase 3, caspase 9 and Bax was increased in the presence of MK801. In conclusion, a new in vitro system capable of producing mature spermatozoa was developed that would be useful for investigating the medicinal effects of agents on the male reproductive system. Also, a comparison of spermatogenesis development in different media revealed that the presence of D-serine and RA (retinoic acid) in the culture medium has a positive effect on spermatogenesis.","['Modirshanechi, Ghazaleh', 'Eslampour, Mohammad Amin', 'Abdolmaleki, Zohreh']","['Modirshanechi G', 'Eslampour MA', 'Abdolmaleki Z']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8384-7877'],"['Department of Clinical Science, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Karaj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Karaj, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200913,Germany,Andrologia,Andrologia,0423506,"['0 (Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Organ Culture Techniques', '*Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate', 'Spermatogenesis', '*Spermatogonia', 'Testis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['NMDA receptor', 'differentiation', 'germ cell', 'spermatogonia']",2020/09/14 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/09/13 20:43'],"['2020/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/13 20:43 [entrez]']",['10.1111/and.13764 [doi]'],ppublish,Andrologia. 2020 Dec;52(11):e13764. doi: 10.1111/and.13764.

However, there remain several subtypes of ALL that represent significant therapeutic challenges. Here, we review the current evidence guiding treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+), Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-L), and early T-precursor (ETP) ALL in the AYA population. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical trials in Ph + ALL have demonstrated the superior efficacy of second- and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to induce and maintain remission. Current efforts now focus on determining the durability of these remissions and which patients will benefit from transplant. For Ph-like and ETP ALL, recent studies are investigating the addition of novel agents to standard treatment. The treatment of Ph + ALL has significantly improved with the addition of potent TKIs. However, the treatment of Ph-like and ETP ALL remains a challenge. At this time, the judicious use of allogenic transplant is the only current approach to modify this increased risk.","['Prescott, Kevin', 'Jacobs, Michael', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Wynne, Joseph']","['Prescott K', 'Jacobs M', 'Stock W', 'Wynne J']",,"['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, 900 E. 57th Street, 8th Floor, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, 900 E. 57th Street, 8th Floor, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, 900 E. 57th Street, 8th Floor, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine, 900 E. 57th Street, 8th Floor, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA. joseph.p.wynne@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC8279222,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*AYA', '*ETP', '*Ph + ALL', '*Ph-like']",2020/09/14 06:00,2021/06/02 06:00,['2020/09/13 20:41'],"['2020/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/13 20:41 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-020-00597-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-020-00597-y [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2020 Dec;15(6):424-435. doi: 10.1007/s11899-020-00597-y.,,['K12 CA139160/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['NIHMS1628682'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are used to treat patients with CML. The addition of pegylated interferon-alpha2b to imatinib or dasatinib results in promising deep molecular responses. Because imatinib shows poor penetration into the central nervous system (CNS), the CNS may become a sanctuary site in patients on prolonged imatinib therapy for CML. It is extremely rare for the blast phase in patients with chronic phase CML to affect the CNS without concomitant bone marrow involvement. CASE REPORT This report describes a 57-year-old woman who was diagnosed with accelerated phase (AP) CML and failed high dose imatinib therapy. Despite achieving an excellent molecular response to dasatinib in 6 months, she developed recurrent isolated CNS blast crisis. Survival was prolonged after treatment with intrathecal chemotherapy and whole-brain radiation therapy combined with dasatinib. After achieving long and deep molecular remission with dasatinib and a few months of pegylated interferon-alpha2a, she lived for 18 months in treatment-free-remission (TFR). At age 65 years, she died of progressive rectal carcinoma with septic shock, cancer-related venous thromboembolism, and a possible autoimmune disorder. CONCLUSIONS This patient with accelerated phase CML and 2 isolated CNS blast crises died in TFR 8.5 years after her initial diagnosis and 7.5 years after her first isolated CNS blast crisis. Survival resulted from tailoring of therapies around her comorbidities.","['Bin Salman, Ahmed A', 'Zaidi, Abdul Rehman Zia', 'Altaf, Syed Yasir', 'AlShehry, Nawal F', 'Tailor, Imran K', 'Motabi, Ibraheem H', 'Zaidi, Syed Ziauddin A']","['Bin Salman AA', 'Zaidi ARZ', 'Altaf SY', 'AlShehry NF', 'Tailor IK', 'Motabi IH', 'Zaidi SZA']",,"['Department of Adult Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT), King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Adult Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT), King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Medicine, Alfaisal University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Adult Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT), King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Adult Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT), King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Adult Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT), King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Adult Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT), King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Adult Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT), King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200913,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis', '*Brain Neoplasms', 'Central Nervous System', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use']",PMC7508307,,,2020/09/14 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/13 20:41'],"['2020/09/13 20:41 [entrez]', '2020/09/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['922971 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.922971 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2020 Sep 13;21:e922971. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.922971.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crocin (CRO) possesses abundant pharmacological and biological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic. This study examined the cardioprotective effects of crocin and explored their mechanistic involvement in ATO-induced cardiotoxicity. Forty-eight male rats were treated with ATO to induce cardiotoxicity. In combination with ATO, CRO were given to evaluate its cardioprotection. The results demonstrated that CRO administration not only diminished QTc prolongation, myocardial enzymes and Troponin T levels but also improved histopathological results. CRO administration reduced reactive oxygen species generation. However, the CRO administration caused an increase in glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase and total sulphydryl levels and a decrease in malondialdehyde content, gamma glutamyl transferase and lipid hydroperoxides levels and proinflammatory cytokines. Importantly, immunohistochemical analysis, real time PCR and western blotting showed a reduction in Caspase-3 and Bcl-2-associated X protein expressions and enhancement of B cell lymphoma-2 expression. Real time PCR and western blotting showed a reduction in proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, CRO caused an activation in nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2, leading to enhanced Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, heme oxygenase-1 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide quinone dehydrogenase 1 expressions involved in Nrf2 signaling during ATO-induced cardiotoxicity. CRO was shown to ameliorate ATO-induced cardiotoxicity. The mechanisms for CRO amelioration of cardiotoxicity due to inflammation, oxidative damage, and apoptosis may occur via an up-regulated Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.","['Liang, Yingran', 'Zheng, Bin', 'Li, Jinghan', 'Shi, Jing', 'Chu, Li', 'Han, Xue', 'Chu, Xi', 'Zhang, Xuan', 'Zhang, Jianping']","['Liang Y', 'Zheng B', 'Li J', 'Shi J', 'Chu L', 'Han X', 'Chu X', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang J']",,"['School of Pharmacy, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, 050200, Hebei, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, 050200, Hebei, China.', 'School of Basic Medicine, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, 050200, Hebei, China.', 'The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, 050011, Hebei, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, 050200, Hebei, China; Hebei Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine Research on Cardio-Cerebrovascular Disease, Shijiazhuang, 050200, Hebei, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, 050200, Hebei, China.', 'The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, 050011, Hebei, China.

However, this therapy can cause severe side effects as well as drug resistance, hence calling for new therapeutic strategies. As c-MYC and BCL-2 are often overexpressed in AML, and synergism between c-MYC and BCL-2 promotes tumorigenesis, therefore, dual targeting of c-MYC/BCL-2 promoter G-quadruplexes (G4s) and then inhibiting the targeted gene expression would be a potential strategy in ALM treatment. In this work, in the search of dual ligands, we performed a screening assay with an in-house, imidazole-based compound library. Consequently, two drug-like biimidazole derivatives were identified as selective c-MYC/BCL-2 G4 binders, of which, BIM-2 was selected as the candidate for inhibiting AML cell growth. Then, BIM-2 was demonstrated to downregulate both c-MYC and BCL-2 expression, and thereby cause cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and apoptosis in AML cells. Furthermore, the possible end-stacking binding modes between BIM-2 and c-MYC/BCL-2 G4s were revealed by NMR and molecular docking studies. Accordingly, this study provides a new class of drug-like dual-selective c-MYC/BCL-2 G4 ligands for the potential treatment of AML.","['Hu, Ming-Hao', 'Yu, Bing-Ying', 'Wang, Xiaodong', 'Jin, Guangyi']","['Hu MH', 'Yu BY', 'Wang X', 'Jin G']",,"['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen 518060, China.

METHODS: Multicenter retrospective case series. Inclusion criteria were RA defined by the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria and LGLL defined by absolute LGL count >/= 0.3x10(9)/L with evidence of an expanded clonal LGL population (flow cytometry, TCR-gamma polymerase chain reaction, or Stat3 mutation). RESULTS: Fourteen patients (10 women, mean age 55.2 +/- 14.2 years) included; 13 were seropositive for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (n=11) or rheumatoid factor (n=10). LGLL diagnosis was made 9.5 [IQR: 3.25;15.5] years after RA diagnosis. Thirteen patients had T-LGLL. Rituximab was the first-line therapy for LGLL for 4 patients. Previous treatment lines included methotrexate (n=7), cyclophosphamide (n=2), cyclosporin A (n=1), or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (n=4). Rituximab was used in monotherapy (n=8) or associated to methotrexate (n=3), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (n=2), or alkylating agents (n=1). The number of rituximab cycles ranged from 1 to 11 (median 6), with high heterogeneity in dosing regimens. Median duration response after rituximab initiation was 35 [IQR: 23.5;41] months. The overall response rate was 100%: 8 patients experienced complete response (normalization of blood count and LGL </= 0.3x10(9)/L) and 6 experienced partial responses (improvement in blood counts without complete normalization). The tolerance profile was good, with no infectious complications. CONCLUSION: rituximab appears as a valuable therapeutic option for RA-associated LGLL.","['Lobbes, Herve', 'Dervout, Charles', 'Toussirot, Eric', 'Felten, Renaud', 'Sibilia, Jean', 'Wendling, Daniel', 'Gombert, Bruno', 'Ruivard, Marc', 'Grobost, Vincent', 'Saraux, Alain', 'Cornec, Divi', 'Verhoeven, Frank', 'Soubrier, Martin']","['Lobbes H', 'Dervout C', 'Toussirot E', 'Felten R', 'Sibilia J', 'Wendling D', 'Gombert B', 'Ruivard M', 'Grobost V', 'Saraux A', 'Cornec D', 'Verhoeven F', 'Soubrier M']",,"['Internal medicine department, Estaing University Hospital, 1 place Lucie et Raymond Aubrac, Clermont-Ferrand, France..

The oil extracted from its seeds is recognized in traditional medicine and has high anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential, which are the basic prerequisites for a therapeutic agent that can be used in the treatment of oral mucositis (OM). Moreover, the aforementioned oil has antimicrobial, antiallergic, and parasiticidal actions and is effective in the management of cutaneous and muscular dysfunctions. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the therapeutic effects of andiroba gel (Carapa guianensis Aubl) on the symptomatology and evolution of OM in children with leukemia who underwent chemotherapy and to compare it to the effects of low power laser. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind clinical trial involved 60 patients of both genders with leukemia, with age ranging from six to twelve years. The patients were divided into two study groups: the andiroba group (n = 30) and the laser group (n = 30). The level of pain experienced by the patients was assessed using the Wong-Baker visual analog scale and the degree of severity of OM was assessed using a table, recommended by the World Health Organization, that depicts the degrees of severity of OM. The data obtained were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test, with statistical significance indicated by a P value less than or equal to 0.05. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction in the degree of OM was observed on the fourth, fifth, and sixth days and in the pain scores on the second, third, and fourth days in the andiroba group after the manifestation of OM, compared to the laser group. CONCLUSIONS: The use of andiroba oil effectively reduced the severity of OM and relieved pain, which resulted in a decrease in the severity of signs and symptoms in the patients in the andiroba group, compared to the laser group.","['Soares, Artur Dos Santos', 'Wanzeler, Ana Marcia Viana', 'Cavalcante, Gabriel Henrique Soares', 'Barros, Elsa Maria da Silva', 'Carneiro, Rita de Cassia Matos', 'Tuji, Fabricio Mesquita']","['Soares ADS', 'Wanzeler AMV', 'Cavalcante GHS', 'Barros EMDS', 'Carneiro RCM', 'Tuji FM']",,"['Department of Odontology, Federal University of Para, Street Augusto Correa, Number 01, 66075-110, Belem, PA, Brazil.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 122 patients with BCR-ABL1-negative CMPN underwent transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) evaluation at the beginning of study. Patients undergoing PHT on TTE examination were also evaluated by a pulmonologist. Patients were divided into 3 groups. Group A comprised patients with CMPN-related PHT; group B, patients with no PHT; and group C, patients with PHT due to secondary causes. Patients were evaluated again every 3 to 6 months. RESULTS: PHT was detected in 33 (27%) of 122 patients. Eight (6.5%) had CMPN-related PHT and the remaining 25 (20.5%) had non-CMPN-related PHT. Positivity for JAK2 V617F mutation in the study population was 72.9%. Groups were similar with respect to hematologic parameters and gender. Follow-up times were as follows: median (range) time from diagnosis to TTE and study end were 34 (1-158) months and 107 (16-251) months, respectively, and from TTE to study end was 88 (7-110) months. No significant differences found among the groups in terms of median time from diagnosis to TTE, follow-up, and overall survival. CONCLUSION: BCR-ABL1-negative CMPN patients had a lower prevalence of PHT compared to earlier studies.

We report a case of small bowel perforation associated with gastrointestinal GVHD and CMV enteritis in a patient with leukemia who was successfully treated surgically. A 39-year-old man presented with intestinal perforation necessitating emergency surgical intervention. He was diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and developed severe gastrointestinal GVHD and CMV enteritis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. His terminal ileum showed a perforation with diffuse wall thinning, and petechiae were observed over long segments of the distal ileum and the proximal colon. Small bowel segmental resection and a subtotal colectomy with a double-barreled ileocolostomy were performed. The patient recovered uneventfully after the operation.

Crocetin (Crt) possesses antioxidant and antiapoptosis properties, and has certain renal protective effects, but it has not been reported that it has protective effect on renal injury caused by ATO. The current study explored the effects and mechanisms of Crt on kidney damage induced by ATO. Fifty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups. Adult rats were given Crt concurrently with ATO for 1 week. On the 8th day, rats were killed and blood and kidney tissues were collected. Histopathological changes were measured, and kidneytissues and serum were used to determine renal function and antioxidant enzyme activity. In addition, the protein expression levels of P-PI3K, PI3K, P-AKT, AKT, CytC, Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 were determined via western blot analysis. Results revealed ATO induced renal morphological alterations and activated serum BUN and CRE. Compared with the control group, ROS, MDA, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, protein carbonyls (PC), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) and arsenic concentration levels were found to be significantly increased and SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, GSH and total sulphydryl groups (TSH) levels were attenuated in the ATO group. Crt markedly reduced oxidative stress in ATO-induced nephrotoxicity. Further, ATO induced apoptosis by significantly enhancing CytC, Bax and Caspase-3 and inhibiting Bcl-2. Administration with Crt markedly improved the expression of apoptosis factor. Moreover, Crt treatment stimulated the expressions of P-PI3K, PI3K, P-AKT, AKT induced by ATO. This study indicates Crt could prevent renal injury caused by ATO through inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis, and its mechanism may be related to activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.","['Liu, Panpan', 'Xue, Yurun', 'Zheng, Bin', 'Liang, Yingran', 'Zhang, Jianping', 'Shi, Jing', 'Chu, Xi', 'Han, Xue', 'Chu, Li']","['Liu P', 'Xue Y', 'Zheng B', 'Liang Y', 'Zhang J', 'Shi J', 'Chu X', 'Han X', 'Chu L']",,"['School of Pharmacy, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang 050200, Hebei, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang 050200, Hebei, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang 050200, Hebei, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang 050200, Hebei, China.', 'School of Basic Medicine, Hebei University of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang 050200, Hebei, China.', 'The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China.', 'The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050011, Hebei, China.

The immunoglobulin-like inhibitory receptors, LILRB1 and LILRB4, are expressed on monocytes but have not yet been systematically evaluated in the clinical setting. METHODS: We evaluated the diagnostic performance of LILRB1 and LILRB4 as monocytic markers for both immature and mature monocytes in comparison to other myelomonocytic markers including CD14, CD15, CD33, CD36, and CD64 in eight cases of control bone marrow (BM, 5) and peripheral blood (PB, 3), 64 cases of (M-AML), and 57 cases of AML without monocytic differentiation (NM-AML) by flow cytometric immunophenotyping. RESULTS: In control BM, LILRB1 and LILRB4 were consistently expressed on monocytes at all stages of maturation, from CD34(+) /CD14(-) monocytic precursors to CD14(-/dim+) maturing and CD14(+) mature monocytes. In M-AML, LILRB1 and LILRB4 were consistently expressed on monocytes, regardless of the degree of maturity, from CD14(-/dim+) monoblasts/promonocytes to CD14(+) mature monocytes but were not expressed on myeloblasts. The diagnostic performances as a monocytic marker assessed by sensitivity/specificity were 100%/100% for LILRB1/LILRB4, 100%/82% for CD11b, 80%/100% for CD14, 100%/81% for CD64, 100%/58% for CD15/CD33, and 89%/97% for CD36/CD64. CONCLUSION: The co-expression of LILRB1/LILRB4 outperformed other myelomonocytic markers as a highly sensitive and specific marker for monocytes at all stages of maturation and could reliably distinguish M-AML from NM-AML. LILRB4 additionally represents a novel therapeutic target for treating M-AML.","['Churchill, Hywyn R O', 'Fuda, Franklin S', 'Xu, Jing', 'Deng, Mi', 'Zhang, Cheng Cheng', 'An, Zhiqiang', 'Zhang, Ningyan', 'Chen, Pu', 'Bergstrom, Colin', 'Kansagra, Ankit', 'Collins, Robert', 'John, Samuel', 'Koduru, Prasad', 'Chen, Weina']","['Churchill HRO', 'Fuda FS', 'Xu J', 'Deng M', 'Zhang CC', 'An Z', 'Zhang N', 'Chen P', 'Bergstrom C', 'Kansagra A', 'Collins R', 'John S', 'Koduru P', 'Chen W']",,"['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200912,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Identifying BRAF alterations in pediatric cancers is critically important as therapeutic agents targeting BRAF or MEK may be incorporated into the clinical management of these patients. In this study, we performed comprehensive genomic profiling on 3,633 pediatric cancer samples and identified a cohort of 221 (6.1%) cases with known or novel alterations in BRAF or RAF1 detected in extracranial solid tumors, brain tumors, or hematological malignancies. Eighty percent (176/221) of these tumors had a known-activating short variant (98, 55.7%), fusion (72, 40.9%), or insertion/deletion (6, 3.4%). Among BRAF altered cancers, the most common tumor types were brain tumors (74.4%), solid tumors (10.8%), hematological malignancies (9.1%), sarcomas (3.4%), and extracranial embryonal tumors (2.3%). RAF1 fusions containing intact RAF1 kinase domain (encoded by exons 10-17) were identified in seven tumors, including two novel fusions TMF1-RAF1 and SOX6-RAF1. Additionally, we highlight a subset of patients with brain tumor with positive clinical response to BRAF inhibitors, demonstrating the rationale for incorporating precision medicine into pediatric oncology. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Precision medicine has not yet gained a strong foothold in pediatric cancers. This study describes the landscape of BRAF and RAF1 genomic alterations across a diverse spectrum of pediatric cancers, primarily brain tumors, but also encompassing melanoma, sarcoma, several types of hematologic malignancy, and others. Given the availability of multiple U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved BRAF inhibitors, identification of these alterations may assist with treatment decision making, as described here in three cases of pediatric cancer.","['Rankin, Andrew', 'Johnson, Adrienne', 'Roos, Alison', 'Kannan, Geoffrey', 'Knipstein, Jeffrey', 'Britt, Nicholas', 'Rosenzweig, Mark', 'Haberberger, James', 'Pavlick, Dean', 'Severson, Eric', 'Vergilio, Jo-Anne', 'Squillace, Rachel', 'Erlich, Rachel', 'Sathyan, Pratheesh', 'Cramer, Stuart', 'Kram, David', 'Ross, Jeffrey', 'Miller, Vince', 'Reddy, Prasanth', 'Alexander, Brian', 'Ali, Siraj M', 'Ramkissoon, Shakti']","['Rankin A', 'Johnson A', 'Roos A', 'Kannan G', 'Knipstein J', 'Britt N', 'Rosenzweig M', 'Haberberger J', 'Pavlick D', 'Severson E', 'Vergilio JA', 'Squillace R', 'Erlich R', 'Sathyan P', 'Cramer S', 'Kram D', 'Ross J', 'Miller V', 'Reddy P', 'Alexander B', 'Ali SM', 'Ramkissoon S']",,"['Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Pediatric Specialists of Virginia, Falls Church, Virginia, USA.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Morrisville, North, Carolina, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Morrisville, North, Carolina, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Morrisville, North, Carolina, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'University of South Carolina School of Medicine, Columbia, South Carolina, USA.', 'Wake Forest Pediatric Oncology, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Foundation Medicine Inc., Morrisville, North, Carolina, USA.', 'Wake Forest Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Pathology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200925,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Raf1 protein, human)']",IM,"['*Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Melanoma', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*genetics', '*Sarcoma', '*Soft Tissue Neoplasms']",PMC7794197,['NOTNLM'],"['*Biomarkers', '*Brain neoplasms', '*Leukemia', '*Pediatrics', '*Precision medicine', '*Proteins B-raf', '*Proto-oncogene', '*Tumor']",2020/09/13 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/09/12 12:07'],"['2019/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/12 12:07 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ONCO.13519 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2021 Jan;26(1):e153-e163. doi: 10.1002/ONCO.13519.

Data are scarce on acute liver dysfunction (ALD), despite HM patients cumulating risk factors. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to assess the prevalence of ALD in critically ill HM patients and its impact on outcome. Data of all patients with HM admitted to the medical ICU between 2008 and 2018 were extracted from electronic medical records. ALD was defined by ALT > 165 U/L, AST > 230 U/L, or total bilirubin > 4 mg/dL. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyze hospital mortality. Charts of survivors with ALD were reviewed to assess impact of ALD on subsequent anti-cancer treatment. We included 971 patients (60% male), age 64 (54-72) years, of whom 196 (20%) developed ALD. ALD patients were younger, more frequently had liver cirrhosis or acute leukemia, and had increased severity of illness and vital organ support needs. ALD was associated with hospital mortality in univariate (OR 4.14, 95% CI 2.95-5.80, p < 0.001) and multivariate analysis (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.07-3.24, p = 0.03). Hospital mortality was 46% in ALD patients; among 106 survivors, a third of patients requiring therapy received it as previously planned, and half of the patients were alive at 1 year. In summary, in a large population of critically ill patients with hematological malignancies, 20% developed ALD, which was an independent risk factor for hospital mortality and occasionally altered further anti-cancer treatment.","['Van de Louw, Andry', 'Twomey, Kathleen', 'Habecker, Nicholas', 'Rakszawski, Kevin']","['Van de Louw A', 'Twomey K', 'Habecker N', 'Rakszawski K']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2260-2005'],"['Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Penn State Health Hershey Medical Center, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA. avandelouw@pennstatehealth.psu.edu.', 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Penn State Health Hershey Medical Center, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Penn State Health Hershey Medical Center, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Penn State Health Hershey Medical Center, 500 University Dr, Hershey, PA, 17033, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200912,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Critical Illness/*mortality/therapy', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Hospital Mortality/trends', 'Humans', 'Liver Failure, Acute/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute liver dysfunction', 'Chemotherapy', 'Critical care', 'Hematological malignancy', 'Mortality']",2020/09/13 06:00,2021/01/14 06:00,['2020/09/12 12:05'],"['2020/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/12 12:05 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-04197-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-04197-x [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2021 Jan;100(1):229-237. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-04197-x.

Tax1 protein of HTLV-I can induce malignant proliferation of T-cells by modulating the expression of growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Here, we aimed to investigate the proviral load (PVL) of HTLV-I in ATL and also to evaluate the mRNA expression of B chain of PDGF and PDGF-beta receptors in ATL patients and HTLV-I-infected healthy carriers. To this end, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by using Ficoll-Histophaque density centrifugation. The mean of HTLV-I PVL in ATL patients (42,759 +/- 15,737 copies/10(4) cells [95% CI, 9557-75962]) was significantly (p = .01) higher than that in healthy carriers (650 +/- 107 copies/10(4) cells [95% CI, 422-879], respectively. The HTLV-I PVL in ATL patients exhibited a significant correlation with PBMC count (R = .495, p = .001). The mRNA expression of Tax, B chain of PDGF, and PDGF-beta receptor genes was significantly higher in healthy carriers than in patients with ATL. In conclusion, the expression of the canonical PDGFbeta and its receptor, and their correlation with Tax expression cannot be a suitable indicator and/or prognostic factor for progression of ATL in HTLV-I carriers.","['Atabati, Hadi', 'Esmaeili, Seyed-Alireza', 'Allahyari, Abolghasem', 'Shirdel, Abbas', 'Rahimi, Hossein', 'Rezaee, Seyed Abdolrahim', 'Momtazi-Borojeni, Amir A', 'Rafatpanah, Houshang']","['Atabati H', 'Esmaeili SA', 'Allahyari A', 'Shirdel A', 'Rahimi H', 'Rezaee SA', 'Momtazi-Borojeni AA', 'Rafatpanah H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4376-1083'],"['Immunology Research Centre, Division of Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Centre, Division of Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Halal Research Center of IRI, FDA, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Centre, Division of Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201014,United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,"['0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, pX/*genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/virology', 'Healthy Volunteers/statistics & numerical data', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/classification/*genetics', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*genetics', 'Viral Load/*methods']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adult T-cell leukemia', '*Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1', '*Platelet-derived growth factor receptor', '*Tax']",2020/09/13 06:00,2021/10/09 06:00,['2020/09/12 08:34'],"['2020/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/12 08:34 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jmv.26510 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2021 Jun;93(6):3865-3870. doi: 10.1002/jmv.26510.

Hedgehog (HH) signaling is a major developmental pathway frequently deregulated in cancer, for which a role in T-ALL is emerging. Mounting evidence suggests that ligand-independent activation of HH pathway occurs in cancer including T-ALL, emphasizing the necessity of dissecting the complex interplay between HH and other signaling pathways regulating activation. In this work, we present a therapeutically relevant crosstalk between HH signaling and the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) pathway acting at the level of GLI1 transcription factor. GLI inhibitor GANT61 and dexamethasone were shown to exert a synergistic anti-leukemic effect in vitro in T-ALL cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, dexamethasone-activated NR3C1 impaired GLI1 function by dynamically modulating the recruitment of PCAF acetyltransferase and HDAC1 deacetylase. Increased GLI1 acetylation was associated with compromised transcriptional activity and reduced protein stability. In summary, our study identifies a novel crosstalk between GLI1 and NR3C1 signaling pathway which could be exploited in HH-dependent malignancies to increase therapeutic efficacy.","['Bongiovanni, Deborah', 'Tosello, Valeria', 'Saccomani, Valentina', 'Dalla Santa, Silvia', 'Amadori, Alberto', 'Zanovello, Paola', 'Piovan, Erich']","['Bongiovanni D', 'Tosello V', 'Saccomani V', 'Dalla Santa S', 'Amadori A', 'Zanovello P', 'Piovan E']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8693-4776', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4241-563X']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita di Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita di Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita di Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita di Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita di Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita di Padova, Padova, Italy. erich.piovan@unipd.it.', 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italy. erich.piovan@unipd.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200911,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (GANT 61)', '0 (GLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (NR3C1 protein, human)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP-associated factor)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Hedgehog Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Pyridines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/agonists/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,,,2020/09/13 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/09/12 05:32'],"['2020/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/12 05:32 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-020-01453-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-020-01453-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2020 Oct;39(42):6544-6555. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-01453-2.

We evaluated fluconazole prophylaxis and no antifungal prophylaxis, as a natural interrupted time-series study to assess survival and infection complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified patients with AML >/= 18 years old undergoing induction chemotherapy during 2 time periods: period 1, fluconazole prophylaxis from August 1, 2013 to September 30, 2015, and period 2, no prophylaxis from October 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. The primary outcome was incidence of proven or probable IFI. Secondary outcomes included types of IFIs and 60-day overall survival (OS). IFI was defined by the 2002 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group Consensus criteria. RESULTS: One hundred forty-four patients received induction chemotherapy over the 2 time periods. In the prophylaxis versus no-prophylaxis groups, the rate of proven or probable IFIs was 4 (5%) of 87 versus 12 (21%) of 57 (P = .01). The total number of proven IFIs was 3 (3%) of 87 versus 4 (7%) of 57 (P = .44), whereas probable IFIs were 1 (1%) of 87 versus 8 (14%) of 57 (P < .01). No difference was observed in fungemia. Incidence of IFIs was too low to detect resistance patterns. OS at 60 days was improved in with fluconazole prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis (hazard ratio, 0.329; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.89; P = .028). CONCLUSION: Observed rates of proven or probable IFI were lower in the fluconazole prophylaxis group versus the no-prophylaxis group. Sixty-day OS was higher with fluconazole prophylaxis. Further study is required to evaluate how fluconazole may impart the differences in survival seen in this analysis.","['Signorelli, Jessie', 'Lei, Matthew', 'Lam, Jenna', 'Jalbut, Marla', 'Amrein, Philip C', 'Fathi, Amir T', 'Hobbs, Gabriela', 'Hock, Hanno', 'McAfee, Steven Lawrence', 'Letourneau, Alyssa R', 'Narayan, Rupa', 'Brunner, Andrew']","['Signorelli J', 'Lei M', 'Lam J', 'Jalbut M', 'Amrein PC', 'Fathi AT', 'Hobbs G', 'Hock H', 'McAfee SL', 'Letourneau AR', 'Narayan R', 'Brunner A']",,"['Department of Pharmacy, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.

It is used in haematology to treat lymphoid B disorders. Haemorrhagic complications in dermatological surgery are occasionally associated with the use of anti-platelet and/or anticoagulant medication. Herein, we report a case of haemorrhage under ibrutinib following skin surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 70-year-old male patient began treatment with ibrutinib for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia had 2 basal cell carcinomas of the face. The next day he had a persistent haemorrhage lasting more than 48h, with no effects on the final scarring result. DISCUSSION: Ibrutinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor whose mechanism of action plays a role in platelet adhesion. It is known to cause haemorrhaging, either spontaneously or following invasive procedures, especially at the beginning of treatment. In the case of low-risk haemorrhagic procedures in which bleeding may be controlled by mechanical haemostasis, ibrutinib should be discontinued 3 days before and after surgery. In the event of recent initiation of ibrutinib and in the absence of urgent dermatological management, it is preferable to schedule any surgical procedures 3 months after the start of ibrutinib.","['Lebas, D', 'Preta, L-H', 'Leguern, A', 'Modiano, P', 'Wiart, T']","['Lebas D', 'Preta LH', 'Leguern A', 'Modiano P', 'Wiart T']",,"['Service de dermatologie, universite catholique de Lille, hopital Saint-Vincent de Paul, Lille, France.

The most frequent viral infections and graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) sometimes lead to thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality with the risk of death reaching 90%. Effective prevention and treatment are not available to date. Recent attempts at using antibody against C5 have been made. CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old girl with acute myeloid leukemia twice underwent alloHSCTs from her 10/10 HLA-matched sister. After the second HSCT severe acute steroid-resistant grade 4 GvHD occurred. Despite treatment with high doses of steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, biological therapy, and extracorporeal photopheresis, the patient developed TMA with acute kidney injury and the need for renal replacement therapy. The concentration of complement component 3 and activity of ADAMTS 13 were normal, and infection with Escherichia coli (E. coli) 0157H7 was excluded. Due to failure of all ordered therapies and severity of the condition, an attempt was taken to use eculizumab. Two 900-mg doses of eculizumab (Soliris) were administered at an interval of 2 weeks, which resulted in the improvement of renal function and amelioration of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. Dialysis therapy was finished after 5 weeks, and then a third dose of the drug was administered. Eighteen months later, the patient is alive and well, with limited chronic GvHD. eGFR remains stable at 40 to 46 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and mild hypertension requires treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and furosemide. CONCLUSION: Even a short course of eculizumab can be sufficient in controlling the TMA after HSCT, provided that the TMA-triggering factors are well controlled.","['Jarmolinski, Tomasz', 'Rosa, Monika', 'Puziewicz-Zmonarska, Anna', 'Kalwak, Krzysztof']","['Jarmolinski T', 'Rosa M', 'Puziewicz-Zmonarska A', 'Kalwak K']",,"['Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland; Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Neurology, District Hospital, Gorzow Wielkopolski, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation, Oncology and Hematology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.

We evaluated the safety of bronchoscopy and describe factors affecting its complication rate in such patients. METHODS: Between January 2009 and December 2018, 316 bronchoscopies in 282 patients with malignant hematologic disorders and pulmonary infiltrates were performed at our institution. The bronchoscopic procedure used and its complications were evaluated. RESULTS: The most common underlying disease was acute myeloid leukemia (134/282 patients, 47.5%). Platelet transfusion was performed the day before or the day of bronchoscopy in 42.4%, supplemental oxygen was administered before the procedure in 23.1%, and midazolam was used in 74.4%. Thirty-five bronchoscopies (11.1%) were complicated by hemoptysis and 7 patients developed pneumothorax, 4 of whom required thoracic drainage. Two patients (0.6%) were intubated within 48 h of the procedure and prolonged oxygen desaturation (> 48 h) occurred in 3.8%. Multivariate analysis showed that only use of midazolam significantly reduced the risk of prolonged oxygen desaturation (hazard ratio 0.28, 95% confidence interval 0.09-0.85, p = 0.03). Transbronchial lung biopsy significantly increased the risk of hemoptysis (hazard ratio 10.40, 95% confidence interval 4.18-25.90, p = 0.00), while use of midazolam significantly reduced the risk (hazard ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.14-0.73, p = 0.01).

Their overexpression has been associated with tumorigenesis and aggressiveness in cancers such as breast, prostate, non-small cell lung, and pediatric leukemia, making them a potential target for inhibitor development. Here, we report the discovery, development, and validation of a dual MKK4/7 inhibitor, BSJ-04-122, that covalently targets a conserved cysteine located before the DFG motif and displays excellent kinome selectivity. BSJ-04-122 exhibits potent cellular target engagement and induces robust target-specific downstream effects. The combination of the dual MKK4/7 inhibitor with a selective, covalent JNK inhibitor demonstrated an enhanced antiproliferative activity against triple-negative breast cancer cells. Taken together, the results show that BSJ-04-122 represents a pharmacological probe for MKK4/7 and credential covalent targeting as a way to explore the therapeutic potential of these kinases.","['Jiang, Jie', 'Jiang, Baishan', 'He, Zhixiang', 'Ficarro, Scott B', 'Che, Jianwei', 'Marto, Jarrod A', 'Gao, Yang', 'Zhang, Tinghu', 'Gray, Nathanael S']","['Jiang J', 'Jiang B', 'He Z', 'Ficarro SB', 'Che J', 'Marto JA', 'Gao Y', 'Zhang T', 'Gray NS']",,"['Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', ""Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Blais Proteomics Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA."", 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', ""Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Blais Proteomics Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA; Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Oncologic Pathology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA."", 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.

L-Asparaginase (ASNase) has contributed to a significant improvement in acute lymphoblastic leukemia outcomes; however, toxicity and resistance limit its clinical use in other tumors. Here, we report that, in multiple myeloma (MM) cells, the DNA methylation status is significantly associated with reduced expression of ASNase-related gene signatures, thus suggesting ASNase sensitivity for this tumor. Therefore, we tested the effects of ASNase purified from Erwinia chrysanthemi (Erw-ASNase), combined with the next-generation proteasome inhibitor (PI) carfilzomib. We observed an impressive synergistic effect on MM cells, whereas normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells were not affected. Importantly, this effect was associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, compounded mitochondrial damage, and Nrf2 upregulation, regardless of the c-Myc oncogenic-specific program. Furthermore, the cotreatment resulted in genomic instability and DNA repair mechanism impairment via increased mitochondrial oxidative stress, which further enhanced its antitumor activity. Interestingly, carfilzomib-resistant cells were found to be highly dependent on amino acid starvation, as reflected by their higher sensitivity to Erw-ASNase treatment compared with isogenic cells. Overall, by affecting several cellular programs, Erw-ASNase makes MM cells more vulnerable to carfilzomib, providing proof of concept for clinical use of this combination as a novel strategy to enhance PI sensitivity in MM patients.","['Soncini, Debora', 'Minetto, Paola', 'Martinuzzi, Claudia', 'Becherini, Pamela', 'Fenu, Valeria', 'Guolo, Fabio', 'Todoerti, Katia', 'Calice, Giovanni', 'Contini, Paola', 'Miglino, Maurizio', 'Rivoli, Giulia', 'Aquino, Sara', 'Dominietto, Alida', 'Cagnetta, Antonia', 'Passalacqua, Mario', 'Bruzzone, Santina', 'Nencioni, Alessio', 'Zucchetti, Massimo', 'Ceruti, Tommaso', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Lemoli, Roberto M', 'Cea, Michele']","['Soncini D', 'Minetto P', 'Martinuzzi C', 'Becherini P', 'Fenu V', 'Guolo F', 'Todoerti K', 'Calice G', 'Contini P', 'Miglino M', 'Rivoli G', 'Aquino S', 'Dominietto A', 'Cagnetta A', 'Passalacqua M', 'Bruzzone S', 'Nencioni A', 'Zucchetti M', 'Ceruti T', 'Neri A', 'Lemoli RM', 'Cea M']",,"['Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Clinical Cancer Pharmacology Unit, Department of Oncology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, Milan, Italy; and.', 'Clinical Cancer Pharmacology Unit, Department of Oncology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, Milan, Italy; and.', 'Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '72X6E3J5AR (carfilzomib)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['*Amino Acids', '*Asparaginase/pharmacology', 'Cell Death', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Mitochondria', 'Oligopeptides', 'Reactive Oxygen Species']",PMC7509874,,,2020/09/12 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/11 17:13'],"['2020/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/11 17:13 [entrez]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31512-3 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001639 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Sep 22;4(18):4312-4326. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001639.,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on preclinical data of Bruton tyrosine kinase expression/phosphorylation and ibrutinib cytotoxicity in AML blasts, we conducted a randomized phase 2 multicenter study to assess the tolerability and efficacy of the addition of ibrutinib to 10-day decitabine in unfit (ie, Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index >/=3) AML patients and higher risk myelodysplasia patients (HOVON135/SAKK30/15 trial). In total, 144 eligible patients were randomly (1:1) assigned to either 10-day decitabine combined with ibrutinib (560 mg; sequentially given, starting the day after the last dose of decitabine) (n = 72) or to 10-day decitabine (n = 72). The addition of ibrutinib was well tolerated, and the number of adverse events was comparable for both arms. In the decitabine plus ibrutinib arm, 41% reached complete remission/complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi), the median overall survival (OS) was 11 months, and 2-year OS was 27%; these findings compared with 50% CR/CRi, median OS of 11.5 months, and 2-year OS of 21% for the decitabine group (not significant). Extensive molecular profiling at diagnosis revealed that patients with STAG2, IDH2, and ASXL1 mutations had significantly lower CR/CRi rates, whereas patients with mutations in TP53 had significantly higher CR/CRi rates. Furthermore, multicolor flow cytometry revealed that after 3 cycles of treatment, 28 (49%) of 57 patients with available bone marrow samples had no measurable residual disease. In this limited number of cases, measurable residual disease revealed no apparent impact on event-free survival and OS.

The goal of this study is to assess how to optimize this procedure. Methods and Patients: One hundred thirty-three patients between 12 and 20 years old, who underwent SCP between 1980 and 2017, were included. Baseline data (age, indication for SCP, and semen parameters at freezing) and follow-up data (outcome of sperm straws and follow-up of sperm quality) were collected and analyzed. Results: SCP is feasible from the age of 12. Semen assessment parameters at this age were close to parameters of adults. However, we observed quantitative impairments in testicular tumors and qualitative impairments in leukemia and bone marrow failure. Four patients (3%) used their cryopreserved semen for medically assisted reproduction, 15 patients died (11.3%), 18 asked for destruction of their straws (13.5%), and nine samples were destroyed because of lack of news (6.8%). Very few patients underwent a sperm analysis after treatment. Conclusions: SCP is an efficient, still underused, procedure for adolescents and young adults. Cryopreserved sperm is rarely used and rarely destroyed, but studies with a longer follow-up are needed to better assess these observations. Follow-up with a specialist of reproductive medicine is valuable for better information of the patient.","['Adam, Cecile', 'Deffert, Christine', 'Leyvraz, Celine', 'Primi, Marie-Pierre', 'Simon, Jean-Pascale', 'Beck Popovic, Maja', 'Benard, Julie', 'Bouthors, Therese', 'Girardin, Celine', 'Streuli, Isabelle', 'Vulliemoz, Nicolas', 'Gumy-Pause, Fabienne']","['Adam C', 'Deffert C', 'Leyvraz C', 'Primi MP', 'Simon JP', 'Beck Popovic M', 'Benard J', 'Bouthors T', 'Girardin C', 'Streuli I', 'Vulliemoz N', 'Gumy-Pause F']",,"['Division of Pediatrics, Oncology and Hematology Unit, Woman-Mother-Child Department, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Diagnostics Department, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Andrology and Reproductive Biology Laboratory, Division of Gynecology, Woman-Mother-Child Department, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Andrology and Reproductive Biology Laboratory, Division of Gynecology, Woman-Mother-Child Department, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'General Management of the University Hospital, Legal Affairs, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Division of Pediatrics, Oncology and Hematology Unit, Woman-Mother-Child Department, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Unit for Reproductive Medicine and Gynecological Endocrinology, Department of Woman, Child and Adolescent, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Division of Pediatrics, Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology Unit, Woman-Mother-Child Department, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Endocrine and Diabetes Unit, Department of Woman, Child and Adolescent, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Unit for Reproductive Medicine and Gynecological Endocrinology, Department of Woman, Child and Adolescent, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Fertility Medicine and Gynecological Endocrinology Unit, Woman-Mother-Child Department, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Pediatric Onco-Hematology Unit, Department of Woman, Child and Adolescent, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200911,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cryopreservation', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Neoplasms/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Semen Analysis', '*Semen Preservation', 'Spermatozoa', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*adolescents', '*cancer', '*fertility preservation', '*sperm cryopreservation', '*spermiogram']",2020/09/12 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2020/09/11 17:11'],"['2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/11 17:11 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2020.0121 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2021 Feb;10(1):78-84. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2020.0121.

However, the association between maternal diabetes and risk of childhood cancer in the offspring has so far not been well studied. We thus conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the role of maternal diabetes on the risk of childhood cancer. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search to identify eligible studies published up to June 20, 2020, including the PubMed, Web of science and Embase databases. Summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using a random-effects model (I(2) >/= 25%) or a fixed-effect model (I(2) < 25%). RESULTS: Totally, sixteen case-control and six cohort studies on the risk of childhood cancer associated with maternal diabetes were included. Overall, children of diabetic women had a significantly increased risk in childhood malignancy (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.10-1.53). Notably, a significantly elevated risk of childhood cancer in the offspring was found for women with pre-existing diabetes (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.17-1.70), but not for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.94-1.28). For site-specific cancers, maternal diabetes was associated with a higher risk of leukemia in offspring (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.15-1.48), especially for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.27-1.64). However, no significant associations were observed between maternal diabetes and the risk of lymphomas and retinoblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis indicates that maternal diabetes is associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer in the offspring, particularly for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Future study should investigate the underlying biological mechanisms behind the association.","['Yan, Pengfei', 'Wang, Yongbo', 'Yu, Xue', 'Liu, Yu', 'Zhang, Zhi-Jiang']","['Yan P', 'Wang Y', 'Yu X', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang ZJ']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0119-7234'],"['Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'Center for Evidence-Based and Translational Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'Department of Statistics and Management, School of Management, Wuhan Institute of Technology, Wuhan, 430205, China.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Health Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China. zhang22968@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20200911,Germany,Acta Diabetol,Acta diabetologica,9200299,,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child of Impaired Parents/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', '*Diabetes, Gestational', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Observational Studies as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood cancers', 'Childhood leukemia', 'Gestational diabetes mellitus', 'Maternal diabetes']",2020/09/12 06:00,2021/03/16 06:00,['2020/09/11 12:13'],"['2020/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/11 12:13 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00592-020-01598-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00592-020-01598-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Diabetol. 2021 Feb;58(2):153-168. doi: 10.1007/s00592-020-01598-2.

In the current study, we have focused on exploring the efficacy of a simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of BCR-ABL1 and IRE1alpha in Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) ALL using tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) nilotinib and the IRE1alpha inhibitor MKC-8866. The combination of 0.5 microM nilotinib and 30 microM MKC-8866 in Ph+ ALL cell lines led to a synergistic effect on cell viability. To mimic this dual inhibition on a genetic level, pre-B-cells from conditional Xbp1+/fl mice were transduced with a BCR-ABL1 construct and with either tamoxifen-inducible cre or empty vector. Cells showed a significant sensitization to the effect of TKIs after the induction of the heterozygous deletion. Finally, we performed a phosphoproteomic analysis on Ph+ ALL cell lines treated with the combination of nilotinib and MKC-8866 to identify potential targets involved in their synergistic effect. An enhanced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase alpha (p38alpha MAPK) was identified. In line with this findings, p38 MAPK and, another important endoplasmic reticulum-stress-related kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were found to mediate the potentiated cytotoxic effect induced by the combination of MKC-8866 and nilotinib since the targeting of p38 MAPK with its specific inhibitor BIRB-796 or JNK with JNK-in-8 hindered the synergistic effect observed upon treatment with nilotinib and MKC-8866. In conclusion, the identified combined action of nilotinib and MKC-8866 might represent a successful therapeutic strategy in high-risk Ph+ ALL.","['Vieri, Margherita', 'Preisinger, Christian', 'Schemionek, Mirle', 'Salimi, Azam', 'Patterson, John B', 'Samali, Afshin', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Appelmann, Iris', 'Kharabi Masouleh, Behzad']","['Vieri M', 'Preisinger C', 'Schemionek M', 'Salimi A', 'Patterson JB', 'Samali A', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Appelmann I', 'Kharabi Masouleh B']",,"['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Aachen, Germany.', 'Proteomics Facility, Interdisciplinary Centre for Clinical Research, RWTH Aachen University Medical School, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Aachen, Germany.', 'Fosun Orinove PharmaTech Inc., Newbury Park, CA, USA.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, Galway, Ireland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (JNK-IN-8)', '0 (MKC8866)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (X-Box Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Xbp1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ERN1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'HO1A8B3YVV (doramapimod)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Benzopyrans/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endoribonucleases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/genetics', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Morpholines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Synthetic Lethal Mutations/*drug effects', 'X-Box Binding Protein 1/genetics', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,,2020/09/12 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2020/09/11 12:12'],"['2019/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/11 12:12 [entrez]']","['5904190 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgaa095 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2021 Feb 25;42(2):272-284. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgaa095.,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

The clonal relationship between the 2 histologic subtypes was investigated. METHODS: A diagnosis of FL grade 1/2 (low grade) was made by bone marrow (BM) biopsy. B-LBL was identified in biopsies from the testis and pancreas. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses were performed to investigate their clonal relationship. RESULTS: Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses and G-banding karyotype analyses identified the BCL2-IGH and MYC-IGH translocation in tumor cells from both the BM and testis. The tumor cells from the BM and testis shared the same IGH VDJ usage and a high degree of somatic mutations. These findings suggest that acquisition of MYC gene rearrangement is a critical event for lymphoblastic transformation of FL. Of note, the presence of intraclonal diversity in the B-LBL sample further suggests an earlier or concurrent event of MYC translocation than the somatic IGH mutation in the germinal center and the dedifferentiation of lymphoma cells to a precursor stage of B-cell development. CONCLUSIONS: B-lymphoblastic transformation of FL can occur with MYC gene rearrangement.","['Fujimoto, Ayumi', 'Ikejiri, Fumiyoshi', 'Arakawa, Fumiko', 'Ito, Shunsuke', 'Okada, Yusuke', 'Takahashi, Fumimasa', 'Matsuda, Shinichiro', 'Okada, Takahiro', 'Inoue, Masaya', 'Takahashi, Tsutomu', 'Miyake, Takaaki', 'Maruyama, Riruke', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Suzuki, Ritsuro']","['Fujimoto A', 'Ikejiri F', 'Arakawa F', 'Ito S', 'Okada Y', 'Takahashi F', 'Matsuda S', 'Okada T', 'Inoue M', 'Takahashi T', 'Miyake T', 'Maruyama R', 'Ohshima K', 'Suzumiya J', 'Suzuki R']",,"['Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (BCL2-IgH fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Lymphoma, Follicular/complications/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Pancreas/pathology', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'Testis/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['* MYC rearrangement', '*B-lymphoblastic lymphoma', '*Follicular lymphoma', '*Transformation']",2020/09/12 06:00,2021/03/27 06:00,['2020/09/11 12:12'],"['2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/11 12:12 [entrez]']","['5904192 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqaa126 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2021 Feb 4;155(2):308-317. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqaa126.,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

AS within acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not yet been systematically analyzed yet. This study analyzed the transcriptomic profiling and corresponding clinical data from AML cases based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In addition, the prediction model, along with the splicing network, was used to analyze the prognosis for AML patients according to the seven different AS event types. Among the 34,984 AS events across the 8830 genes, 2896 AS events were detected among 1905 genes, showing marked correlation with the overall survival of patients. The risk scoring model based on all AS event types was the most efficient in identifying the prognosis for AML patients. Meanwhile, the area under the curve at 1-, 3-, 5-year were 0.852, 0.935, 0.955, respectively. At the same time, the splicing regulating network, which was constituted by 21 splicing factor genes as well as 32 AS events related to survival, was characterized. In conclusion, our predictive model constructed based on the AS events accurately predicts the survival for AML patients. In addition, the network between AS events and splicing factor is established, which may serve as a potential mechanism.","['Chen, Si-Liang', 'Dai, Yu-Jun', 'Hu, Fang', 'Wang, Yun', 'Li, Huan', 'Liang, Yang']","['Chen SL', 'Dai YJ', 'Hu F', 'Wang Y', 'Li H', 'Liang Y']",,"['Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200911,United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Survival Analysis', 'Transcriptome/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['TCGA', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'alternative splicing', 'prognostic predictor', 'risk scoring model', 'splicing correlation network']",2020/09/12 06:00,2020/11/24 06:00,['2020/09/11 12:12'],"['2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/11 12:12 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.2020.5392 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2020 Nov;39(11):2040-2051. doi: 10.1089/dna.2020.5392.

Despite efforts to improve overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS), the prognosis of pancreatic cancer remains poor, underscoring the importance of identifying new biomarkers to predict metastasis in patients with pancreatic cancer. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is overexpressed in many types of cancer and is involved in the development of various malignancies including pancreatic cancer. However, the role of LIF as a biomarker to predict metastasis in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In this study, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses identified LIF expression in pancreatic tumor tissues as an independent risk factor related to worse OS and RFS. LIF overexpression was related to poor clinicopathological features such as lymph node metastasis and Pathological stage (pTNM) stage. Serum LIF levels were higher in pancreatic cancer patients than in healthy controls. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that serum LIF is more effective than other biomarkers (CA199 and CEA) for predicting lymph node and distant metastasis.","['Jiang, Wenna', 'Bai, Weiwei', 'Li, Jianhua', 'Liu, Jing', 'Zhao, Kaili', 'Ren, Li']","['Jiang W', 'Bai W', 'Li J', 'Liu J', 'Zhao K', 'Ren L']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1530-8457'],"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pancreatic Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Breast Oncoplastic Surgery, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pancreatic Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201005,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (carbohydrate antigen 199, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen/blood', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/blood/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*biomarkers', '*diagnosis', '*metastasis', '*pancreatic cancer', '*prediction']",2020/09/12 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2020/09/11 08:39'],"['2019/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/11 08:39 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.33291 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2021 Feb 15;148(4):1006-1013. doi: 10.1002/ijc.33291.

Our goal was to describe the self-reported levels of psychological distress, subjective illness experience and needs of young Slovenian cancer patients and survivors. METHODS: Seventy-nine participants, aged 19-39 years, answered questionnaires about anxiety, depression, mental defeat, cancer worry and their experience of learning the diagnosis and being treated. We used visualisations to demonstrate the relationship between anxiety and depression. The qualitative responses were summarised using a content analysis approach. RESULTS: Twenty-eight (35%) participants scored in the clinical range for anxiety and fifteen (19%) for depression. Cancer-related worry was common (85% reported at least one worry). Mental defeat was positively associated with measures of psychological distress. Those who felt negative about learning their diagnosis emphasised the need for more time, empathy and dignity. Psychological support during illness was seen as crucial. CONCLUSION: Anxiety and depression remain a problem for a subset of patients. Medical professionals working with young people with cancer should encourage a warm atmosphere as they attend to patients' needs and concerns.","['Kosir, Urska', 'Roskar, Sanja', 'Wild, Jennifer', 'Bowes, Lucy']","['Kosir U', 'Roskar S', 'Wild J', 'Bowes L']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2132-4090'],"['Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Hearing and Speech Centre Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia.', 'Europa Donna Slovenija, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Slovenian Lymphoma and Leukemia Patient Association, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200910,England,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),European journal of cancer care,9301979,,,"['Adolescent', '*Anxiety/epidemiology', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Depression/epidemiology', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms', 'Stress, Psychological/epidemiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['adolescent cancer', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'needs', 'psychosocial', 'young adult cancer']",2020/09/12 06:00,2021/09/30 06:00,['2020/09/11 05:50'],"['2020/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/11 05:50 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ecc.13326 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2020 Nov;29(6):e13326. doi: 10.1111/ecc.13326.

THP-1 is a human monocytic cell line that is derived from patients with acute monocytic leukemia. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of malvidin on inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells were stimulated with LPS (50 ng/ml) to induce inflammation in the presence or absence of malvidin. The anti/proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Total protein levels/phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), P65-NF-kappaB, and IKKalpha/IKKbeta were evaluated by western blot analysis. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) metabolite levels, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), total thiol (T-SH) content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity were measured to evaluate the antioxidant activity of malvidin in THP-1 cells. Treatment of LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells with malvidin (100 and 200 muM) led to the significant inhibition of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-1beta messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and protein levels as well as a significant increase in the IL-10 mRNA expression and protein secretion. Moreover, 200 muM malvidin treatment reduced the phosphorylation of JNK, IKKalpha/IKKbeta, and P65-NF-kappaB. These findings showed that malvidin not only decreased the MDA and NO metabolite levels but also increased the FRAP and T-SH content as well as SOD and GPx activities. The findings of the present study demonstrated the potential role of malvidin in blocking inflammation and oxidative stress induced by LPS in THP-1 cell line, suggesting that malvidin is likely to be a therapeutic agent for inflammatory diseases.","['Bastin, Alireza', 'Sadeghi, Asie', 'Nematollahi, Mohammad Hadi', 'Abolhassani, Moslem', 'Mohammadi, Abbas', 'Akbari, Hamed']","['Bastin A', 'Sadeghi A', 'Nematollahi MH', 'Abolhassani M', 'Mohammadi A', 'Akbari H']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5241-9856', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9529-4077']","['Herbal and Traditional Medicine Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences and Cosmetic Products Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Physiology Research Center, Institute of Basic and Clinical Physiology Sciences, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center, Institute of Basic and Clinical Physiology Sciences, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200910,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Anthocyanins)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '10463-84-0 (malvidin)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Anthocyanins/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/immunology/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Inflammation Mediators/*metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/toxicity', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*THP-1 cells', '*cytokines', '*inflammation', '*malvidin', '*oxidative stress']",2020/09/12 06:00,2021/09/21 06:00,['2020/09/11 05:48'],"['2020/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/11 05:48 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.30049 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2021 Apr;236(4):2790-2799. doi: 10.1002/jcp.30049.

We previously reported that steroid-structured cucurbitacin D (CuD) induces apoptosis in ATL cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling inhibitors on CuD-induced cell death in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) isolated from ATL/acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and two human leukemia cell lines (MT-1 and MT-4). PBLs were isolated from an ATL/ALL patient as well as from a healthy donor. Cell surface markers were examined using flow cytometry. Serum cytokine levels were estimated using LEGENDplex or analyzed at the Center for Clinical and Translational Research of Kyushu University Hospital. Cell proliferation was assessed using the Cell Titer-Glo luminescent cell viability assay. Protein expression was determined by western blotting. PBLs from patients highly expressed CD4 and CD5. Serum from the patient contained high levels of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, IL-18, and interferon-gamma compared to the healthy donor. CuD-induced cell death was enhanced by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)1/2 inhibitor U0126. However, a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor prevented CuD-induced cell death. Immunoblot analyses revealed that CuD reduced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and JNK, and co-treatment with CuD and U0126 did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK. MEK1/2 and p38 inhibitors enhanced CuD-induced cell death, and U0126 enhanced the CuD-induced de-phosphorylation of ERK in MT-1 and MT-4 cells. We conclude that CuD reduces ERK activation, resulting in enhanced antitumor effects on leukemic cells.","['Wang, Duo', 'Shen, Mengyue', 'Kitamura, Noriaki', 'Sennari, Yusuke', 'Morita, Kentaro', 'Tsukada, Junichi', 'Kanazawa, Tamotsu', 'Yoshida, Yasuhiro']","['Wang D', 'Shen M', 'Kitamura N', 'Sennari Y', 'Morita K', 'Tsukada J', 'Kanazawa T', 'Yoshida Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1658-3119'],"['Department of Immunology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu, 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu, 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu, 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu, 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu, 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu, 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu, 807-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Yahatanishi-ku, Kitakyushu, 807-8555, Japan. freude@med.uoeh-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200910,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATL/ALL', '*Cucurbitacin D', '*MEK']",2020/09/12 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2020/09/11 05:47'],"['2020/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/11 05:47 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10637-020-00997-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s10637-020-00997-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2021 Feb;39(1):122-130. doi: 10.1007/s10637-020-00997-0.

Several approaches had been tried to determine the time of death, including physical and chemical changes. This study aims to explore the postmortem changes in the expression of apoptosis-related genes in the liver of mice and to use these changes for estimation of the PMI. METHODS: Hepatic tissue was collected from sacrificed mice immediately after death (the control group) and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 hours after death. Four apoptosisrelated genes were selected as target genes, which are Caspase 3 (Casp3), B cell leukemia/ lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), BCL2-associated X protein (Bax), and Transformation related protein 53 (Trp53), and their relative expression was measured using quantitative PCR. miR-122 was used as a reference gene for normalization of the Ct (threshold cycle) values of the target genes. RESULTS: The results revealed that the postmortem expression of Casp3 increased in a time-dependent manner; the expression of Bax increased from 3 to 18 hours followed by a decrease at 24 hours after death; the expression of Bcl2 decreased in a time-dependent manner after death; the expression of Trp53 increased from 3 to 6 hours and then started to decrease from 9 to 24 hours after death. CONCLUSION: Based on the observed changes in the expression level of these genes, mathematical models were established to estimate the PMI. Further research is needed to investigate these markers and mathematical models in human tissues.","['Noshy, Peter A']",['Noshy PA'],['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1619-6189'],"['Department of Toxicology and Forensic Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt. peter_medicine@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200910,Germany,Int J Legal Med,International journal of legal medicine,9101456,"['0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn122 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Trp53 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Caspase 3/*genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'MicroRNAs', 'Models, Theoretical', '*Postmortem Changes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Bax', 'Bcl2', 'Caspase 3', 'Postmortem interval', 'Time of death', 'Trp53', 'qPCR']",2020/09/12 06:00,2021/09/10 06:00,['2020/09/11 05:46'],"['2020/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/11 05:46 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00414-020-02419-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00414-020-02419-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Legal Med. 2021 Mar;135(2):539-545. doi: 10.1007/s00414-020-02419-5.

In light of our recent report showing prognostic significance of CD33 splicing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate CD33 SNPs for accurate prediction of patients with AML who are more or less likely to respond to GO. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the five new CD33 SNPs (rs2455069, rs35112940, rs61736475, rs1803254, and rs201074739) for association with CD33 leukemic cell surface expression and clinical response in pediatric patients with AML enrolled in the Children's Oncology Group AAML0531 trial. We further developed a composite CD33 pharmacogenetics (PGx) score using six CD33 SNPs (CD33_PGx6_score) for association with clinical outcome. RESULTS: Four CD33 SNPs were associated with cell surface CD33 levels and clinical response in the GO versus no-GO arms. Therefore, the CD33_PGx6_score was built using directional genotype scores for the previously reported splicing SNP and five new SNPs. Patients with a CD33_PGx6_score of 0 or higher had higher CD33 expression levels compared with patients with a score of less than 0 (P < .001). In addition, patients with a score of 0 or higher demonstrated an improved disease-free survival in the GO versus no-GO arms (62.5% +/- 7.8% v 46.8% +/- 8.3%, respectively; P = .008) and a reduced risk of relapse (28.3% +/- 7.2% v 49.9% +/- 8.4%, respectively; P < .001). No improvement from GO was observed in patients with a CD33-PGx6_score of less than 0. Consistent results were observed across the risk groups. CONCLUSION: In this study, we report a composite CD33_PGx6_score using directional genotype scores of CD33 SNPs. Once validated, our findings hold promise for use of the CD33_PGx6_score to guide efficient use of GO in patients with AML. In addition, because the CD33_PGx6_score considers SNPs with varying abundance in different ethnic groups, it has potential for global application.","['Chauhan, Lata', 'Shin, Miyoung', 'Wang, Yi-Cheng', 'Loken, Michael', 'Pollard, Jessica', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Hirsch, Betsy A', 'Raimondi, Susana', 'Ries, Rhonda E', 'Bernstein, Irwin D', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Lamba, Jatinder K']","['Chauhan L', 'Shin M', 'Wang YC', 'Loken M', 'Pollard J', 'Aplenc R', 'Hirsch BA', 'Raimondi S', 'Ries RE', 'Bernstein ID', 'Gamis AS', 'Alonzo TA', 'Meshinchi S', 'Lamba JK']",,"['University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA."", 'Hematologics, Seattle, WA.', 'Maine Medical Center, Portland, ME.', 'Tufts University, Boston, MA.', ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', ""Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, MO."", 'University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190523,United States,JCO Precis Oncol,JCO precision oncology,101705370,,,,PMC7446480,,,2019/05/23 00:00,2019/05/23 00:01,['2020/09/11 05:46'],"['2019/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/11 05:46 [entrez]', '2019/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/23 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1200/PO.18.00387 [doi]', '1800387 [pii]']",epublish,JCO Precis Oncol. 2019 May 23;3. pii: 1800387. doi: 10.1200/PO.18.00387. eCollection 2019.,['(c) 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['The following represents disclosure information provided by authors of this', 'manuscript.

Polymethine dye-functionalized nanoparticles can be internalized by specific cell types using transmembrane carrier proteins. In this study we investigated the uptake behavior of various polymethine dyes on leukemia cell lines and searched for carrier proteins that guide dye transport using RNA interference. The results show that the uptake of DY-635 is dependent on organic anion transport protein 1B3 (OATP1B3) in CML cells and immature myeloid precursor cells of CML patients. In contrast to nonspecific poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle constructs, DY-635-functionalization of nanoparticles led to an uptake in CML cells. Investigation of these nanoparticles on bone marrow of CML patients showed a preferred uptake in LSC. The transcription of OATP1B3 is known to be induced under hypoxic conditions via the hypoxia-inducing factor 1 alpha (HIF1alpha), thus also in the stem cells niche. Since these cells have the potential to repopulate the bone marrow after CML treatment discontinuation, eliminating them by means of drug-loaded DY-635-functionalized PLGA nanoparticles deployed as a selective delivery system to LSC is highly relevant to the ongoing search for curative treatment options for CML patients.","['Ernst, Philipp', 'Press, Adrian T', 'Fischer, Mike', 'Gunther, Vivien', 'Grafe, Christine', 'Clement, Joachim H', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Schubert, Ulrich S', 'Wotschadlo, Jana', 'Lehmann, Marc', 'Enzensperger, Christoph', 'Bauer, Michael', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Ernst P', 'Press AT', 'Fischer M', 'Gunther V', 'Grafe C', 'Clement JH', 'Ernst T', 'Schubert US', 'Wotschadlo J', 'Lehmann M', 'Enzensperger C', 'Bauer M', 'Hochhaus A']",,"['Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Else-Kroner-Forschungskolleg, Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Anasthesiologie und Intensivmedizin, Center for Sepsis Control and Care (CSCC), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Jena Center for Soft Matter (JCSM), Friedrich Schiller Universitat Jena, Philosophenweg 7, 07743 Jena, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry (IOMC), Friedrich Schiller Universitat Jena, Humboldtstrasse 10, 07743 Jena, Germany.', 'SmartDyeLivery GmbH, Botzstrasse 5, 07743 Jena, Germany.', 'SmartDyeLivery GmbH, Botzstrasse 5, 07743 Jena, Germany.', 'SmartDyeLivery GmbH, Botzstrasse 5, 07743 Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Anasthesiologie und Intensivmedizin, Center for Sepsis Control and Care (CSCC), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Jena Center for Soft Matter (JCSM), Friedrich Schiller Universitat Jena, Philosophenweg 7, 07743 Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200725,United States,Mol Ther Oncolytics,Molecular therapy oncolytics,101666776,,,,PMC7452122,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'OATP1B3', 'OCT1', 'nanoparticles', 'polymethine dyes']",2020/09/12 06:00,2020/09/12 06:01,['2020/09/11 05:45'],"['2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/11 05:45 [entrez]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.omto.2020.07.007 [doi]', 'S2372-7705(20)30111-X [pii]']",epublish,Mol Ther Oncolytics. 2020 Jul 25;18:372-381. doi: 10.1016/j.omto.2020.07.007. eCollection 2020 Sep 25.,['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marked basophilia can be seen in CML and other neoplastic and reactive processes. Tryptase is a serine protease that is mainly expressed in mast cells, whereas basophils express only trace amounts of the enzyme. Therefore, it has always been regarded as a specific marker for mast cells. We report a case of a 41-year-old male who had been diagnosed with CML eight years ago, and, interestingly, his most recent bone marrow biopsy demonstrated an accelerated phase of the disease with a significant increase of basophils count. These basophils were immunoreactive with tryptase along with CD123. In the literature, this phenomenon of tryptase immunoreactivity by basophils has been described in association with CML, primary myelofibrosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Therefore, our finding supports these data and suggests that tryptase should not be regarded as a specific marker for mast cells when approaching various myeloid neoplasms including CML.","['Khafateh, Youssef', 'Aqil, Barina']","['Khafateh Y', 'Aqil B']",,"['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, USA.', 'Pathology, University of Louisville/Northwestern University, Louisville, USA.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Louisville, Louisville, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200805,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,PMC7474567,['NOTNLM'],"['basophilia', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'tryptase']",2020/09/12 06:00,2020/09/12 06:01,['2020/09/11 05:44'],"['2020/09/11 05:44 [entrez]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.9577 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 Aug 5;12(8):e9577. doi: 10.7759/cureus.9577.,"['Copyright (c) 2020, Khafateh et al.']",,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, abundant data prove the occurrence of radiogenic adaptive protection specifically at doses below approximately 200 mGy (with some data suggesting such protection at a dose even higher than 200 mGy). Moreover, cells do not thrive properly when deprived of radiation below background dose. Two threshold doses need be considered in constructing a valid dose-response relationship. With doses beginning to rise from zero, cells increasingly escape radiation deprivation. The dose at which radiation-deprived cells begin to function homeostatically provides dose Threshold A. With further dose increase, adaptive protection becomes prominent and then largely disappears at acute doses above approximately 200 mGy. The dose at which damage begins to override protection defines Threshold B. Thresholds A and B should be terms in modeling dose-response functions. Regarding whole-body responses, current data suggest for low-LET acute, non-chronic, irradiation a Threshold B of about 100 mGy prevails, except for leukemia and probably some other malignancies, and for chronic, low dose-rate irradiation where the Threshold B may well reach 1 Gy per year. A new Research and Development Program should determine individual Thresholds A and B for various radiogenic cell responses depending on radiation quality and target.","['Waltar, Alan', 'Feinendegen, Ludwig']","['Waltar A', 'Feinendegen L']",,"['Retired Professor and Head, Department of Nuclear Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX.', 'Nuclear Medicine, Heinrich-Heine University, Lindau, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200820,United States,Dose Response,Dose-response : a publication of International Hormesis Society,101308899,,,,PMC7444125,['NOTNLM'],"['LNT', 'low-dose radiation', 'low-dose responses', 'low-dose thresholds']",2020/09/12 06:00,2020/09/12 06:01,['2020/09/11 05:43'],"['2020/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/11 05:43 [entrez]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1559325820949729 [doi]', '10.1177_1559325820949729 [pii]']",epublish,Dose Response. 2020 Aug 20;18(3):1559325820949729. doi: 10.1177/1559325820949729. eCollection 2020 Jul-Sep.,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,"['Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying anticancer mechanisms of 20(S)-GRh2 targeting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in T-ALL have not been explored. Methods: Cell growth and cell cycle were determined to investigate the effect of 20(S)-GRh2 on ALL cells. PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway-related proteins were detected in 20(S)-GRh2-treated Jurkat cells by immunoblotting. Antitumor effect of 20(S)-GRh2 against T-ALL was investigated in xenograft mice. The mechanisms of 20(S)-GRh2 against T-ALL were examined by cell proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy. Results: In the present study, the results showed that 20(S)-GRh2 decreased cell growth and arrested cell cycle at the G1 phase in ALL cells. 20(S)-GRh2 induced apoptosis through enhancing reactive oxygen species generation and upregulating apoptosis-related proteins. 20(S)-GRh2 significantly elevated the levels of pEGFP-LC3 and autophagy-related proteins in Jurkat cells. Furthermore, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was effectively blocked by 20(S)-GRh2. 20(S)-GRh2 suppressed cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis and autophagy by suppressing the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in Jurkat cells. Finally, 20(S)-GRh2 alleviated symptoms of leukemia and reduced the number of white blood cells and CD3 staining in the spleen of xenograft mice, indicating antitumor effects against T-ALL in vivo. Conclusion: These findings indicate that 20(S)-GRh2 exhibits beneficial effects against T-ALL through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and could be a natural product of novel target for T-ALL therapy.","['Xia, Ting', 'Zhang, Jin', 'Zhou, Chuanxin', 'Li, Yu', 'Duan, Wenhui', 'Zhang, Bo', 'Wang, Min', 'Fang, Jianpei']","['Xia T', 'Zhang J', 'Zhou C', 'Li Y', 'Duan W', 'Zhang B', 'Wang M', 'Fang J']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science & Technology, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science & Technology, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Fifth Hospital of Sun Yat Sen University, Sun Yat sen University, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science & Technology, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science & Technology, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science & Technology, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science & Technology, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guang Dong, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Gene Regulation and Target Therapy of Guangdong Higher Education Institutes, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guang Dong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190730,Korea (South),J Ginseng Res,Journal of ginseng research,100890690,,,,PMC7471214,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Ginsenoside Rh2', 'PI3K/Akt/mTOR', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2020/09/12 06:00,2020/09/12 06:01,['2020/09/11 05:43'],"['2019/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/11 05:43 [entrez]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jgr.2019.07.003 [doi]', 'S1226-8453(19)30113-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Ginseng Res. 2020 Sep;44(5):725-737. doi: 10.1016/j.jgr.2019.07.003.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning cancer cell survival despite the oncogenic stress could provide a molecular basis for potential therapeutic interventions. Here we explore the role of pro-survival genes in cancer cell integrity during clonal evolution in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We identify gains of MCL-1 at high frequency in multiple independent NSCLC cohorts, occurring both clonally and subclonally. Clonal loss of functional TP53 is significantly associated with subclonal gains of MCL-1. In mice, tumour progression is delayed upon pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of MCL-1.

CC1007, a BML-210 analog, is designed to indirectly inhibit class IIa HDACs by binding to myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) and blocking the recruitment of class IIa HDACs to MEF2-targeted genes to enhance the expression of these targets. In this study, we investigated the anticancer effects of CC1007 in breakpoint cluster region-Abelson 1 fusion gene-negative (BCR-ABL1(-)) pre-B-ALL cell lines and primary patient-derived BCR-ABL1(-) pre-B-ALL cells. CC1007 had obvious antileukemic activity toward pre-B-ALL cells in vitro and in vivo; it also significantly prolonged median survival time of pre-B-ALL-bearing mice. Interestingly, low dose of CC1007 could inhibit proliferation of BCR-ABL1(-) pre-B-ALL cells in a time-dependent manner not accompanied by significant cell apoptosis, but along with cross-lineage differentiation toward monocytic lineage. From a mechanistic angle, we showed that HDAC7 was overexpressed in BCR-ABL1(-) pre-B-ALL cells compared to normal bone marrow samples, and CC1007 could reduce the binding of HDAC7 at the promoters of monocyte-macrophage-specific genes via inhibition of HDAC7 expression and HDAC7:MEF2C interaction. These data indicated that CC1007 may be a promising agent for the treatment of BCR-ABL1(-) pre-B-ALL.","['Wang, Zhihua', 'Zhang, Yang', 'Zhu, Shicong', 'Peng, Hongling', 'Chen, Yongheng', 'Cheng, Zhao', 'Liu, Sufang', 'Luo, Yunya', 'Li, Ruijuan', 'Deng, Mingyang', 'Xu, Yunxiao', 'Hu, Guoyu', 'Chen, Lin', 'Zhang, Guangsen']","['Wang Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhu S', 'Peng H', 'Chen Y', 'Cheng Z', 'Liu S', 'Luo Y', 'Li R', 'Deng M', 'Xu Y', 'Hu G', 'Chen L', 'Zhang G']",,"['Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Oncology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Geriatrics, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Laboratory of Structural Biology, Key Laboratory of Cancer Proteomics of Chinese Ministry of Health, Xiangya Hospital & State Key Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Zhuzhou Hospital of Xiangya Medical College, Central South University, Zhuzhou, Hunan, China.', 'Molecular and Computational Biology Program, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90089, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China. zgsllzy@163.com.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China. zgsllzy@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200910,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",PMC7483467,,,2020/09/12 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/09/11 05:40'],"['2020/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/11 05:40 [entrez]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-02949-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-02949-1 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Sep 10;11(9):738. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-02949-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study describes the thrombotic and hemorrhagic manifestations of APL in pediatric patients and evaluates their hemostasis, based on coagulation tests. METHODS: Inclusion criteria were age 0-18 years and APL diagnosis between April 2005 and November 2017. Patients who had received blood transfusion prior to coagulation tests were excluded. Baseline coagulation tests, hematologic counts, and hemorrhagic/thrombotic manifestations were evaluated. RESULTS: Median age was 10.7 years (1-15 years). The initial coagulation tests revealed a median Hgb of 8.3g/dL (4.7-12.9g/dL), median leucocyte count of 10.9x10(9)/L (1.1-95.8x10(9)/L), median platelet count of 31.8x10(9)/L (2.0-109.0x10(9)/L), median activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 31.7s (23.0-50.4s), median aPTT ratio of 1.0 (0.78-1.6), median thromboplastin time (PT) of 17.5s (13.8-27.7s), median PT activity of 62% (25-95 %), and median fibrinogen of 157.7mg/dL (60.0-281.0mg/dL). Three patients (13%) had thrombosis. At diagnosis, 21 patients (91.3%) had bruising, one patient (4.3%) had splenic vein and artery thrombosis and one patient (4.3%) presented without thrombohemorrhagic manifestations. During treatment, two patients (8.6%) had thrombosis. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of thrombosis in pediatric APL is important to determine its risk factors and the best way to treat and prevent this complication.","['de Albuquerque Antunes, Alexandre', 'Breviglieri, Carla Nolasco Monteiro', 'Celeste, Daniele Martins', 'Garanito, Marlene Pereira', 'Cristofani, Lilian Maria', 'Carneiro, Jorge David Aivazoglou']","['de Albuquerque Antunes A', 'Breviglieri CNM', 'Celeste DM', 'Garanito MP', 'Cristofani LM', 'Carneiro JDA']",,"['Instituto da Crianca, Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo (FMUSP), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.

Several Studies have found that aberrations in DNA methylation process play a crucial role in leukemogenesis. The aim of this case control study was to evaluate the association between rs1569686, rs2424913 polymorphisms located in DNMT3B gene and rs7590760 polymorphism located in DNMT3A gene and AML risk in a Moroccan population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was conducted in 142 cases of AML and 179 control subjects from the Moroccan population. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood samples by salting-out method and the genotype of the three polymorphisms was determined by the PCR-RFLP technique. RESULTS: The study results indicated that rs1569686 polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of AML in dominant model (OR=1.72, 95 % CI 1.01-2.95, P=0.04), but not in recessive model. In stratified analysis by gender, statistically significant association between the rs2424913 CT genotype and AML was found among males (OR=2.05, 95 % CI 1.00-4.19, P=0.04). Similarly, the rs1569686 TT genotype was associated with an increase risk of AML (OR=3.21, 95 % CI 1.15-8. 98, P=0.02), this association was also found under dominant genetic model (OR=2.47, 95 % CI 1.07-5. 67, P=0.03) among males. However, the rs2424913 polymorphism was not associated with AML. CONCLUSION: Our findings have shown that rs1569686 polymorphism might be a risk factor of AML in males. While, the rs2424913 polymorphism was not associated with AML. Further studies with a large sample size are needed to validate our results.","['Ait Boujmia, Oum Kaltoum', 'Nadifi, Sellama', 'Dehbi, Hind', 'Lamchahab, Mouna', 'Quessar, Asma']","['Ait Boujmia OK', 'Nadifi S', 'Dehbi H', 'Lamchahab M', 'Quessar A']",,"['Laboratory of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Medical School, University Hassan II, Casablanca, Morocco; Department of Onco-Hematology, Ibn Rochd University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco.

Derivatives of BTN3A1 ligand prodrugs were synthesized that contain an acetate-protected allylic alcohol and act as doubly protected prodrugs. A novel set of phosphonates, phosphoramidates, and phosphonamidates has been prepared through a new route that simplifies synthesis and postpones the point of divergence into different prodrug forms. One of the new prodrugs, compound 11, potently stimulates gammadelta T cell proliferation (72 h EC50 = 0.12 nM) and interferon gamma response to loaded leukemia cells (4 h EC50 = 19 nM). This phosphonamidate form was > 900x more potent than the corresponding phosphoramidate, and the phosphonamidate form was also significantly more stable in plasma following acetate hydrolysis. Therefore, prodrug modification of phosphonate butyrophilin ligands at the allylic alcohol can both facilitate chemical synthesis and improve potency of gammadelta T cell stimulation.","['Harmon, Nyema M', 'Huang, Xueting', 'Schladetsch, Megan A', 'Hsiao, Chia-Hung Christine', 'Wiemer, Andrew J', 'Wiemer, David F']","['Harmon NM', 'Huang X', 'Schladetsch MA', 'Hsiao CC', 'Wiemer AJ', 'Wiemer DF']",,"['Department of Chemistry, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52245, United States.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269, United States.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269, United States.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269, United States.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269, United States; Institute for Systems Genomics, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52245, United States; Department of Pharmacology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, United States.

The viral transactivator of the pX region (Tax) is important for initiating malignant transformation, and deregulation of the major signaling pathway nuclear factor of kappa B (NF-kappaB) by Tax represents a hallmark of HTLV-1 driven cancer. RESULTS: Here we found that Tax mutants which are defective in NF-kappaB signaling showed diminished protein expression levels compared to Tax wildtype in T-cells, whereas Tax transcript levels were comparable. Strikingly, constant activation of NF-kappaB signaling by the constitutive active mutant of inhibitor of kappa B kinase (IKK2, IKK-beta), IKK2-EE, rescued protein expression of the NF-kappaB defective Tax mutants M22 and K1-10R and even increased protein levels of Tax wildtype in various T-cell lines while Tax transcript levels were only slightly affected. Using several Tax expression constructs, an increase of Tax protein occurred independent of Tax transcripts and independent of the promoter used. Further, Tax and M22 protein expression were strongly enhanced by 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-Acetate [TPA; Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)]/ ionomycin, inducers of NF-kappaB and cytokine signaling, but not by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). On the other hand, co-expression of Tax with a dominant negative inhibitor of kappaB, IkappaBalpha-DN, or specific inhibition of IKK2 by the compound ACHP, led to a vast decrease in Tax protein levels to some extent independent of Tax transcripts in transiently transfected and Tax-transformed T-cells. Cycloheximide chase experiments revealed that co-expression of IKK2-EE prolongs the half-life of M22, and constant repression of NF-kappaB signaling by IkappaBalpha-DN strongly reduces protein stability of Tax wildtype suggesting that NF-kappaB activity is required for Tax protein stability. Finally, protein expression of Tax and M22 could be recovered by NH4Cl and PYR-41, inhibitors of the lysosome and the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings suggest that Tax's capability to induce NF-kappaB is critical for protein expression and stabilization of Tax itself. Overall, identification of this novel positive feedback loop between Tax and NF-kappaB in T-cells improves our understanding of Tax-driven transformation.","['Millen, Sebastian', 'Meretuk, Lina', 'Gottlicher, Tim', 'Schmitt, Sarah', 'Fleckenstein, Bernhard', 'Thoma-Kress, Andrea K']","['Millen S', 'Meretuk L', 'Gottlicher T', 'Schmitt S', 'Fleckenstein B', 'Thoma-Kress AK']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8568-9526'],"['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Universitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany. andrea.thoma-kress@uk-erlangen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200910,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NFKB1 protein, human)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Feedback, Physiological', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Stability', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",PMC7488018,['NOTNLM'],"['*HTLV-1', '*IKK2', '*M22', '*NF-kappaB', '*Protein stability', '*Tax-1']",2020/09/12 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/09/11 05:31'],"['2020/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/11 05:31 [entrez]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-020-00538-w [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-020-00538-w [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2020 Sep 10;17(1):30. doi: 10.1186/s12977-020-00538-w.,,"['TH2166/1-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/International', 'GRK2504, A2/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/International', 'A91/Interdisziplinares Zentrum fur Klinische Forschung, Universitatsklinikum', 'Erlangen, FAU Erlangen-Nurnberg (DE)/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcome can be explained by the patients' immunity status and late diagnosis and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the rare case of successful outcome in a 61-year-old female who developed alveolar haemorrhage and acute respiratory distress syndrome 8 days after a chemotherapy session for her acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, in the context of secondary bone marrow aplasia. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was isolated in sputum culture. The patient benefitted from early empirical treatment with colistin followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, according to the antibiogram. Despite a severe initial clinical presentation in need of mechanical ventilation, neuromuscular blocking agents infusion, and ventilation in prone position, the patient had a favourable outcome and was discharged from intensive care after 26 days. CONCLUSIONS: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia severe pneumonia complicated with pulmonary haemorrhage is not always fatal in haematological patients. Empirical treatment of multidrug-resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in an immunocompromised haematological patient presenting with hemoptysis should be taken into consideration.","['Andrei, Stefan', 'Ghiaur, Alexandra', 'Brezeanu, Lavinia', 'Martac, Cristina', 'Nicolau, Andreea', 'Coriu, Daniel', 'Droc, Gabriela']","['Andrei S', 'Ghiaur A', 'Brezeanu L', 'Martac C', 'Nicolau A', 'Coriu D', 'Droc G']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0216-1380'],"['1st Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Fundeni Clinical Institute, 258 Soseaua Fundeni, Sector 2, 022328, Bucharest, Romania. stefan.m.andrei@gmail.com.', 'Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 8 Bulevardul Eroii Sanitari, 050474, Bucharest, Romania. stefan.m.andrei@gmail.com.', 'Department of Haematology, Fundeni Clinical Institute, 258 Soseaua Fundeni, Sector 2, 022328, Bucharest, Romania.', '1st Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Fundeni Clinical Institute, 258 Soseaua Fundeni, Sector 2, 022328, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 8 Bulevardul Eroii Sanitari, 050474, Bucharest, Romania.', '1st Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Fundeni Clinical Institute, 258 Soseaua Fundeni, Sector 2, 022328, Bucharest, Romania.', '1st Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Fundeni Clinical Institute, 258 Soseaua Fundeni, Sector 2, 022328, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 8 Bulevardul Eroii Sanitari, 050474, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Haematology, Fundeni Clinical Institute, 258 Soseaua Fundeni, Sector 2, 022328, Bucharest, Romania.', '1st Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Fundeni Clinical Institute, 258 Soseaua Fundeni, Sector 2, 022328, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 8 Bulevardul Eroii Sanitari, 050474, Bucharest, Romania.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200910,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', 'Z67X93HJG1 (Colistin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Colistin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/complications', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Hemorrhage/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/pathology', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/*drug therapy/etiology/microbiology', 'Sputum/microbiology', 'Stenotrophomonas maltophilia/*isolation & purification', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/*therapeutic use']",PMC7482381,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute respiratory distress syndrome', 'Pulmonary haemorrhage', 'Stenotrophomonas maltophilia']",2020/09/12 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/09/11 05:30'],"['2019/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/11 05:30 [entrez]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-020-05378-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-020-05378-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2020 Sep 10;20(1):658. doi: 10.1186/s12879-020-05378-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an irreversible inhibitor of the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) enzyme, has shown promising inhibitory activities in many cancers including leukemia by decreasing the biosynthesis of the intracellular polyamines. The present study aimed to investigate the combinatorial cytotoxic effects of TQ and DFMO on human acute T lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells and to determine the underlying mechanisms. Here, we show that the combination of DFMO and TQ significantly reduced cell viability and resulted in significant synergistic effects on apoptosis when compared to either DFMO or TQ alone. RNA-sequencing showed that many key epigenetic players including Ubiquitin-like containing PHD and Ring finger 1 (UHRF1) and its 2 partners DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) were down-regulated in DFMO-treated Jurkat cells. The combination of DFMO and TQ dramatically decreased the expression of UHRF1, DNMT1 and HDAC1 genes compared to either DFMO or TQ alone. UHRF1 knockdown led to a decrease in Jurkat cell viability. In conclusion, these results suggest that the combination of DFMO and TQ could be a promising new strategy for the treatment of human acute T lymphoblastic leukemia by targeting the epigenetic code.","['Alhosin, Mahmoud', 'Razvi, Syed Shoeb I', 'Sheikh, Ryan A', 'Khan, Jalaluddin A', 'Zamzami, Mazin A', 'Choudhry, Hani']","['Alhosin M', 'Razvi SSI', 'Sheikh RA', 'Khan JA', 'Zamzami MA', 'Choudhry H']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6590-2871'],"['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, 37848King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer Metabolism and Epigenetic Unit, Faculty of Science, 37848King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, 37848King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Math and Science Department, 441417Community College of Qatar, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, 37848King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, 37848King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, 37848King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer Metabolism and Epigenetic Unit, Faculty of Science, 37848King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, 37848King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Cancer Metabolism and Epigenetic Unit, Faculty of Science, 37848King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', 'O60IE26NUF (thymoquinone)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Eflornithine/*pharmacology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC7488875,['NOTNLM'],"['*DFMO', '*apoptosis', '*epigenetics', '*gene expression', '*thymoquinone']",2020/09/12 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2020/09/11 05:30'],"['2020/09/11 05:30 [entrez]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1533033820947489 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2020 Jan-Dec;19:1533033820947489. doi: 10.1177/1533033820947489.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The process typically occurs in patients with a history of chronic myeloproliferative disorders and may afflict the skin, lung, breast, gastrointestinal tract, breast, kidney, lymph node, and thyroid gland. In this article, we report the case of a 37-year-old female with more than 5 years history of acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia who presented with right upper quadrant pain and tenderness. Computed tomography scan showed multiple new ring-enhancing low-density lesions within the right and left hepatic lobes. A computed tomography-guided liver core biopsy was performed on one of the new liver lesions and showed extramedullary hematopoiesis with atypical megakaryocytes and sinusoidal capillarization with associated fibroblastic proliferation. Numerous atypical megakaryocytes were scattered in the background of haphazard collagen deposition. No significant blasts or a leukemic process were identified. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed extensive reticulin fibrosis (MF-3), trilineage dysplasia, increased blasts (10% to 19%), and hypercellularity (close to 100%), which was consistent with MDS-EB-2. Cytogenetics was reported as follows: 44~46,XX,-3,add(3)(p13),-5,-6,-7,17,del(17)(p12),+1~5mar[cp9]/46,XX. Molecular analysis was negative for both JAK2 V617F and CALR exon 9 activating mutations.

The therapeutic management of AML requires understanding the mechanisms involved in the fragility and immune dysfunction of AML T lymphocytes. METHODS: In this study, T lymphocytes from healthy donors (HD) and AML patients were used. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from leukemic cells were screened for their microRNA content and impact on T lymphocytes. Flow cytometry, transcriptomic as well as lentiviral transduction techniques were used to carry out the research. RESULTS: We observed increased cell death of T lymphocytes from AML patients. EVs from leukemia myeloid cell lines harbored several miRNAs, including miR-21, and were able to induce T lymphocyte death. Compared to that in HD, miR-21 was overexpressed in both the bone marrow fluid and infiltrating T lymphocytes of AML patients. MiR-21 induces T lymphocyte cell death by upregulating proapoptotic gene expression. It also increases the immunosuppressive profile of T lymphocytes by upregulating the IL13, IL4, IL10, and FoxP3 genes.

The extent of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor's targets determines the degree of biologic effects of the agent that may influence the well-being of the patient. This fact is especially true with tyrosine kinase inhibitor effects on the cardiovascular system. Thirty-one percent of ponatinib-treated patients, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the broadest inhibitory spectrum, have thrombosis associated with its use.

In both cases, binary or multilevel strings encoding gene expressions are considered as descriptors. It is shown how the SSIR procedure is useful for ranking the series of patient transcription data to diagnose two types of cancer (leukemia and prostate cancer) obtaining Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (AU-ROC) values of 0.95 (leukemia prediction) and 0.80-0.90 (prostate).

Hundreds of thousands of endogenous circRNAs have been found in mammalian cells, which we knew little before. CircRNAs are covalently closed, circular RNA molecules that typically comprise exonic sequences and are spliced at canonical splice sites. Researchers with RNA-Seq technology have identified that the expression of circRNAs is developmentally regulated, tissue- and cell-type specific. Like long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), circRNAs are becoming a new research hotspot in the RNA field, and aberrant expression of circRNAs could contribute to carcinogenesis. Recent studies have demonstrated that circRNAs play important roles in the development, maintenance, and progression of leukemia. Herein, we describe the biologic characteristics and functions of circRNAs, with a focus on circRNAs that play essential roles in leukemia.","['Fu, Lei', 'Tang, Doudou', 'Sun, Ailian', 'Zhu, Dengqin', 'Zhang, Guangsen', 'Wang, Yewei']","['Fu L', 'Tang D', 'Sun A', 'Zhu D', 'Zhang G', 'Wang Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2213-5198'],"['Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Hunan Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Molecular Hematology, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200910,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Circular)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'RNA, Circular/*genetics', 'Terminology as Topic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*circRNA', '*diagnosis', '*function', '*leukemia', '*prognosis']",2020/09/11 06:00,2021/05/05 06:00,['2020/09/10 20:23'],"['2020/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/10 20:23 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.2RU0619-213R [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2021 Apr;109(4):731-739. doi: 10.1002/JLB.2RU0619-213R.

Although genetic predispositions are frequent in children (>1% to 5%), fewer than 1% of genetically predisposed carriers will develop pB-ALL. Although infectious stimuli are believed to play a major role in leukemogenesis, the critical determinants are not well defined. Here, by using murine models of pB-ALL, we show that microbiome disturbances incurred by antibiotic treatment early in life were sufficient to induce leukemia in genetically predisposed mice, even in the absence of infectious stimuli and independent of T cells. By using V4 and full-length 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing of a series of fecal samples, we found that genetic predisposition to pB-ALL (Pax5 heterozygosity or ETV6-RUNX1 fusion) shaped a distinct gut microbiome. Machine learning accurately (96.8%) predicted genetic predisposition using 40 of 3983 amplicon sequence variants as proxies for bacterial species. Transplantation of either wild-type (WT) or Pax5+/- hematopoietic bone marrow cells into WT recipient mice revealed that the microbiome is shaped and determined in a donor genotype-specific manner. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of sera from WT and Pax5+/- mice demonstrated the presence of a genotype-specific distinct metabolomic profile. Taken together, our data indicate that it is a lack of commensal microbiota rather than the presence of specific bacteria that promotes leukemia in genetically predisposed mice. Future large-scale longitudinal studies are required to determine whether targeted microbiome modification in children predisposed to pB-ALL could become a successful prevention strategy.","['Vicente-Duenas, Carolina', 'Janssen, Stefan', 'Oldenburg, Marina', 'Auer, Franziska', 'Gonzalez-Herrero, Ines', 'Casado-Garcia, Ana', 'Isidro-Hernandez, Marta', 'Raboso-Gallego, Javier',

However, its role in myeloid malignancies remains unclear. Here, we explored the role of BCL6 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). BCL6 was expressed at variable and often high levels in AML cell lines and primary AML samples. AMLs with higher levels of BCL6 were generally sensitive to treatment with BCL6 inhibitors, with the exception of those with monocytic differentiation. Gene expression profiling of AML cells treated with a BCL6 inhibitor revealed induction of BCL6-repressed target genes and transcriptional programs linked to DNA damage checkpoints and downregulation of stem cell genes. Ex vivo treatment of primary AML cells with BCL6 inhibitors induced apoptosis and decreased colony-forming capacity, which correlated with the levels of BCL6 expression. Importantly, inhibition or knockdown of BCL6 in primary AML cells resulted in a significant reduction of leukemia-initiating capacity in mice, suggesting ablation of leukemia repopulating cell functionality. In contrast, BCL6 knockout or inhibition did not suppress the function of normal hematopoietic stem cells. Treatment with cytarabine further induced BCL6 expression, and the levels of BCL6 induction were correlated with resistance to cytarabine.

Overexpression of these two factors has been associated with increased processes involved in carcinogenesis, such as invasion, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, metastasis, cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, resistance to cell death due to loss of adhesion (anoikis), activation of cell proliferation pathways, regulation of tumor suppressor genes, and drug resistance, and is related to advanced clinical stage. Inhibition of the TrkB/BDNF axis using drugs in phase 1 studies, approved drugs, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) are promising strategies for the treatment of various malignant tumors in addition to increasing the sensitivity of cells resistant to chemotherapy, improving the effectiveness of drugs without increasing toxicity. Another factor related to poor cancer prognosis is the presence of cancer stem cells, having effects similar to the high expression of the TrkB/BDNF axis, on cancer. This review aimed to show the role of the TrkB/BDNF axis in several types of cancer, its possible use as a prognostic biomarker, the effects of inhibiting this axis, and its role in the cancer stem cells.","['Serafim Junior, Vilson', 'Fernandes, Glaucia Maria de Mendonca', 'Oliveira-Cucolo, Juliana Garcia de', 'Pavarino, Erika Cristina', 'Goloni-Bertollo, Eny Maria']","['Serafim Junior V', 'Fernandes GMM', 'Oliveira-Cucolo JG', 'Pavarino EC', 'Goloni-Bertollo EM']",,"['Genetics and Molecular Biology Research Unit (UPGEM), Sao Jose do Rio Preto Medical School (FAMERP), Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Genetics and Molecular Biology Research Unit (UPGEM), Sao Jose do Rio Preto Medical School (FAMERP), Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Genetics and Molecular Biology Research Unit (UPGEM), Sao Jose do Rio Preto Medical School (FAMERP), Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Genetics and Molecular Biology Research Unit (UPGEM), Sao Jose do Rio Preto Medical School (FAMERP), Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Genetics and Molecular Biology Research Unit (UPGEM), Sao Jose do Rio Preto Medical School (FAMERP), Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

To understand ibrutinib's effects on the broader landscape of immune cell populations, we comprehensively characterized changes in circulating counts of 21 immune blood cell subsets throughout the first year of treatment in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL (n = 55, RESONATE) and previously untreated CLL (n = 50, RESONATE-2) compared with untreated age-matched healthy donors (n = 20). Ibrutinib normalized abnormal immune cell counts to levels similar to those of age-matched healthy donors. Ibrutinib significantly decreased pathologically high circulating B cells, regulatory T cells, effector/memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (including exhausted and chronically activated T cells), natural killer (NK) T cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells; preserved naive T cells and NK cells; and increased circulating classical monocytes. T-cell function was assessed in response to T-cell receptor stimulation in patients with R/R CLL (n = 21) compared with age-matched healthy donors (n = 18). Ibrutinib significantly restored T-cell proliferative ability, degranulation, and cytokine secretion. Over the same period, ofatumumab or chlorambucil did not confer the same spectrum of normalization as ibrutinib in multiple immune subsets. These results establish that ibrutinib has a significant and likely positive impact on circulating malignant and nonmalignant immune cells and restores healthy T-cell function.","['Solman, Isabelle G', 'Blum, Lisa K', 'Hoh, Hana Y', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Barrientos, Jacqueline C', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Mulligan, Stephen P', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Byrd, John C', 'Lal, Indu D', 'Dean, James P', 'Mongan, Ann']","['Solman IG', 'Blum LK', 'Hoh HY', 'Kipps TJ', 'Burger JA', 'Barrientos JC', ""O'Brien S"", 'Mulligan SP', 'Kay NE', 'Hillmen P', 'Byrd JC', 'Lal ID', 'Dean JP', 'Mongan A']",,"['Translational Medicine, Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, United States.', 'Translational Medicine, Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, United States.', 'Research, Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, UCSD Moores Cancer Center, San Diego, CA, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Northwell Health Cancer Institute, Donald & Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Lake Success, NY, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, UC Irvine, Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Irvine, CA, United States.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Rochester, MN, United States.', 'Department of Haematology, The Leeds Teaching Hospitals, St. James Institute of Oncology, Leeds, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, United States.', 'Clinical Science, Pharmacyclics LLC, An AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, United States.', 'Clinical Science, Pharmacyclics LLC, An AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, United States.', 'Translational Medicine, Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie Company, Sunnyvale, CA, United States.

Currently, tissue engineering has the potential to achieve tissue manipulation, regeneration, and growth, but personalization and precision remain challenges. The application of ""3D cell printing"" is more in line with the clinical requirements of tissue repair. In this study, a porous grid-type human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cell (hiMSC)-loaded hydrogel scaffold was constructed using a 3D bioprinting device. The 3D-printed hydrogel scaffold provided a permissive in vitro living environment for hiMSCs and significantly increased the survival duration of transplanted hiMSCs when compared with hiMSCs administered locally in vivo. Using an endometrial injury model, we found that hiMSC transplantation can cause early host immune responses (the serological immune response continued for more than 1 month, and the local immune response continued for approximately 1 week). Compared with the sham group, although the regenerative endometrium failed to show full restoration of the normal structure and function of the lining, implantation of the 3D-printed hiMSC-loaded scaffold not only promoted the recovery of the endometrial histomorphology (endometrial tissue and gland regeneration) and the regeneration of endometrial cells (stromal cells and epithelial cells) and endothelial cells but also improved endometrial receptivity functional indicators, namely, pinopode formation and leukemia inhibitory factor and alphavbeta3 expression, which partly restored the embryo implantation and pregnancy maintenance functions of the injured endometrium. These indicators were significantly better in the 3D-printed hiMSC-loaded scaffold group than in the unrepaired (empty) group, the hiMSCs alone group and the 3D scaffold group, and the empty group showed the worst repair results. Our study confirm that the 3D-printed hiMSC-loaded hydrogel scaffold may be a promising material for endometrial repair.","['Ji, Wanqing', 'Hou, Bo', 'Lin, Weige', 'Wang, Linli', 'Zheng, Wenhan', 'Li, Weidong', 'Zheng, Jie', 'Wen, Xuejun', 'He, Ping']","['Ji W', 'Hou B', 'Lin W', 'Wang L', 'Zheng W', 'Li W', 'Zheng J', 'Wen X', 'He P']",,"[""Department of Obstetrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510623, China."", 'Departments of Neurosurgery, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510630, China.', ""Department of Obstetrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510623, China."", 'Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine Research Center, Future Homo sapiens Research Institute Co., Ltd., China.', 'Departments of Neurosurgery, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510630, China.', ""Department of Maternal and Child Health Information, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Obstetrics, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, 510623, China."", 'Department of Chemical and Life Science Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, 601 West Main Street, Richmond, VA 23220, USA.

Imatinib, a BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is a revolutionary molecular target inhibitor for CML. However, leukemic stem cells (LSCs) eventually become resistant to imatinib and thereby cause relapse. The next-generation BCR-ABL1 TKI dasatinib is also unable to eliminate CML LSCs. On the other hand, the third-generation BCR-ABL1 TKI ponatinib is not well studied in terms of its efficacy on CML LSCs. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of ponatinib against CML LSC-containing lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) (LSK) cells using a mouse CML-like model. To this end, we compared the efficacy of imatinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib on CML LSK cells and showed that ponatinib is more effective at eliminating CML LSK cells. Our results suggest that ponatinib could be potentially useful for achieving treatment-free remission in CML patients.","['Tanaka, Yosuke', 'Fukushima, Tsuyoshi', 'Mikami, Keiko', 'Adachi, Keito', 'Fukuyama, Tomofusa', 'Goyama, Susumu', 'Kitamura, Toshio']","['Tanaka Y', 'Fukushima T', 'Mikami K', 'Adachi K', 'Fukuyama T', 'Goyama S', 'Kitamura T']",,"['Division of Cellular Therapy, The Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan.

The distributions provide not only the most stable but also semistable complex structures and propose a ligand-receptor binding process. This method was applied to a system consisting of a receptor protein, 14-3-3epsilon, and a flexible peptide, phosphorylated myeloid leukemia factor 1 (pMLF1). The results present comprehensive binding pathways of pMLF1 to 14-3-3epsilon. We identified four thermodynamically stable clusters of MLF1 on the 14-3-3epsilon surface and free-energy barriers among some clusters. The most stable cluster includes two high-density spots connected by a narrow corridor. When pMLF1 passes the corridor, a salt-bridge relay (switching) related to the phosphorylated residue of pMLF1 occurs. Conformations in one high-density spot are similar to the experimentally determined complex structure. Three-dimensional distributions of residues in the intermolecular interface rationally explain the binding constant changes resulting from the alanine mutation experiment for the residues. We also performed a simulation of nonphosphorylated peptide and 14-3-3epsilon, which demonstrated that the complex structure was unstable, suggesting that phosphorylation of the peptide is crucially important for binding to 14-3-3epsilon.","['Higo, Junichi', 'Kawabata, Takeshi', 'Kusaka, Ayumi', 'Kasahara, Kota', 'Kamiya, Narutoshi', 'Fukuda, Ikuo', 'Mori, Kentaro', 'Hata, Yutaka', 'Fukunishi, Yoshifumi', 'Nakamura, Haruki']","['Higo J', 'Kawabata T', 'Kusaka A', 'Kasahara K', 'Kamiya N', 'Fukuda I', 'Mori K', 'Hata Y', 'Fukunishi Y', 'Nakamura H']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0408-1907', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0032-9688', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0207-6271', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0527-6968']","['Graduate School of Simulation Studies, University of Hyogo, 7-1-28 Minatojima Minami-machi, Chuo-ku, Kobe, Hyogo 650-0047, Japan.', 'Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, 3-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.', 'Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, 3-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.', 'College of Life Sciences, Ritsumeikan University, 1-1-1 Noji-higashi, Kusatsu, Shiga 525-8577, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Simulation Studies, University of Hyogo, 7-1-28 Minatojima Minami-machi, Chuo-ku, Kobe, Hyogo 650-0047, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Simulation Studies, University of Hyogo, 7-1-28 Minatojima Minami-machi, Chuo-ku, Kobe, Hyogo 650-0047, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Simulation Studies, University of Hyogo, 7-1-28 Minatojima Minami-machi, Chuo-ku, Kobe, Hyogo 650-0047, Japan.', 'Maizuru College, 234 Shiroya, Maizuru, Kyoto 625-8511 Japan.', 'Graduate School of Simulation Studies, University of Hyogo, 7-1-28 Minatojima Minami-machi, Chuo-ku, Kobe, Hyogo 650-0047, Japan.', 'Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 2-3-26, Aomi, Koto-ku, Tokyo 135-0064, Japan.', 'Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, 3-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200922,United States,J Chem Inf Model,Journal of chemical information and modeling,101230060,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['*14-3-3 Proteins/genetics', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', '*Peptides', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation']",,,,2020/09/11 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/09/10 20:10'],"['2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/10 20:10 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00551 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chem Inf Model. 2020 Oct 26;60(10):4867-4880. doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00551.

DLEU1 levels were higher in PTC cell lines (BHP5-16, TPC-1,8505C, and SW1736) and patient tissues (n=54) than in a human thyroid follicular epithelial cell line (Nthy-ori3-1) or adjacent normal thyroid tissues. High DLEU1 expression correlated positively with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stages in PTC patients. Bioinformatics, dual luciferase reporter, and RNA pulldown assays confirmed that DLEU1 directly binds to miR-421. Moreover, bioinformatics and dual luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-421 directly binds to the 3'untranslated region of the rho-related coiled-coil kinase 1 (ROCK1) in TPC-1 cells. PTC patient tissues and cell lines showed high ROCK1 mRNA and protein levels as well as low miR-421 levels. CCK-8, flow cytometry, wound healing, and Transwell invasion assays demonstrated that DLEU1 silencing decreases TPC-1 cell proliferation, survival and progression, but they can be rescued by miR-421 knockdown or ROCK1 overexpression. DLEU1 knockdown in TPC-1 cells decreased in vivo xenograft tumor size and weight compared to controls in nude mice. These findings demonstrate that DLEU1 promotes PTC progression by sponging miR-421 and increasing ROCK1 expression.","['Li, Rui', 'Wan, Taihu', 'Qu, Jie', 'Yu, Yang', 'Zheng, Ruipeng']","['Li R', 'Wan T', 'Qu J', 'Yu Y', 'Zheng R']",,"['Department of Thyroid Surgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, P.R.

This assay, however, has several drawbacks and flow cytometry has been used as an alternative to measure cytotoxic activity. Here, we present a quantitative method for cell-mediated cytotoxicity studies, preserving cellular function with minimal sample manipulation. Cytotoxic activity is simply and reproducibly measured as the ability of cytotoxic cells to lyse K562 target cells previously loaded with Calcein-AM vital stain. After spiking a known number of fluorescent viable K562 target cells into whole blood, cell mixtures are incubated for 2 h in a cell incubator and the remaining spiked cells are counted by flow cytometry. In order to discriminate nucleated cells, erythrocytes, and debris, unlysed whole blood is stained with a cell permeable DNA vital fluorescent dye. Cell-mediated lysis is measured by comparing target counts for different effector-to-target ratios. Since the cytotoxicity of these dyes is relatively low, this method can be broadly applied to studies of innate immune response to tumors and infections, especially where target-killing activity might be compromised by small volume samples or low frequency of cytotoxic cells.

This study was aimed at determining whether the distance to treatment center affects overall survival for children and young adults with acute leukemia. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients 39 years old or younger who were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A backward elimination procedure was used to select final multivariate Cox models. RESULTS: In total, 12,301 patients with AML and 22,683 patients with ALL were analyzed. The ALL model included distance to treatment center, Charlson-Deyo score, age, race, insurance status, and community income level. US census definitions of urban and rural were not statistically significant, and no interaction was significant for included variables. Compared with distances > 50 miles, all other distances were associated with improved survival (hazard ratio [HR] for </=10 miles, 0.91; P = .04; HR for >10 to </=20 miles, 0.86; P = .004; HR for >20 to </=50 miles, 0.87; P = .005). The final model for AML included the same variables as the ALL model except for distance to treatment center, which was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: For children and young adults with ALL, distances > 50 miles are associated with inferior overall survival; however, no difference is seen for AML. Although it is unknown whether differences in survival for patients with ALL based on distance are driven by relapse or treatment-related mortality, increased attention to adherence, supportive care, and logistics for patients traveling long distances is warranted. LAY SUMMARY: For children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, living more than 50 miles from the treatment center is associated with worse outcomes.","['Rotz, Seth J', 'Wei, Wei', 'Thomas, Stefanie M', 'Hanna, Rabi']","['Rotz SJ', 'Wei W', 'Thomas SM', 'Hanna R']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2896-1113', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3225-7129']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Pediatric Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Lerner Research Institute Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Pediatric Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Pediatric Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200910,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Rural Health Services', 'Time Factors', 'Travel', 'Urban Health Services', 'Young Adult']",PMC7686274,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*adolescents and young adults (AYAs)', '*children', '*distance', '*pediatrics', '*survival', '*treatment center']",2020/09/11 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/09/10 12:28'],"['2020/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/10 12:28 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33175 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Dec 15;126(24):5319-5327. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33175.

However, there are still few data on COVID-19 occurring in hematologic patients. METHODS: One hundred two patients with COVID-19 symptoms and a nasopharyngeal swab positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 seen at 2 hematologic departments located in Lombardy, Italy, during March 2020 were studied. Risk factors for acquiring COVID-19 were analyzed by comparisons of patients with COVID-19 and the standard hematologic population managed at the same institutions in 2019. Thirty-day survival was compared with the survival of matched uninfected control patients with similar hematologic disorders and nonhematologic patients affected by COVID-19. RESULTS: Male sex was significantly more prevalent in patients with COVID-19. The infection occurred across all different types of hematologic disease; however, the risk of acquiring a COVID-19 infection was lower for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, including chronic myeloid leukemia, and higher for patients with immune-mediated anemia on immunosuppressive-related treatments. The 30-day mortality rate was 39.2%, which was higher than the rates for nonhematologic patients with COVID-19 (23.5%; P = .02) and uninfected hematologic controls (3%; P < .001). The severity of the respiratory syndrome at presentation and active hematologic treatment were independently associated with a worse prognosis. Neither diagnosis nor disease status affected the prognosis. The worst prognosis was demonstrated among patients on active hematologic treatment and those with more severe respiratory syndrome at COVID-19 presentation. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients should be advised to seek medical attention at the earliest signs of dyspnea and/or respiratory infection. Physicians should perform a risk-benefit analysis to determine the impact of temporarily deferring nonlifesaving treatments versus the risk of adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19. LAY SUMMARY: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection occurs across all different types of hematologic disease; however, the risk of acquiring it is lower for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, including chronic myeloid leukemia, and higher for patients with immune-mediated anemia on immunosuppressive treatment. The 30-day mortality rate is 39.2%, which is far higher than the rates for both uninfected hematologic controls (3%; P < .001) and nonhematologic patients with COVID-19 (23.5%; P = .02) despite matching for age, sex, comorbidities, and severity of disease. Variables independently associated with a worse prognosis are the severity of the respiratory syndrome at presentation and any type of active hematologic treatment. Neither diagnosis nor disease status influence the prognosis.","['Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Daffini, Rosa', 'Pagani, Chiara', 'Salvetti, Massimo', 'Mancini, Valentina', 'Borlenghi, Erika', ""D'Adda, Mariella"", 'Oberti, Margherita', 'Paini, Anna', 'De Ciuceis, Carolina', 'Barbullushi, Kordelia', 'Cancelli, Valeria', 'Belotti, Angelo', 'Re, Alessandro', 'Motta, Marina', 'Peli, Annalisa', 'Bianchetti, Nicola', 'Anastasia, Antonella', 'Dalceggio, Daniela', 'Roccaro, Aldo M', 'Tucci, Alessandra', 'Cairoli, Roberto', 'Muiesan, Maria Lorenza', 'Rossi, Giuseppe']","['Cattaneo C', 'Daffini R', 'Pagani C', 'Salvetti M', 'Mancini V', 'Borlenghi E', ""D'Adda M"", 'Oberti M', 'Paini A', 'De Ciuceis C', 'Barbullushi K', 'Cancelli V', 'Belotti A', 'Re A', 'Motta M', 'Peli A', 'Bianchetti N', 'Anastasia A', 'Dalceggio D', 'Roccaro AM', 'Tucci A', 'Cairoli R', 'Muiesan ML', 'Rossi G']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0031-3237', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4666-3817', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0617-3127', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1156-6395']","['Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Internal Medicine, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, A.

Moderate to high doses of radiation are well established causes of cancer, especially for exposure at young ages. However, cancer risk from low-dose medical imaging is debated. OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on cancer risks associated with prenatal and postnatal medical diagnostic ionizing radiation exposure among children and to assess this risk through a meta-analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search of five electronic databases supplemented by a hand search was performed to retrieve relevant epidemiological studies published from 2000 to 2019, including patients younger than 22 years of age exposed to medical imaging ionizing radiation. Pooled odds ratio (ORpooled) and pooled excess relative risk (ERRpooled) representing the excess of risk per unit of organ dose were estimated with a random effect model. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included. For prenatal exposure (radiographs or CT), no significant increased risk was reported for all cancers, leukemia and brain tumors. For postnatal exposure, increased risk was observed only for CT, mostly for leukemia (ERRpooled=26.9 Gy(-1); 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7-57.1) and brain tumors (ERRpooled=9.1 Gy(-1); 95% CI: 5.2-13.1). CONCLUSION: CT exposure in childhood appears to be associated with increased risk of cancer while no significant association was observed with diagnostic radiographs.","['Abalo, Kossi D', 'Rage, Estelle', 'Leuraud, Klervi', 'Richardson, David B', 'Le Pointe, Hubert Ducou', 'Laurier, Dominique', 'Bernier, Marie-Odile']","['Abalo KD', 'Rage E', 'Leuraud K', 'Richardson DB', 'Le Pointe HD', 'Laurier D', 'Bernier MO']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5064-0215'],"['Laboratory of Epidemiology, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, BP 17, 92262, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France. kossi.abalo@irsn.fr.', 'Laboratory of Epidemiology, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, BP 17, 92262, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Laboratory of Epidemiology, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, BP 17, 92262, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Imaging, Hopital d'Enfants Armand-Trousseau APHP, Paris, France."", 'Research Department on Biological and Health Effects of Ionizing Radiation, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.', 'Laboratory of Epidemiology, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, BP 17, 92262, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20200910,Germany,Pediatr Radiol,Pediatric radiology,0365332,,IM,"['*Brain Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radiation Exposure/adverse effects', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Radiography']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Children', '*Computed tomography', '*Ionizing radiation', '*Postnatal', '*Prenatal', '*Radiography', '*Risk']",2020/09/11 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2020/09/10 12:25'],"['2020/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/10 12:25 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00247-020-04803-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00247-020-04803-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Radiol. 2021 Jan;51(1):45-56. doi: 10.1007/s00247-020-04803-0.

Dexamethasone affects child's sleep and behavior. Standard-risk (SR) patients only receive oral chemotherapy, without dexamethasone. Effects of stratified therapy on parents are not well known. This study compares parental sleep, distress and quality of life (QoL) with the general population, between MR and SR groups, and on- and off-dexamethasone (MR group). PROCEDURE: One year after diagnosis, parents of MR patients completed the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) sleep, distress thermometer for parents and Short Form-12 (SF-12) twice; once on-dexamethasone and once off-dexamethasone. SR parents completed one measurement. Sleep problems, distress and QoL scores (off-dexamethasone) were compared to reference values and between MR and SR. Score differences on- and off-dexamethasone were assessed by multilevel regression analysis. RESULTS: Parents (80% mothers) of 121 patients (57% males; 75% MR, 25% SR) completed 191 measurements. Compared to reference values, parents reported more sleep disturbances, higher distress, and lower mental QoL. Additionally, MR parents reported clinical distress (score >/= 4), whereas SR parents (on average) did not (mean 4.8 +/- 2.4 vs 3.5 +/- 2.4, P = .02). Within the MR group, outcomes did not significantly differ on- and off-dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS: Parents of ALL patients report sleep problems, high distress, and QoL impairment. Within the MR group, parental functioning did not differ on- and off-dexamethasone. However, MR parents reported clinical distress more often than SR parents, possibly reflecting differences in prognostic estimates and treatment burden. This perhaps includes the overall strain of cyclic dexamethasone. This study highlights the need for psychosocial support throughout treatment, regardless of risk stratification.","['Rensen, Niki', 'Steur, Lindsay M H', 'Grootenhuis, Martha A', 'van Eijkelenburg, Natasha K A', 'van der Sluis, Inge M', 'Dors, Natasja', 'van den Bos, Cor', 'Tissing, Wim J E', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'van Litsenburg, Raphaele R L']","['Rensen N', 'Steur LMH', 'Grootenhuis MA', 'van Eijkelenburg NKA', 'van der Sluis IM', 'Dors N', 'van den Bos C', 'Tissing WJE', 'Kaspers GJL', 'van Litsenburg RRL']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1683-6331'],"['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', ""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands."", ""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', ""Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus Medical Center, Pediatric Oncology, Rotterdam, Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', ""Amalia Children's Hospital, Radboud University Medical Center, Pediatric Oncology, Nijmegen, Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', ""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Academic Medical Center, Pediatric Oncology, Amsterdam, Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Pediatric Oncology, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', ""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands."", 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Netherlands.', ""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200910,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/*administration & dosage/blood', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', '*Quality of Life', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sleep Wake Disorders/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Stress, Psychological/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*dexamethasone', '*parents', '*psychosocial', '*quality of life', '*sleep']",2020/09/11 06:00,2021/01/20 06:00,['2020/09/10 08:45'],"['2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/10 08:45 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28697 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Nov;67(11):e28697. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28697.

One mechanism is skewed metabolism of 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), a major component of maintenance therapy, which results in preferential formation of the hepatotoxic metabolite (6-methyl mercaptopurine [6MMP]) with low levels of the antileukemic metabolite, 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6TGN). Allopurinol can modify 6MP metabolism to favor 6TGN production and reduce 6MMP. METHODS: Patients in maintenance were considered for allopurinol treatment who had the following features: (a) Grade >/=3 hepatotoxicity; (b) Grade >/=2 nonhepatic gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity; or (c) persistently elevated absolute neutrophil count (ANC) despite >150% protocol dosing of oral chemotherapy. RESULTS: From 2013 to 2017, 13 ALL patients received allopurinol: nine for hepatotoxicity, five for inadequate myelosuppression, and three for nonhepatic GI toxicity (four met multiple criteria). Allopurinol was well tolerated, without significant adverse events. Allopurinol resulted in a significant decrease in the average 6MMP/6TGN ratio (mean reduction 89.1, P = .0001), with a significant increase in 6TGN (mean 550.4, P = .0008) and a significant decrease in 6MMP (mean 13 755, P = .0013). Patients with hepatotoxicity had a significant decrease in transaminase elevation after starting allopurinol (alanine transaminase [ALT] mean decrease 22.1%, P = .02), and all with nonhepatic GI toxicity had improved symptoms. Those with inadequate myelosuppression had a significant increase in the time with ANC in goal (mean increase 26.4%, P = .0004). CONCLUSIONS: Allopurinol during ALL maintenance chemotherapy is a safe, feasible, and effective intervention for those who have altered metabolism of 6MP causing toxicity or inadequate myelosuppression.","['Cohen, Gordon', 'Cooper, Stacy', 'Sison, Edward Allan', 'Annesley, Colleen', 'Bhuiyan, Mariam', 'Brown, Patrick']","['Cohen G', 'Cooper S', 'Sison EA', 'Annesley C', 'Bhuiyan M', 'Brown P']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8507-3732'],"['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', ""Section of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Houston, Texas."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."", 'Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Division of Pediatric Oncology, Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200910,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Allopurinol/*therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*allopurinol', '*leukemia', '*mercaptopurine']",2020/09/11 06:00,2021/01/20 06:00,['2020/09/10 08:44'],"['2019/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/10 08:44 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28360 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Nov;67(11):e28360. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28360.

We evaluated the impact of BMI at diagnosis on the risk of relapse in children with ALL treated according to Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) protocols. METHOD: In a multicenter study, we collected data on BMI at diagnosis and outcome of 2558 children aged 2.0-17.9 years diagnosed between 1992 and 2016. Patients were divided into four groups according to International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) childhood BMI cut-offs: underweight, <17; healthy weight, 17-25; overweight, 25-30; and obese, >/=30 kg/m(2) . RESULTS: In Cox multivariate regression analyses, an increased risk of relapse was observed in children aged 10-17.9 years with unhealthy BMI at diagnosis (underweight hazard ratio HR: 2.90 [95% confidence interval: 1.24-6.78], P = .01; overweight, HR: 1.95 [1.11-3.43], P = .02, and obese HR: 4.32 [95% 2.08-8.97], P < .001), compared to children with healthy weight.

CONCLUSION: High BMI, and especially obesity at diagnosis, is an independent adverse prognostic factor for relapse in older children with ALL.","['Egnell, Christina', 'Ranta, Susanna', 'Banerjee, Joanna', 'Merker, Andrea', 'Niinimaki, Riitta', 'Lund, Bendik', 'Mogensen, Pernille Rudebeck', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Vaitkeviciene, Goda', 'Lepik, Kristi', 'Forslund, Anders', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Harila-Saari, Arja']","['Egnell C', 'Ranta S', 'Banerjee J', 'Merker A', 'Niinimaki R', 'Lund B', 'Mogensen PR', 'Jonsson OG', 'Vaitkeviciene G', 'Lepik K', 'Forslund A', 'Heyman M', 'Harila-Saari A']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1141-9053', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7854-0371', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0190-5664', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5583-741X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2767-5828']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Children and Adolescents Department, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."", 'PEDEGO Research Unit, Medical Research Center Oulu and Department of Children and Adolescents, Oulu University Hospital and University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, St. Olavs University Hospital, and the Department of Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Children's Hospital, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland."", ""Children's Hospital, Affiliate of Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos and Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania."", ""Department of Haematology and Oncology, Tallin Children's Hospital, Tallin, Estonia."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200920,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Obesity/complications', 'Overweight/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology']",PMC7693088,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'body mass index', 'children', 'obesity', 'survival']",2020/09/11 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2020/09/10 08:44'],"['2020/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/10 08:44 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13517 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 Dec;105(6):797-807. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13517.

Through interviews, the researchers identified five categories of experiences among participants, including, ""Death anxiety,"" ""Feeling guilty,"" ""Fulfilling responsibilities as a mom,"" ""Feeling overwhelmed by life,"" and ""Feeling grateful."" In the course of treatment, mothers tended to feel pressured to be a good mother, and sometimes felt overwhelmed by life.

Experiments were done using a mouse model of adenomyosis which took place in a hospital-affiliated laboratory. The mouse model used for this research is ICR mouse. Adenomyosis was induced by oral gavage of tamoxifen (TAM) from postnatal days (PNDs) 1 to 4 in ICR mice. Bilateral intrauterine injection of anti-TGF-beta1-neutralizing antibody or isotype IgG or PBS was performed at PND42. The mice were then either sacrificed or mated at PND64 followed by sacrificing at gestational day (GD) 4 or proceeding to delivery. Implantation numbers, rate of dams with live birth, live birth numbers, survival at 1 week old, and pup mortality rate after weaning were recorded. Collagen was demonstrated by Masson's trichrome and Van Gieson's stains. Uterine expression of a receptivity marker, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), was examined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Anti-TGF-beta1 treatment increased the mean implantation numbers, fecundity rate, the rate of dams with live birth, pup survival rate at 1 week old, and pup mortality rate after weaning. Collagen expression in uteri with adenomyosis was attenuated by anti-TGF-beta1 treatment. Increased LIF expression by anti-TGF-beta1 treatment was detected by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and IHC. The results suggest that inhibition of TGF-beta1 improves pregnancy outcomes by restoring endometrial receptivity in mice with adenomyosis.","['Kay, Nari', 'Huang, Chun-Yen', 'Shiu, Li-Yen', 'Yu, Ya-Chun', 'Chang, Yu', 'Schatz, Frederick', 'Suen, Jau-Ling', 'Tsai, Eing-Mei', 'Huang, S Joseph']","['Kay N', 'Huang CY', 'Shiu LY', 'Yu YC', 'Chang Y', 'Schatz F', 'Suen JL', 'Tsai EM', 'Huang SJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4987-4756'],"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, E-Da Hospital, 6 Yida Rd., Jiaosu Village, Yanchao District, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, #100, Tzyou 1st Road, Kaohsiung, 807, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, College of Medicine, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, E-Da Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, E-Da Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, E-Da Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, E-Da Hospital, 6 Yida Rd., Jiaosu Village, Yanchao District, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, College of Medicine, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, 12901 Bruce B Downs Blvd., MDC48, Tampa, FL, 33612, USA.', 'Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, #100, Tzyou 1st Road, Kaohsiung, 807, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, #100, Tzyou 1st Road, Kaohsiung, 807, Taiwan. tsaieing@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. tsaieing@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, E-Da Hospital, 6 Yida Rd., Jiaosu Village, Yanchao District, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. jhuang3@usf.edu.', 'School of Medicine, College of Medicine, I-Shou University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. jhuang3@usf.edu.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, 12901 Bruce B Downs Blvd., MDC48, Tampa, FL, 33612, USA. jhuang3@usf.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200909,United States,Reprod Sci,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",101291249,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Tgfb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Adenomyosis/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/*pharmacology', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Embryo Implantation/*drug effects', 'Endometrium/*drug effects/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Infertility, Female/etiology/metabolism/physiopathology/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Pregnancy', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adenomyosis', '*Endometrial receptivity', '*Leukemia inhibitory factor', '*Tamoxifen', '*Transforming growth factor-beta1']",2020/09/11 06:00,2021/11/24 06:00,['2020/09/10 05:38'],"['2020/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/10 05:38 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s43032-020-00308-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s43032-020-00308-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Reprod Sci. 2021 Mar;28(3):877-887. doi: 10.1007/s43032-020-00308-1.

Methods: LCL lymphoblast cells and B lymphocytes were subjected to HuR overexpression (OV) or interference (IV). Western blot was used to observe the protein expression of human tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1), human inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase alpha (IKK-alpha), NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK), and p52. Flow cytometry was performed to evaluate apoptosis, and the mRNA expression of TRAF1 was examined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Immunofluorescence was carried out to visualize the expression of HuR, and the relationship between HuR and TRAF1 was observed by pull-down test. Cell sensitivity to chlorambucil (CLB) and fludarabine (Flu) was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8. Results: The expression of HuR and TRAF1 in LCLs was significantly increased compared to that in B lymphocytes. Compared with the control, HuR OV significantly increased the expression of TRAF1 (P < 0.05), whereas it was significantly decreased in the IV group (P < 0.05). HuR can bind to TRAF1 directly, and the binding rate is positively correlated with HuR expression. After inhibiting HuR, the expression of TRAF1, IKK-alpha, NIK, p52, pro-Caspase 3, and PARP was significantly upregulated in LCLs and B lymphocytes (P < 0.05), while Caspase 3 was downregulated (P < 0.05). Compared with the control, the proliferation of LCLs and B lymphocytes treated by CLB and Flu decreased significantly after HuR blockade (P < 0.05). Conclusion: HuR may be a key protein regulating CLL resistance. After inhibiting HuR, inflammatory response and apoptosis were significantly increased, and the cell sensitivity to CLB and Flu increased, suggesting that inhibiting HuR activity may be a potential strategy to solve the problem of drug resistance in CLL cells.","['Xiao, Kai', 'Yang, Lin', 'Gao, Xinfeng', 'An, Ying', 'Xie, Wei', 'Jingquan, Guo']","['Xiao K', 'Yang L', 'Gao X', 'An Y', 'Xie W', 'Jingquan G']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5491-249X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8201-0584']","['Department of Foot & Ankle Surgery, Wuhan Fourth Hospital, Puai Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Allergy, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of HUST, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Orthopedic, Wuhan Fourth Hospital, Puai Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Orthopedic, Wuhan Fourth Hospital, Puai Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Orthopedic, Wuhan Fourth Hospital, Puai Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Orthopedic, Wuhan Fourth Hospital, Puai Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200827,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (ELAV-Like Protein 1)', '0 (ELAVL1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1)', '0 (TNF protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'ELAV-Like Protein 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",PMC7474742,,,2020/09/11 06:00,2021/04/29 06:00,['2020/09/10 05:36'],"['2020/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/10 05:36 [entrez]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/1481572 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2020 Aug 27;2020:1481572. doi: 10.1155/2020/1481572. eCollection 2020.,['Copyright (c) 2020 Kai Xiao et al.'],,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We assessed the effects of decitabine (DEC), a hypomethylating agent, upon allogeneic immune reaction in a murine model of DLI. Results: Significantly greater tumor growth retardation and survival prolongation occurred in mice administered with 1.0 mg/kg DEC for 5 days (DEC-1.0) than in control or DEC-0.1 mice. Upon prompt DEC and DLI co-administration, dendritic cells (DCs) were activated; DEC-1.0/DLI induced severe GVHD, and survival was significantly lower than with DLI alone or DEC-0.1/DLI treatments. IFN-gamma and CD28 levels were higher in splenic DCs of DEC-1.0 mice than in those of control mice. Assessment of delayed DLI co-administration with DEC, when IFN-gamma levels were normalized to control levels, revealed that DEC-1.0/DLI successfully facilitated tumor management without causing severe GVHD. Conclusions: Our results suggest that DEC primes allogeneic immune reactions of DLI via DC activation, and GVHD and GVL effects are separable through optimal DLI timing based on DEC-induced increase in IFN-gamma expression levels.","['Kwon, Yong-Rim', 'Kim, Hye Joung', 'Sohn, Min-Jung', 'Lim, Ji-Young', 'Park, Kyung-Shin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Jeong, Dae-Chul', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin']","['Kwon YR', 'Kim HJ', 'Sohn MJ', 'Lim JY', 'Park KS', 'Lee S', 'Chung NG', 'Jeong DC', 'Min CK', 'Kim YJ']",,"['Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Immunology, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Immunology, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Immunology, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Immunology, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Clinical Pathology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.grid.414966.80000 0004 0647 5752"", 'Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Immunology, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591 Republic of Korea.grid.411947.e0000 0004 0470 4224"", 'Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591 Republic of Korea.grid.411947.e0000 0004 0470 4224"", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.grid.411947.e0000 0004 0470 4224"", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.grid.411947.e0000 0004 0470 4224"", 'Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Immunology, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591 Republic of Korea.grid.411947.e0000 0004 0470 4224"", 'Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Immunology, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 06591 Republic of Korea.grid.411947.e0000 0004 0470 4224""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200903,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,,PMC7470611,['NOTNLM'],"['Decitabine', 'Dendritic cells', 'Donor lymphocyte infusion', 'Graft-versus-host disease', 'Graft-versus-leukemia effect']",2020/09/11 06:00,2020/09/11 06:01,['2020/09/10 05:36'],"['2020/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/10 05:36 [entrez]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-020-00178-y [doi]', '178 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2020 Sep 3;9:22. doi: 10.1186/s40164-020-00178-y. eCollection 2020.,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is characterized by malignant proliferation of immature lymphocytes, and patients usually present with fatigue and bleeding manifestations. Presentation with BMN is an extremely rare finding and only few cases had been reported in the literature. Case Presentation. A 22-year-old male presented with nocturnal lower back ache, pleuritic central chest pain, and fever for two weeks. He was extensively investigated for a cause. His investigations revealed pancytopenia with severe neutropenia. Initial bone marrow aspiration and biopsy did not provide a positive result due to extensive necrosis. However, immunohistochemical analysis of few immature lymphoid cells on repeated BM biopsy showed evidence of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Conclusions: ALL usually presents with fatigue and bleeding manifestations. Presentation with BMN is extremely rare. The diagnosis was extremely challenging as this patient had only occasional atypical cells in the peripheral blood film and the repeat bone marrow (BM) biopsy showed extensive necrosis.","['Ranathunga, I', 'Muthumala, N R', 'Kulathilake, H W C K', 'Weerasinghe, S', 'Shyamali, N L A']","['Ranathunga I', 'Muthumala NR', 'Kulathilake HWCK', 'Weerasinghe S', 'Shyamali NLA']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2188-5309'],"['Professorial Medical Unit, Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Cancer Institute, Maharagama, Colombo, Sri Lanka.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Colombo, Sri Lanka.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200825,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,PMC7468619,,,2020/09/11 06:00,2020/09/11 06:01,['2020/09/10 05:36'],"['2020/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/10 05:36 [entrez]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/8889850 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2020 Aug 25;2020:8889850. doi: 10.1155/2020/8889850. eCollection 2020.,['Copyright (c) 2020 I.

Although different treatments have been proposed in the past, the vast majority do not regenerate lost tissues. In this sense, the use of dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells (DPMSCs) seems to be an alternative for the regeneration of periodontal bone tissue. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in a sample of 22 adults between 55 and 64 years of age with PD, without uncontrolled systemic chronic diseases. Two groups were formed randomly: (i) experimental group (EG) n = 11, with a treatment based on DPMSCs; and a (ii) control group (CG) n = 11, without a treatment of DPMSCs. Every participant underwent clinical and radiological evaluations and measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) by tomography. Saliva samples were taken as well, to determine the total concentration of antioxidants, superoxide dismutase (SOD), lipoperoxides, and interleukins (IL), before and 6 months after treatment. All subjects underwent curettage and periodontal surgery, the EG had a collagen scaffold treated with DPMSCs, while the CG only had the collagen scaffold placed. The EG with DPMSCs showed an increase in the BMD of the alveolar bone with a borderline statistical significance (baseline 638.82 +/- 181.7 vs. posttreatment 781.26 +/- 162.2 HU, p = 0.09). Regarding oxidative stress and inflammation markers, salivary SOD levels were significantly higher in EG (baseline 1.49 +/- 0.96 vs. 2.14 +/- 1.12 U/L posttreatment, p < 0.05) meanwhile IL1beta levels had a decrease (baseline 1001.91 +/- 675.5vs. posttreatment 722.3 +/- 349.4 pg/ml, p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that a DPMSCs treatment based on DPMSCs has both an effect on bone regeneration linked to an increased SOD and decreased levels of IL1beta in aging subjects with PD.","['Hernandez-Monjaraz, Beatriz', 'Santiago-Osorio, Edelmiro', 'Ledesma-Martinez, Edgar', 'Aguiniga-Sanchez, Itzen', 'Sosa-Hernandez, Norma Angelica', 'Mendoza-Nunez, Victor Manuel']","['Hernandez-Monjaraz B', 'Santiago-Osorio E', 'Ledesma-Martinez E', 'Aguiniga-Sanchez I', 'Sosa-Hernandez NA', 'Mendoza-Nunez VM']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9137-3405'],"['Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, 09230 Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Haematopoiesis and Leukaemia Laboratory, Research Unit on Cell Differentiation and Cancer, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, 09230 Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Haematopoiesis and Leukaemia Laboratory, Research Unit on Cell Differentiation and Cancer, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, 09230 Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Haematopoiesis and Leukaemia Laboratory, Research Unit on Cell Differentiation and Cancer, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, 09230 Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Haematopoiesis and Leukaemia Laboratory, Research Unit on Cell Differentiation and Cancer, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, 09230 Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, 09230 Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200818,United States,Stem Cells Int,Stem cells international,101535822,,,,PMC7450326,,,2020/09/11 06:00,2020/09/11 06:01,['2020/09/10 05:35'],"['2020/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/10 05:35 [entrez]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/8890873 [doi]'],epublish,Stem Cells Int. 2020 Aug 18;2020:8890873. doi: 10.1155/2020/8890873. eCollection 2020.,['Copyright (c) 2020 Beatriz Hernandez-Monjaraz et al.'],,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the expression and biological role of BRD9 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood. In this study, BRD9 expression was found to be elevated in HCC through data mining of public databases. Next, we confirmed that the expression of BRD9 was increased in HCC tissues compared with that in adjacent non-tumor tissues. The upregulated level of BRD9 was also observed in HCC cells in comparison to LO2 cells. The increased BRD9 expression was correlated with unfavorable clinicopathological features. A high level of BRD9 predicted a poorer overall survival and disease-free survival of HCC patients. Functionally, BRD9 overexpression facilitated the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of Hep3B cells. Conversely, either BRD9 depletion or pharmacological inhibition of BRD9 resulted in the reduced proliferation and invasiveness of HCCLM3 cells. In addition, the BRD9 knockdown restrained the growth and metastasis of HCCLM3 cells in vivo. Mechanistically, BRD9 positively regulated TUFT1 expression and AKT activation in HCC cells. ChIP-qPCR analysis indicated that BRD9 promoted the binding of P300 acetyltransferase to the TUFT1 promoter and epigenetically regulated TUFT1 expression by increasing H3K27Ac in the promoter. Notably, either TUFT1 knockdown or AKT inhibitor (MK2206) abrogated the promoting effects of BRD9 on the proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT of Hep3B cells. The forced expression of TUFT1 abolished the effects of BRD9 knockdown on the growth and metastasis of HCCLM3 cells. Altogether, these data indicate that BRD9 promotes the growth and metastasis of HCC cells by activating the TUFT1/AKT pathway and may serve as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.","['Dou, Changwei', 'Sun, Liankang', 'Wang, Liang', 'Cheng, Jian', 'Wu, Weiding', 'Zhang, Chengwu', 'Xu, Qiuran', 'Tu, Kangsheng', 'Liu, Jie']","['Dou C', 'Sun L', 'Wang L', 'Cheng J', 'Wu W', 'Zhang C', 'Xu Q', 'Tu K', 'Liu J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0032-1459'],"[""Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery & Minimally Invasive Surgery, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital (People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College), 310014, Hangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710061, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710061, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery & Minimally Invasive Surgery, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital (People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College), 310014, Hangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery & Minimally Invasive Surgery, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital (People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College), 310014, Hangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery & Minimally Invasive Surgery, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital (People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College), 310014, Hangzhou, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Tumor Molecular Diagnosis and Individualized Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital (People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College), 310014, Hangzhou, China. windway626@sina.com."", ""Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, 710061, Xi'an, China. tks0912@foxmail.com."", ""Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery & Minimally Invasive Surgery, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital (People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College), 310014, Hangzhou, China. atianlx1226@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200909,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (BRD9 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",PMC7481201,,,2020/09/11 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/09/10 05:30'],"['2020/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/10 05:30 [entrez]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-02943-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-02943-7 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Sep 9;11(9):730. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-02943-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, much attention has been drawn on minimal residual disease (MRD) that is considered a strong prognostic factor for children with AML. Recent studies from the United States and Europe have shown the prognostic impact of FCM-based MRD detection and it is already used for risk stratification in modern AML protocols. Myeloid leukemia in Down's syndrome (ML-DS) has unique characteristics, and ML-DS children are recently being treated separately from non-DS AML children with less intensive treatment. It has been shown that relapsed and refractory cases of ML-DS are difficult to treat; however, no universal prognostic factor has been found yet. In order to determine accurate methods for identifying a subgroup with poor prognosis, an attempt to analyze the role of MRD had been examined in the JPLSG AML-D11 study.

Studies have reported that mutant CALR forms a homomultimeric complex via intermolecular interaction between novel domains acquired due to a frameshift mutation, gains a high binding affinity for myeloproliferative leukemia protein (MPL), the thrombopoietin receptor, through a presumptive structural change, and acts as an agonist for MPL. In this review, I would like to describe the course of the discovery of this unique molecular mechanism and discuss future scope of research on mutant CALR.","['Araki, Marito']",['Araki M'],,"['Department of Transfusion Medicine and Stem Cell Regulation, Juntendo University.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (CALB2 protein, human)', '0 (Calbindin 2)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Calbindin 2/*genetics', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Calreticulin', 'Janus kinase 2', 'Myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'Thrombopoietin receptor']",2020/09/11 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/09/10 05:29'],"['2020/09/10 05:29 [entrez]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.61.937 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2020;61(8):937-944. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.61.937.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that pre-TCR signalling leads to increased expression of the transcriptional repressor Bcl6 and that Bcl6 is required for differentiation to DP. Conditional deletion of Bcl6 from thymocytes reduced pre-TCR-induced differentiation to DP cells, disrupted expansion and enrichment of intracellular TCRbeta(+) cells within the DN population and increased DN4 cell death. Deletion also increased Notch1 activation and Notch-mediated transcription in the DP population. Thus, Bcl6 is required in thymocyte development for efficient differentiation from DN3 to DP and to attenuate Notch1 activation in DP cells.

Present treatment options are limited and there is no curative therapy for ATL. Ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 is commonly mutated or functionally inactivated in human cancers. Consistent with the notion that FBXW7 controls the degradation of many oncoproteins, loss of FBXW7 has been linked to increased drug resistance or sensitivity in cancer cells. METHOD: In this study, we have characterized FBXW7 mutants previously identified in HTLV-I-infected ATL patient samples. TET-inducible ATL cells carrying wild type or mutated FBXW7 were analyzed for target degradation and for drug sensitivity. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that mutations in FBXW7 can selectively disrupt ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of target proteins: c-MYC, cyclin E and MCL1. Both c-MYC and MYCN were highly expressed in uncultured ATL patient's samples and ATL-derived cell lines; and ATL cells demonstrated sensitivity to BET inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. High-throughput reverse phase protein array revealed BRAF as a novel target of FBXW7 and further experiments showed that mutations in FBXW7 preventing degradation of BRAF provided resistance to BET inhibitors. In contrast to R465, hot spot FBXW7 mutations at R505C retained degradation of BRAF but not NOTCH1, c-MYC, cyclin E, or MCL1. Finally, a combination therapy using BET inhibitors along with a BRAF or an ERK inhibitor prevented tumor cell resistance and growth. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that FBXW7 status may play an important role in drug therapy resistance of cancer cells. Genetic characterization of FBXW7 may be one factor included in future personalized cancer treatment identification.","['Yeh, Chien-Hung', 'Bellon, Marcia', 'Wang, Fang', 'Zhang, Hong', 'Fu, Liwu', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Yeh CH', 'Bellon M', 'Wang F', 'Zhang H', 'Fu L', 'Nicot C']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5927-2869'],"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangdong Esophageal Cancer Institute, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS, 66160, USA. cnicot@kumc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200909,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Azepines/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin E/genetics', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Heterografts', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/drug effects/genetics', 'Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Triazoles/pharmacology']",PMC7487643,,,2020/09/11 06:00,2021/06/12 06:00,['2020/09/10 05:26'],"['2020/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/10 05:26 [entrez]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12943-020-01254-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12943-020-01254-x [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2020 Sep 9;19(1):139. doi: 10.1186/s12943-020-01254-x.,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201309/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shanafelt and colleagues compared the efficacy of ibrutinib-rituximab with that of standard chemoimmunotherapy in patients with treatment-naive CLL. They did not, however, mention that the therapy varies on the basis of where patients live and, given that local guidelines not immediately reflect US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updates, discrepancies in treatment occur. Important CLL goals are the availability of rapidly reproducible tests, standardization of national and international guidelines, and FDA approval-based treatment reimbursement.","['Bravaccini, Sara', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Cerchione, Claudio']","['Bravaccini S', 'Martinelli G', 'Cerchione C']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0075-8538'],"['124882Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola (FC), Emilia-Romagna, Italy.', '124882Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola (FC), Emilia-Romagna, Italy.', '124882Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Meldola (FC), Emilia-Romagna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,"['0 (Piperidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*therapy', 'Piperidines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Rituximab/*therapeutic use']",PMC7784498,['NOTNLM'],"['*chemoimmunotherapy', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*ibrutinib-rituximab']",2020/09/11 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/09/10 05:24'],"['2020/09/10 05:24 [entrez]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/0963689720950209 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Transplant. 2020 Jan-Dec;29:963689720950209. doi: 10.1177/0963689720950209.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is tightly associated with cancer development and progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ADAR1 in the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines after 8-Cl-Ado exposure and its possible mechanisms. After 8-Cl-Ado exposure, CCK-8 assay was performed to determine the cell proliferation; flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle profiles and apoptosis; and the protein levels of ADAR1, p53, p21, and cyclin D1 were measured by western blotting. The results showed that the cell proliferation was greatly inhibited, G1 cell cycle was arrested, and apoptosis was induced after 8-Cl-Ado exposure. ADAR1 and cyclin D1 protein levels were dramatically decreased, while p53 and p21 levels were increased after 8-Cl-Ado exposure. Moreover, the cell growth inhibition was rescued, apoptosis was reduced, and p53 and p21 protein levels were downregulated, while cyclin D1 was upregulated when cells were transfected with plasmids expressing ADAR1 proteins. More importantly, RNA-binding domain of ADAR1 is critical to the cell growth inhibition of breast cancer cells exposed to 8-Cl-Ado. Together, 8-Cl-Ado inhibits the cell proliferation, induces G1 phase arrest and apoptosis at least by targeting ADAR1/p53/p21 signaling pathway. The findings may provide us with insights into the role of ADAR1 in breast cancer progression and help us better understand the effects of 8-Cl-Ado in the treatment of breast cancer.","['Ding, Hong-Yue', 'Yang, Wan-Yong', 'Zhang, Li-Hong', 'Li, Li', 'Xie, Feng', 'Li, Hua-Yi', 'Chen, Xiao-Yu', 'Tu, Zeng', 'Li, Yi', 'Chen, Yong', 'Yang, Sheng-Yong']","['Ding HY', 'Yang WY', 'Zhang LH', 'Li L', 'Xie F', 'Li HY', 'Chen XY', 'Tu Z', 'Li Y', 'Chen Y', 'Yang SY']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7312-0255'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Molecular Medicine and Cancer Research Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Dongguan Waterfront Zone Central Hospital, Dongguan, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Molecular Medicine and Cancer Research Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Molecular Medicine and Cancer Research Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Molecular Medicine and Cancer Research Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Molecular Medicine and Cancer Research Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Molecular Medicine and Cancer Research Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Molecular Medicine and Cancer Research Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Molecular Medicine and Cancer Research Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Radiology and Intervention, The General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Molecular Medicine and Cancer Research Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', 'EC 3.5.4.37 (ADAR protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'PA05MFH3I7 (8-chloroadenosine)']",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Deaminase/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Protein Domains', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC7784596,['NOTNLM'],"['*8-Cl-Ado', '*ADAR1', '*breast cancer cells', '*cell cycle', '*double-stranded RNA-binding domain']",2020/09/11 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/09/10 05:24'],"['2020/09/10 05:24 [entrez]', '2020/09/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/0963689720958656 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Transplant. 2020 Jan-Dec;29:963689720958656. doi: 10.1177/0963689720958656.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further understand the mechanistic basis of interindividual variability in the functional expression of OCTN1 in AML, we hypothesized a mechanistic connection to DNA methylation-based epigenetic repression of SLC22A4. We found increased basal SLC22A4 methylation was associated with decreased Ara-C uptake in AML cell lines. Pre-treatment with hypomethylating agents, 5-azacytidine, or decitabine, restored SLC22A4 mRNA expression, increased cellular uptake of Ara-C, and was associated with increased cellular sensitivity to Ara-C compared with vehicle-treated cells. Additionally, lower SLC22A4 methylation status was associated with distinct clinical advantages in both adult and pediatric patients with AML. These findings suggest a regulatory mechanism is involved in the interindividual variability in response to Ara-C, and provides a basis for the integration of hypomethylating agents into Ara-C-based treatment regimens.","['Buelow, Daelynn R', 'Anderson, Jason T', 'Pounds, Stanley B', 'Shi, Lei', 'Lamba, Jatinder K', 'Hu, Shuiying', 'Gibson, Alice A', 'Goodwin, Emily A', 'Sparreboom, Alex', 'Baker, Sharyn D']","['Buelow DR', 'Anderson JT', 'Pounds SB', 'Shi L', 'Lamba JK', 'Hu S', 'Gibson AA', 'Goodwin EA', 'Sparreboom A', 'Baker SD']",,"['Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy and Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200909,United States,Clin Transl Sci,Clinical and translational science,101474067,"['0 (Organic Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (SLC22A4 protein, human)', '0 (Symporters)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Decitabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Epigenetic Repression/drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Organic Cation Transport Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Symporters/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC7877866,,,2020/09/10 06:00,2021/10/26 06:00,['2020/09/09 18:16'],"['2020/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/09 18:16 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cts.12861 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transl Sci. 2021 Jan;14(1):137-142. doi: 10.1111/cts.12861.

Here, we prospectively compared the outcomes of Haplo-HSCT with MUD-HSCT for AML in remission (n = 110) to prove non-inferiority of overall survival in Haplo-HSCT. Both groups were well balanced in factors related to biological features of AML and measurable residual disease (MRD) status by Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) assay. A unique, reduced-toxicity preparative regimen was used for Haplo-HSCT, whereas mostly-myeloablative regimen was for MUD-HSCT. Both groups showed similar patterns of neutrophil and platelet recovery, whereas delayed T-cell reconstitution in Haplo-HSCT was found compared with MUD-HSCT. No significant differences were found in acute or chronic graft-vs-host-disease (GVHD) and post-transplant infectious events with an exception of EBV or CMV infection, which occurred more frequently in Haplo-HSCT. After a median follow-up of 47 months, no significant differences in overall survival (65% vs 54%, P = .146), disease-free survival (67% vs 53%, P = .142), relapse (20% vs 21%, P = .858), non-relapse mortality (14% vs 26%, P = .103), or GVHD-free/relapse-free survival (54% vs 41%, P = .138) were observed for Haplo-HSCT vs MUD-HSCT. In multivariate analysis, WT1 expression before transplantation independently predicted relapse, resulting in inferior survival. Separate analysis of unenrolled patients (n = 110) who were excluded or refused to participate in this study showed consistent results with enrolled patients. This prospective study demonstrated the non-inferiority of Haplo-HSCT to MUD-HSCT for AML in remission, and validated the role of WT1 quantification as an MRD marker (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier:

Recently, the safety and efficacy of HLA-mismatched allogeneic cord blood-derived CD19 CAR-NK cell therapy for CD19-positive hematological malignancies have been reported. However, the durability of clinical effects has not been clarified. The characteristics of CAR-NK cells with a strong antileukemia/lymphoma effect and better proliferative capacity without severe adverse effects may be promising for overcoming intractable hematological malignancies as an off-the-shelf allogeneic cellular therapy.","['Tanaka, Junji']",['Tanaka J'],['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7026-1455'],"[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200921,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['*Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', '*Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/transplantation', '*Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/immunology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-NK cell', 'NK cell', 'cellular therapy']",2020/09/10 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2020/09/09 18:16'],"['2020/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/09 18:16 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2802 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2021 Feb;39(1):11-19. doi: 10.1002/hon.2802.

As the understanding of the genetic characteristics of Ph-positive ALL continues to improve, the prognostic value of cytogenetic abnormalities is becoming increasingly recognized. It is likely that the clinical guidelines and recommendations will also evolve. Accordingly, it will be very important to effectively and economically utilize current knowledge to guide treatment decisions within the clinical context of each patient.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge is scarce regarding the incidence and risk factors of symptomatic HF in patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: Baseline clinical and echocardiographic parameters, including indices of cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction and myocardial strain [global longitudinal strain; GLS]), were obtained in 450 patients with acute leukemia treated with anthracyclines, before chemotherapy initiation. Potential risk factors for HF were evaluated using Fine and Gray's regression analysis, and from this, a 21-point risk score was generated. RESULTS: Forty patients (8.9%) developed HF. The HF risk score included a baseline GLS >-15% (indicative of greater impairment) (6 points), baseline left ventricular ejection fraction <50%, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, acute myeloid leukemia (4 points each), cumulative anthracycline dose >/=250 mg/m(2) (2 points), and age >60 years (1 point). Patients were stratified into low (score 0 to 6), moderate (score 7 to 13), and high risk (score 14 to 21). The estimated 1-year cumulative incidence of HF for low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups was 1.0%, 13.6%, and 35.0%, respectively (p < 0.001). The HF risk score was also predictive of all-cause mortality (p < 0.001). After adjustment for age and leukemia type, however, only GLS was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 1.73; 95% confidence interval: 1.30 to 2.31; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a baseline risk score to determine risk of HF in patients with acute leukemia. Additional studies are needed to determine the external validity of these findings.","['Kang, Yu', 'Assuncao, Bruna Leal', 'Denduluri, Srinivas', 'McCurdy, Shannon', 'Luger, Selina', 'Lefebvre, Benedicte', 'Carver, Joseph', 'Scherrer-Crosbie, Marielle']","['Kang Y', 'Assuncao BL', 'Denduluri S', 'McCurdy S', 'Luger S', 'Lefebvre B', 'Carver J', 'Scherrer-Crosbie M']",,"['Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, Department of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Departamento de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Sao Paulo-SP, Brazil.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, Department of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology Diseases, Department of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PennSylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology Diseases, Department of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PennSylvania.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, Department of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, Department of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, Department of Medicine, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191217,United States,JACC CardioOncol,JACC.

(2) Evaluation of differentiation capability of the generated ALL_iPSCs into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and comparison with normal iPSCs using the colony-forming unit (CFU) assay. ALL_iPSCs manifested all lineages for hematopoiesis in their colonies similar to normal iPSCs. (3) ALL_iPSCs showed a considerably higher number of burst-forming unit-erythroid colonies indicating the presence of more erythroid progenitors than normal iPSCs; this tendency was confirmed in the CFU assay of ALL_CD34+ cells.

Sporadically, autism spectrum disorders and blue sclerae in infancy have been reported in IDS. Rarely, IDS-affected patients present with epilepsy and/or epileptic syndromes. It has been shown that a haploinsufficiency of the B cell leukaemia/lymphoma 11A gene (BCL11A) is responsible for IDS. Herein, we identified a novel de novo frameshift deletion (c.271delG; p.E91Afs*2) in the BCL11A gene in a boy affected with IDS. Interestingly, this heterozygous loss-of-function BCL11A mutation was also associated with a generalised idiopathic epilepsy and severe language delay observed in the patient. Moreover, our study showed that the combination of molecular genetic analyses with the monitoring of HbF was essential to make the final diagnosis of Dias-Logan syndrome.

Therefore, we focus on the downstream signals of CXCR4 that contribute to T-ALL cell migration in this study. Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI2) is expressed preferentially in lymphocytes. It interacts with and regulates the activation of Rho proteins by inhibiting the dissociation of GDP and the binding of GTP. In a previous study, we demonstrated that RhoA and RhoC are activated and required for CXCR4-mediated JURKAT cell migration. In the present work, we investigate the role of RhoGDI2 in CXCR4-mediated T-ALL cell migration. Results show that RhoGDI2 sh2 significantly releases its inhibition effects on T-ALL cell migration toward CXCL12 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12). Phosphorylation of RhoGDI2 on Y24 and Y153 releases RhoA and RhoC from RhoGDI2, which recovers CXCR4-mediated migration toward CXCL12 although the phosphorylation of Y130 has less effect on RhoA or RhoC binding. Furthermore, Src is activated by CXCL12. Transfection of siRNAs to Src reduces CXCR4-mediated migration. Src is required for the phosphorylation of RhoGDI2 on Y153, and ABL1 is activated by CXCL12 and responsible for the phosphorylation of RhoGDI2 on Y24 and Y130. Similarly, knockdown of the expression of ABL1 by siRNAs reduces the CXCR4-mediated migration. Therefore, RhoGDI2 may be a brake for CXCR4-positive T-ALL migration. Because migration is a prerequisite for infiltration of leukemia, this work may suggest the possible involvement of RhoGDI2 in infiltration of T-ALL.","['Luo, Jixian', 'Wang, Junting', 'Zheng, Huiguang', 'Wang, Lan']","['Luo J', 'Wang J', 'Zheng H', 'Wang L']",,"['School of Life Sciences, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200807,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7438871,['NOTNLM'],"['RhoGTPases', 'chemokines', 'leukemia', 'migration', 'receptor']",2020/09/10 06:00,2020/09/10 06:01,['2020/09/09 17:57'],"['2020/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/09 17:57 [entrez]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.01512 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Aug 7;10:1512. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01512. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Luo, Wang, Zheng and Wang.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) is a rare hematological malignancy having elevated levels of eosinophils and characterized by the presence of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene. In this study, we examined the pro-apoptotic mechanisms of S100A8 and S100A9 in FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha+ eosinophilic cells and hypereosinophilic patient cells. S100A8 and S100A9 induce apoptosis of the FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha+ EoL-1 cells via TLR4. The surface TLR4 expression increased after exposure to S100A8 and S100A9 although total TLR4 expression decreased. S100A8 and S100A9 suppressed the FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha-mediated signaling pathway by downregulating FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha mRNA and protein expression and triggered cell apoptosis by regulating caspase 9/3 pathway and Bcl family proteins. S100A8 and S100A9 also induced apoptosis of imatinib-resistant EoL-1 cells (EoL-1-IR). S100A8 and S100A9 blocked tumor progression of xenografted EoL-1 and EoL-1-IR cells in NOD-SCID mice and evoked apoptosis of eosinophils derived from hypereosinophilic syndrome as well as chronic eosinophilic leukemia.

Here, we show that high miR-155-5p levels are associated with unfavorable prognostic factors in two independent breast cancer cohorts (CSS cohort, n = 283; and TCGA-BRCA dataset, n = 1,095). Consistently, miR-155-5p results as differentially expressed in the breast cancer subgroups identified by the surrogate molecular classification in the CSS cohort and the PAM50 classifier in TCGA-BRCA dataset, with the TNBC and HER2-amplified tumors carrying the highest levels. Since the analysis of TCGA-BC dataset also demonstrated a significant association between miR-155-5p levels and the presence of mutations in homologous recombination (HR) genes, we hypothesized that miR-155-5p might affect cell response to the PARP-1 inhibitor Olaparib. As expected, miR-155-5p ectopic overexpression followed by Olaparib administration resulted in a greater reduction of cell viability as compared to Olaparib administration alone, suggesting that miR-155-5p might induce a synthetic lethal effect in cancer cells when coupled with PARP-1-inhibition. Overall, our data point to a role of miR-155-5p in homologous recombination deficiency and suggest miR-155-5p might be useful in predicting response to PARP1 inhibitors in the clinical setting.","['Pasculli, Barbara', 'Barbano, Raffaela', 'Fontana, Andrea', 'Biagini, Tommaso', 'Di Viesti, Maria Pia', 'Rendina, Michelina', 'Valori, Vanna Maria', 'Morritti, Maria', 'Bravaccini, Sara', 'Ravaioli, Sara', 'Maiello, Evaristo', 'Graziano, Paolo', 'Murgo, Roberto', 'Copetti, Massimiliano', 'Mazza, Tommaso', 'Fazio, Vito Michele', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Parrella, Paola']","['Pasculli B', 'Barbano R', 'Fontana A', 'Biagini T', 'Di Viesti MP', 'Rendina M', 'Valori VM', 'Morritti M', 'Bravaccini S', 'Ravaioli S', 'Maiello E', 'Graziano P', 'Murgo R', 'Copetti M', 'Mazza T', 'Fazio VM', 'Esteller M', 'Parrella P']",,"['Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, Laboratorio di Oncologia, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, Laboratorio di Oncologia, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, UO di Biostatistica, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, Laboratory of Bioinformatics Unit, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, Laboratorio di Oncologia, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, Laboratorio di Oncologia, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, UO di Oncologia, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, UO di Oncologia, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Biosciences Laboratory, Meldola, Italy.', 'Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS, Biosciences Laboratory, Meldola, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, UO di Oncologia, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, UO di Anatomia Patologica, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, UO di Chirurgia Senologica, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, UO di Biostatistica, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, Laboratory of Bioinformatics Unit, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, Laboratorio di Oncologia, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo Della Sofferenza, Laboratorio di Oncologia, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200812,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC7435065,['NOTNLM'],"['Olaparib', 'PARP-1 inhibitors', 'breast cancer', 'homologous recombination', 'hsa-miR-155-5p']",2020/09/10 06:00,2020/09/10 06:01,['2020/09/09 17:55'],"['2020/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/09 17:55 [entrez]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.01415 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Aug 12;10:1415. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01415. eCollection 2020.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Pasculli, Barbano, Fontana, Biagini, Di Viesti, Rendina,', 'Valori, Morritti, Bravaccini, Ravaioli, Maiello, Graziano, Murgo, Copetti, Mazza,', 'Fazio, Esteller and Parrella.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first therapeutic agents approved by regulatory authorities for MF, these drugs attenuate the overactive JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling universally present in these patients, translating into major clinical benefits in terms of spleen shrinkage and symptom improvement. These, in turn, confer a survival advantage on patients with advanced disease, demonstrated in the case of ruxolitinib, for which long-term follow-up data are available. However, JAK inhibitors do not improve cytopenias in most patients, have relatively modest effects on bone marrow fibrosis and driver mutation allele burden, and clinical resistance eventually develops. Furthermore, they do not modify the risk of transformation to blast phase; indeed, their mechanism of action may be more anti-inflammatory than truly disease-modifying. This has spurred interest in rational combinations of JAK inhibitors with other agents that may improve cytopenias and drugs that could potentially modify the natural history of MF. Newer JAK inhibitors that are distinguished from ruxolitinib and fedratinib by their ability to improve anemia (eg, momelotinib) or safety and efficacy in severely thrombocytopenic patients (eg, pacritinib) are in phase 3 clinical trials. There is also interest in developing inhibitors that are highly selective for mutant JAK2, as well as ""type II"" JAK2 inhibitors. Overall, although current JAK inhibitors have limitations, they will likely continue to form the backbone of MF therapy for the foreseeable future.","['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Bose P', 'Verstovsek S']",,"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200721,United States,Hemasphere,HemaSphere,101740619,,,,PMC7375176,,,2020/09/10 06:00,2020/09/10 06:01,['2020/09/09 17:53'],"['2020/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/09 17:53 [entrez]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1097/HS9.0000000000000424 [doi]', 'HemaSphere-2020-0111 [pii]']",epublish,Hemasphere. 2020 Jul 21;4(4):e424. doi: 10.1097/HS9.0000000000000424. eCollection 2020 Aug.,"['Copyright (c) 2020 the Author(s).

Specifically, using pull-down and saturation binding experiments, we show that IFI16 binds with high affinity to the lipid A moiety of LPS. Remarkably, IFI16 DAMP activity is potentiated upon binding to subtoxic concentrations of strong TLR4-activating LPS variants, as judged by TLR4-MD2/TIRAP/MyD88-dependent IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha transcriptional activation and release in stimulated monocytes and renal cells. Consistently, using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) approaches, we show that IFI16 is a specific TLR4-ligand and that IFI16/LPS complexes display a faster stimulation turnover on TLR4 than LPS alone.

Many studies in pediatric and adult populations have validated the prognostic significance of MRD early in and throughout the course of treatment for ALL, and it is generally accepted that achievement of MRD less than 10[-4] (0.01%) is a critical milestone. ALL is uniquely amenable to quantification of MRD by multiple techniques, including multiparameter flow cytometry, various allele-specific and mutation-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods, and more recently amplicon-based next-generation sequencing. Quantification of MRD with these high-sensitivity methods not only facilitates risk stratification, but also is used to determine appropriateness of intensified therapy, such as allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant, as well as MRD-targeted therapy with blinatumomab. We review the data supporting the use of MRD quantification in ALL to guide clinical decision-making.","['Akabane, Hugo', 'Logan, Aaron']","['Akabane H', 'Logan A']",,"['UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco.', 'UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of California, San Francisco.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,,IM,"['Adult', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*therapy']",,,,2020/09/10 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2020/09/09 17:52'],"['2020/09/09 17:52 [entrez]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2020 Jul;18(7):413-422.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically, the continuously slow intravenous infusion is adopted to maintain effective blood concentration and reduce toxic effects, but it causes poor patient' compliance for a considerable infusion period. To overcome these disadvantages, we developed an oral ATO sustained-release preparation which was constructed via the ATO core pellets prepared by extrusion spheronization and followed by a coating membrane by fluid-bed technology. The prepared coated pellets displayed a round surface and uniform particle size. All in vitro release profiles of ATO pellets in different pH media and rotation speeds had no statistical difference. Importantly, the coated pellets can release completely in 12 h without obvious burst release. There was no distinct change in appearance and release behaviors in stability experiments. In vivo pharmacokinetics was studied by one-time intragastric administration of rats. Compared with free drug, the AUC0-infinity of the ATO coated pellets was 2.3-fold higher, indicating the oral bioavailability was significantly increased. Cmax decreased by about a half and Tmax extended about 15 h. In particularly, the ATO level at 96 h only decreased about 20% of Cmax , suggesting that the ATO sustained-release preparation could not only decrease the peak concentration, but also maintain a relatively constant blood concentration for a long period. Further, the in vivo absorption could be well predicted by in vitro release experiments. Therefore, the ATO sustained-release preparation formulated by the mature preparation technology, possessing satisfactory stability and improving bioavailability, had great application potentials for industrialization.","['Liu, Xiao', 'Zhou, Ping', 'Yang, Yueying', 'Liu, Jingxuan', 'Widjaya, Andy Samuel', 'Jiang, Yanyan']","['Liu X', 'Zhou P', 'Yang Y', 'Liu J', 'Widjaya AS', 'Jiang Y']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Smart Drug Delivery, Ministry of Education, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Haerbin Yida Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Haerbin, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Smart Drug Delivery, Ministry of Education, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Smart Drug Delivery, Ministry of Education, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Smart Drug Delivery, Ministry of Education, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Smart Drug Delivery, Ministry of Education, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200916,England,Drug Dev Ind Pharm,Drug development and industrial pharmacy,7802620,"['0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Drug Implants)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Arsenic Trioxide', 'Biological Availability', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', '*Drug Implants', 'Rats', 'Solubility']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Arsenic trioxide', 'compliance', 'oral bioavailability', 'pellets', 'sustained-release', 'toxicity']",2020/09/10 06:00,2021/03/26 06:00,['2020/09/09 17:45'],"['2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/09 17:45 [entrez]']",['10.1080/03639045.2020.1821050 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Dev Ind Pharm. 2020 Nov;46(11):1809-1818. doi: 10.1080/03639045.2020.1821050.

Concomitant DIC is associated with the severity of the underlying disease and poor prognosis. The Japanese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis released the new DIC diagnostic criteria in 2017. This criteria include coagulation markers such as soluble fibrin and the thrombin-antithrombin complex to more accurately evaluate the hypercoagulable state in patients. Among several groups of anticoagulants available, recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin is most frequently used to treat DIC caused by haematological malignancies in Japan. DIC is remitted in parallel with the improvement of the underlying haematological diseases; thus, there is room for debate regarding whether the treatment of DIC would improve the prognosis of patients. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation as well as the recently introduced chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy are innovative therapies to produce a cure in a subset of patients with haematological malignancies. However, coagulopathy frequently occurs after these therapies, which limits the success of the treatment. For example, DIC is noted in approximately 50% of patients after CAT-T-cell therapy in conjunction with cytokine release syndrome. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) causes endotheliitis, which triggers coagulopathy and the development of potentially lethal complications, such as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease and transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy. This review article describes the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, and treatment of DIC caused by haematological malignancies, CAR-T-cell therapy, and HSCT.","['Ikezoe, Takayuki']",['Ikezoe T'],['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7858-278X'],"['Department of Haematology, Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima, 960-1295, Japan. ikezoet@fmu.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200909,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)', '0 (antithrombin III-protease complex)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', '9001-31-4 (Fibrin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Antithrombin III/analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis/blood', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/diagnosis/*etiology/*therapy', 'Fibrin/analysis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/etiology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects', 'Peptide Hydrolases/analysis', '*Receptors, Chimeric Antigen', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Solubility', 'Thrombomodulin/*therapeutic use', 'Thrombotic Microangiopathies/etiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'Cytokine release syndrome', 'DIC', 'Haematological malignancies', 'TA-TMA', 'VOD/SOS']",2020/09/10 06:00,2021/02/12 06:00,['2020/09/09 12:33'],"['2020/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/09 12:33 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-02992-w [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-02992-w [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2021 Jan;113(1):34-44. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-02992-w.

To broaden the clinical impact of checkpoint targeting, we devised a strategy that couples targeting of the cytokine-inducible Src homology 2-containing (CIS) protein, a key negative regulator of interleukin 15 (IL-15) signaling, with fourth-generation ""armored"" chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) engineering of cord blood-derived natural killer (NK) cells. This combined strategy boosted NK cell effector function through enhancing the Akt/mTORC1 axis and c-MYC signaling, resulting in increased aerobic glycolysis. When tested in a lymphoma mouse model, this combined approach improved NK cell antitumor activity more than either alteration alone, eradicating lymphoma xenografts without signs of any measurable toxicity. We conclude that targeting a cytokine checkpoint further enhances the antitumor activity of IL-15-secreting armored CAR-NK cells by promoting their metabolic fitness and antitumor activity. This combined approach represents a promising milestone in the development of the next generation of NK cells for cancer immunotherapy.","['Daher, May', 'Basar, Rafet', 'Gokdemir, Elif', 'Baran,

Breast, ovarian, bladder, and skin cancers have been demonstrated to be suppressed by retinoic acid, as well. The bottom-up proteomic strategies were applied for the analysis of proteins extracted from triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells utilizing a commercially manufactured kit. The gel electrophoresis followed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis was used for protein determination. By employing PDQuest software, we identified several proteins affected by all-trans retinoic acid.

PR/SET domain 16 (PRDM16) transcript levels were assessed in 267 consecutive adult ICR-AML patients at diagnosis by real-time quantitative PCR. 38.2% patients had PRDM16 transcript levels higher than the upper limit of normal bone marrow samples. Through ROC curve analysis and comparison of relapse-free survival (RFS), the optimal cutoff value of PRDM16 transcript levels was identified to group patients into high expression (PRDM16-H, 21.3%) and low expression (PRDM16-L). PRDM16-H was significantly associated with lower 4-year RFS and overall survival (OS) rates in the entire cohort, patients with normal karyotypes, FLT3-ITD (-) and NPM1 mutation (+)/FLT3-ITD (-) patients (all p < .05). Multivariate analysis showed that PRDM16-H was an independent adverse prognostic factor for RFS and OS in the entire cohort.

This study examined whether in vitro proliferation and maintenance of cockerel spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) could be improved by adding different combinations of growth factors (GFs), including glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) into the culture medium. 2. The SSCs were isolated from the testes of immature cockerels. For short-term cultures, a medium supplemented with different combinations of GFs for 7 d in 5 replicates was used. The groups were classified as follows: without GF (control group); with GDNF (G group); with GDNF and bFGF (GF group); and with GDNF, bFGF and LIF (GFL group). The number of colonies and cells per colony, as well as the transcript abundance of STRA8 and OCT4 genes, was determined 7 d after the initial culturing. Immunofluorescence staining of SSEA-1, SSEA-3 and VASA protein markers, besides periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, was carried out. 3. The number of colonies and cells per colony increased in the G, GF and GFL groups, compared to the control group (P < 0.01); however, the highest proliferation and colony formation were observed in the GFL group. The positive immunofluorescence staining of SSEA-1, SSEA-3 and VASA protein markers, as well as PAS staining, confirmed the self-renewal and colonisation of cockerel SSCs. The proliferation results were supported by the increased STRA8 and OCT4 transcript abundance in the treated groups (G, GF and GLF), compared to the control group. The SSC proliferation was associated with the higher transcript abundance of STAR8 and OCT4 genes in the GFL group, compared to the G and GF groups (P < 0.01). 4. The results showed that proliferation and colony-forming capacity of cockerel SSCs were positively improved by GDNF, bFGF and LIF. However, the most significant effect was observed when the medium was supplemented with LIF in combination with GDNF and bFGF.","['Rasouli-Gharehsaghal, K', 'Shakeri, M', 'Zhandi, M', 'Amini, H R', 'Yousefi, A R', 'Asadirad, M']","['Rasouli-Gharehsaghal K', 'Shakeri M', 'Zhandi M', 'Amini HR', 'Yousefi AR', 'Asadirad M']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2886-9747'],"['Department of Animal Science, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran , Karaj, Iran.', 'Department of Animal Science, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran , Karaj, Iran.', 'Department of Animal Science, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran , Karaj, Iran.', 'Department of Animal Science, College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran , Karaj, Iran.', 'Transgenesis Center of Excellence, Isfahan (Khorasgan) Branch, Islamic Azad University , Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology and Experimental Animals, Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organisation (AREEO) , Karaj, Iran.', 'Department of Animal and Poultry Science, College of Aburaihan, University of Tehran , Pakdasht, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200925,England,Br Poult Sci,British poultry science,15740290R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chickens', 'Male', '*Spermatogonia', 'Stem Cells', 'Testis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Growth factor', 'immunofluorescence', 'proliferation', 'rooster', 'spermatogonia']",2020/09/10 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/09/09 12:23'],"['2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/09 12:23 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00071668.2020.1808187 [doi]'],ppublish,Br Poult Sci. 2020 Dec;61(6):660-668. doi: 10.1080/00071668.2020.1808187.

METHODS: Following stimulation with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) or methylation inhibitor for three days, we evaluated changes in the DNMT1 expression levels, cell proliferation activity, and Bcl-2-Associated X Protein (BAX) expression levels in the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 and the acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. RESULTS: DNMT1 expression levels and cell proliferation activity decreased in K562 and THP-1 cells, whereas BAX expression levels increased. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the enzymatic activity of DNMT1 promotes the proliferation of tumor cells and that tumor cell proliferation can be suppressed by inhibiting DNMT1 enzymatic activity. Furthermore, because DNA methylation is associated with apoptosis, a process critical to cell growth and injury in leukemia, assessing DNMT1expression levels might help in treatment decisions for leukemia patients.","['Kanda, Tomoyuki', 'Nanmoku, Toru', 'Oki, Keiko', 'Kawakami, Yasushi']","['Kanda T', 'Nanmoku T', 'Oki K', 'Kawakami Y']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,['EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)'],IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics']",,,,2020/09/10 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/09/09 11:57'],"['2020/09/09 11:57 [entrez]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200125 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2020 Sep 1;66(9). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2020.200125.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bone marrow and peripheral blood from patients with B acute lymphoblastic leukemia were analyzed for complete blood counts, bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic abnormalities. The study group was divided into smaller groups based on cytogenetic abnormalities. Hematological parameters and presence of recurrent genetic abnormalities was compared across age groups and gender by non parametric tests. RESULTS: BCR-ABL positive group had a higher leukocyte count than BCR-ABL negative group. Among groups 1 to 5, group 1 with gains of chromosomes was associated with leucopenia and higher age at presentation. BCR-ABL is commonest recurrent abnormality followed by IgH rearrangements.

Casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha), encoded by CSNK1A1, regulates Wnt/betacatenin, p53 and other key signaling pathways, and is critically involved in tumor progression. However, the relationship and mechanism of CK1alpha with autophagy in AML still remain unclear. In the present study, it was found that AML patients had higher expression of CSNK1A1 mRNA than healthy donors. Furthermore, we analyzed 163 cases of AML patients in the LAML database of TCGA and found that AML patients with high CSNK1A1 had shorter overall survival than those with low or medium CSNK1A1 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CK1alpha was a negative regulator of autophagy and apoptosis. Pharmacologic inhibition of CK1alpha using D4476 or CK1alpha knockdown via lentivirusmediated shRNA suppressed proliferation and the clone formation by enhancing autophagic flux and apoptosis in AML cell lines as well as in patient blast cells. Intriguingly, D4476induced cell death was aggravated in combination with an autophagy inhibitor, Spautin1, suggesting that autophagy may be a prosurvival signaling. CK1alpha interacted with murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and p53, and CK1alpha inhibitor D4476 significantly upregulated p53 and phosphorylated 5' AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK), and substantially inhibited the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Our findings indicate that CK1alpha promotes AML by suppressing p53 downstream of MDM2mediated autophagy and apoptosis, suggesting that targeting CK1alpha provides a therapeutic opportunity to treat AML.","['Xu, Wanling', 'Huang, Ziyang', 'Gan, Yifeng', 'Chen, Rongrong', 'Huang, Yisha', 'Xue, Bin', 'Jiang, Songfu', 'Yu, Zhijie', 'Yu, Kang', 'Zhang, Shenghui']","['Xu W', 'Huang Z', 'Gan Y', 'Chen R', 'Huang Y', 'Xue B', 'Jiang S', 'Yu Z', 'Yu K', 'Zhang S']",,"['Department of Hematology, Wenzhou Key Laboratory of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325015, P.R.

Increasing evidence has confirmed that the elevated capacity for DNA damage repair in cancer cells is a major mechanism of acquired chemotherapeutic resistance. Thus, combining chemotherapy with inhibitors of DNA damage repair pathways is potentially an ideal strategy for treating leukemia. Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is an important component of the DNA damage response (DDR) and is involved in the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint. In the present study, we demonstrated that shRNAmediated CHK1 silencing suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced the cytotoxic effects of etoposide (VP16) in the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line K562 through the results of CCK8, and comet assay. The results demonstrated that shRNAinduced CHK1 silencing can override G2/M arrest and impair homologous recombination (HR) repair by reducing breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) expression. Cells had no time, and thus limited ability, to repair the damage and were thus more sensitive to chemotherapy after CHK1 downregulation. Second, we tested the therapeutic effect of VP16 combined with CCT245737, an orally bioavailable CHK1 inhibitor, and observed strong synergistic anticancer effects in K562 cells. Moreover, we discovered that CCT245737 significantly prevented the G2/M arrest caused by acute exposure to VP16. Interestingly, CCT245737 inhibited both BRCA1 and Rad51, the most important component of the HR repair pathway. In conclusion, these results revealed that CHK1 is potentially an ideal therapeutic target for the treatment of CML and that CCT245737 should be considered a candidate drug.","['Fan, Zhuoyi', 'Luo, Huacheng', 'Zhou, Jie', 'Wang, Fangce', 'Zhang, Wenjun', 'Wang, Jian', 'Li, Shuo', 'Lai, Qian', 'Xu, Yueshuang', 'Wang, Guangming', 'Liang, Aibin', 'Xu, Jun']","['Fan Z', 'Luo H', 'Zhou J', 'Wang F', 'Zhang W', 'Wang J', 'Li S', 'Lai Q', 'Xu Y', 'Wang G', 'Liang A', 'Xu J']",,"['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200065, P.R.

However, large research studies designed to investigate factors contributing to cancer aetiology and progression have mainly focused on populations of European origin. The limitations in clinicopathological and genetic data, as well as the reduced availability of biospecimens from diverse populations, contribute to the knowledge gap and have the potential to widen cancer health disparities. In this review, we summarise reported disparities and associated factors in the United States of America (USA) for the most common cancers (breast, prostate, lung and colon), and for a subset of other cancers that highlight the complexity of disparities (gastric, liver, pancreas and leukaemia). We focus on populations commonly identified and referred to as racial/ethnic minorities in the USA-African Americans/Blacks, American Indians and Alaska Natives, Asians, Native Hawaiians/other Pacific Islanders and Hispanics/Latinos. We conclude that even though substantial progress has been made in understanding the factors underlying cancer health disparities, marked inequities persist. Additional efforts are needed to include participants from diverse populations in the research of cancer aetiology, biology and treatment. Furthermore, to eliminate cancer health disparities, it will be necessary to facilitate access to, and utilisation of, health services to all individuals, and to address structural inequities, including racism, that disproportionally affect racial/ethnic minorities in the USA.","['Zavala, Valentina A', 'Bracci, Paige M', 'Carethers, John M', 'Carvajal-Carmona, Luis', 'Coggins, Nicole B', 'Cruz-Correa, Marcia R', 'Davis, Melissa', 'de Smith, Adam J', 'Dutil, Julie', 'Figueiredo, Jane C', 'Fox, Rena', 'Graves, Kristi D', 'Gomez, Scarlett Lin', 'Llera, Andrea', 'Neuhausen, Susan L', 'Newman, Lisa', 'Nguyen, Tung', 'Palmer, Julie R', 'Palmer, Nynikka R', 'Perez-Stable, Eliseo J', 'Piawah, Sorbarikor', 'Rodriquez, Erik J', 'Sanabria-Salas, Maria Carolina', 'Schmit, Stephanie L', 'Serrano-Gomez, Silvia J', 'Stern, Mariana C', 'Weitzel, Jeffrey', 'Yang, Jun J', 'Zabaleta, Jovanny', 'Ziv, Elad', 'Fejerman, Laura']","['Zavala VA', 'Bracci PM', 'Carethers JM', 'Carvajal-Carmona L', 'Coggins NB', 'Cruz-Correa MR', 'Davis M', 'de Smith AJ', 'Dutil J', 'Figueiredo JC', 'Fox R', 'Graves KD', 'Gomez SL', 'Llera A', 'Neuhausen SL', 'Newman L', 'Nguyen T', 'Palmer JR', 'Palmer NR', 'Perez-Stable EJ', 'Piawah S', 'Rodriquez EJ', 'Sanabria-Salas MC', 'Schmit SL', 'Serrano-Gomez SJ', 'Stern MC', 'Weitzel J', 'Yang JJ', 'Zabaleta J', 'Ziv E', 'Fejerman L']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7129-2918', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0770-9659', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3179-1151']","['Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine and Human Genetics, and Rogel Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'University of California Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California Davis, Sacramento, CA, USA.', 'Genome Center, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA.', 'Genome Center, University of California Davis, Davis, CA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center, San Juan, Puerto Rico.', 'Division of Breast Surgery, Department of Surgery, NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Genetic Epidemiology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Cancer Biology Division, Ponce Research Institute, Ponce Health Sciences University, Ponce, Puerto Rico.', 'Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Laboratorio de Terapia Molecular y Celular, IIBBA, Fundacion Instituto Leloir, CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Department of Population Sciences, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Division of Breast Surgery, Department of Surgery, NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Interdisciplinary Breast Program, New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Slone Epidemiology Center at Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Office of the Director, National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Subdireccion de Investigaciones - Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia de Colombia, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Department of Cancer Epidemiology, H.

In gastric cancer, it had been reported to be downregulated. However, the clinical significance and underlying mechanism of PART1 function in gastric cancer remains undefined. Here, seven differential expression levels of noncoding RNAs (DE-lncRNAs) were screened from gastric cancer through a probe reannotation of a human exon array. PART1 was selected for further study because of its high fold change number. In our cohort, PART1 was identified as a significant downregulated lncRNA in gastric cancer tissues by qPCR and in situ hybridization (ISH), and its low expression was significantly correlated with postoperative metastasis and short overall survival time after surgery. Through the results of gain-of-function experiments, PART1 was confirmed as a tumor suppressor that can decrease not only cell viability, migration, and invasion in vitro but also tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, RNA pull-down and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) showed that PART1 interacts with androgen receptor (AR), and then, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) is upregulated in an androgen-independent manner. In a chain reaction, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay additionally illustrated that PLZF upregulation increased the enrichment of EZH2 and H3K27 trimethylation in the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFB) promotor, thereby inhibition of PDGFB and the subsequent PDGFRbeta/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Based on these findings, we showed PART1 plays a tumor suppressor role by promoting PLZF expression followed by recruitment of EZH2 to mediate epigenetic PDGFB silencing and downstream PI3K/Akt inhibition, suggesting that PART1 has a key role in restraining the aggressive ability of GC cells and providing a novel perspective on lncRNAs in GC progression.","['Han, H', 'Wang, S', 'Meng, J', 'Lyu, G', 'Ding, G', 'Hu, Y', 'Wang, L', 'Wu, L', 'Yang, W', 'Lv, Y', 'Jia, S', 'Zhang, L', 'Ji, J']","['Han H', 'Wang S', 'Meng J', 'Lyu G', 'Ding G', 'Hu Y', 'Wang L', 'Wu L', 'Yang W', 'Lv Y', 'Jia S', 'Zhang L', 'Ji J']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2240-5546', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6330-8032', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4776-5898', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6688-0408', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9464-0233', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6878-5543']","['Department of Biobank, Key laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing, P.R.

Forkhead box A2 (FOXA2) is expressed specifically in the glands of the uterus and a critical regulator of glandular epithelium (GE) differentiation, development, and function. Mice with a conditional deletion of FOXA2 in the adult uterus, created using the lactotransferrin iCre (Ltf-iCre) model, have a morphologically normal uterus with glands, but lack FOXA2-dependent GE-expressed genes, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Adult FOXA2 conditional knockout (cKO; Ltf (iCre/+) Foxa2 (f/f) ) mice are infertile due to defective embryo implantation arising from a lack of LIF, a critical implantation factor of uterine gland origin. However, intraperitoneal injections of LIF can initiate embryo implantation in the uterus of adult FOXA2 cKO mice with pregnancies maintained to term. Here, we tested the hypothesis that FOXA2-regulated genes in the uterine glands impact development of the decidua, placenta, and fetus. On gestational day 8.5, the antimesometrial and mesometrial decidua transcriptome was noticeably altered in LIF-replaced FOXA2 cKO mice. Viable fetuses were reduced in FOXA2 cKO mice on gestational days 12.5 and 17.5. Sex-dependent differences in fetal weight, placenta histoarchitecture, and the placenta and metrial gland transcriptome were observed between control and FOXA2 cKO mice. The transcriptome of the placenta with a female fetus was considerably more altered than the placenta with a male fetus in FOXA2 cKO dams. These studies reveal previously unrecognized sexually dimorphic effects of FOXA2 and uterine glands on fetoplacental development with potential impacts on offspring health into adulthood.","['Dhakal, Pramod', 'Kelleher, Andrew M', 'Behura, Susanta K', 'Spencer, Thomas E']","['Dhakal P', 'Kelleher AM', 'Behura SK', 'Spencer TE']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1057-2435', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2815-766X']","['Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211.', 'Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211.', 'Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211.', 'Institute for Data Science and Informatics, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211.', 'Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211; spencerte@missouri.edu.', ""Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Women's Health, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65201.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200908,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Foxa2 protein, mouse)', '135845-92-0 (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Decidua/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetus/*metabolism', '*Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', '*Sex Characteristics', 'Transcriptome/genetics', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",PMC7519319,['NOTNLM'],"['*FOXA2', '*gland', '*placenta', '*pregnancy', '*uterus']",2020/09/10 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/09/09 05:26'],"['2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/09 05:26 [entrez]']","['2014272117 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.2014272117 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Sep 22;117(38):23952-23959. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2014272117.

However, the high manufacturing cost of CAR-T cell therapies poses a major barrier to their broader clinical application. Among the key cost drivers of CAR-T production are single-use reagents for T cell activation and clinical-grade viral vector. The presence of variable amounts of contaminating monocytes in the starting material poses an additional challenge to CAR-T manufacturing, since they can impede T cell stimulation and transduction, resulting in manufacturing failure. METHODS: We created K562-based artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC) with genetically encoded T cell stimulation and costimulation that represent an inexhaustible source for T cell activation. We additionally disrupted endogenous expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on these aAPC (aAPC-DeltaLDLR) using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing nucleases to prevent inadvertent lentiviral transduction and avoid the sink effect on viral vector during transduction. Using various T cell sources, we produced CD19-directed CAR-T cells via aAPC-DeltaLDLR-based activation and tested their in vitro and in vivo antitumor potency against B cell malignancies. RESULTS: We found that lack of LDLR expression on our aAPC-DeltaLDLR conferred resistance to lentiviral transduction during CAR-T production. Using aAPC-DeltaLDLR, we achieved efficient expansion of CAR-T cells even from unpurified starting material like peripheral blood mononuclear cells or unmanipulated leukapheresis product, containing substantial proportions of monocytes. CD19-directed CAR-T cells that we produced via aAPC-DeltaLDLR-based expansion demonstrated potent antitumor responses in preclinical models of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B-cell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our aAPC-DeltaLDLR represent an attractive approach for manufacturing of lentivirally transduced T cells that may be simpler and more cost efficient than currently available methods.","['Schmidts, Andrea', 'Marsh, Leah C', 'Srivastava, Ambike A', 'Bouffard, Amanda A', 'Boroughs, Angela C', 'Scarfo, Irene', 'Larson, Rebecca C', 'Bedoya, Felipe', 'Choi, Bryan D', 'Frigault, Matthew J', 'Bailey, Stefanie R', 'Leick, Mark B', 'Vatsa, Sonika', 'Kann, Michael C', 'Prew, Michelle S', 'Kleinstiver, Benjamin P', 'Joung, J Keith', 'Maus, Marcela V']","['Schmidts A', 'Marsh LC', 'Srivastava AA', 'Bouffard AA', 'Boroughs AC', 'Scarfo I', 'Larson RC', 'Bedoya F', 'Choi BD', 'Frigault MJ', 'Bailey SR', 'Leick MB', 'Vatsa S', 'Kann MC', 'Prew MS', 'Kleinstiver BP', 'Joung JK', 'Maus MV']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7035-1584', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5545-3248', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0174-061X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3111-0221', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5469-0655', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7578-0393']","['Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program and Department of Neurosurgery, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine and Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cellular Immunotherapy Program, Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA mvmaus@mgh.harvard.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,,IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods']",PMC7477986,['NOTNLM'],"['*antigen presentation', '*immunotherapy, adoptive', '*receptors, chimeric antigen']",2020/09/10 06:00,2021/10/15 06:00,['2020/09/09 05:25'],"['2020/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/09 05:25 [entrez]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jitc-2020-000990 [pii]', '10.1136/jitc-2020-000990 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2020 Sep;8(2). pii: jitc-2020-000990. doi: 10.1136/jitc-2020-000990.,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Following allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), antibiotic-induced gut microbiome alterations are associated with risk of relapse and mortality. These findings suggest that the gut microbiota can modulate antitumour immune response across tumour types, though it is not clear if the impact on outcomes is specific to immune therapy. An important limitation of previous studies is that the analysis combined all antibiotic exposures irrespective of the antibiotic spectrum of activity. Whether antibiotic exposure during induction chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) affects risk of relapse is also unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a single-centred retrospective analysis of antibiotic exposures in metastatic/advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell cancer (RCC) receiving ICI and newly diagnosed AML patients receiving induction chemotherapy achieving a complete remission 1. Antibiotic use within 4 weeks before and 6 weeks after the ICI initiation were included. In AML patients, antibiotic exposures between days 1 and 28 of induction were collected. Antibiotics were a priori stratified based on spectrum of activity. Primary outcomes of interest were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) in NSCLC and RCC and relapse-free survival (RFS) in AML. RESULTS: 140 patients with NSCLC, 55 with RCC and 143 with AML were included. In multivariable analysis, PFS and OS were shorter in NSCLC patients who received broad-spectrum anti-anaerobes (PFS, HR=3.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 6.2, p<0.01; OS, HR=1.7, 95% CI 0.8 to 3.6, p=0.19) or 'other' antibiotics (vancomycin-predominant) (PFS, HR=2.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.6, p<0.01; OS, HR=2.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7, p=0.01). In RCC, patients who received penicillins/penicillin-class/early-generation cephalosporins had shorter PFS (HR=3.6, 95% CI 1.7 to 7.6, p<0.01) but similar OS (p=0.37). In the AML cohort, none of the exposures were associated with RFS. CONCLUSION: In contrast to AML, antibiotic exposures in solid tumours affected clinical outcomes. The presence of an allogeneic effect (allo-HCT) or an augmented immune system (checkpoint blockade) may be necessary for microbiota mediation of relapse risk.","['Kulkarni, Amit A', 'Ebadi, Maryam', 'Zhang, Shijia', 'Meybodi, Mohamad A', 'Ali, Alaa M', 'DeFor, Todd', 'Shanley, Ryan', 'Weisdorf, Daniel', 'Ryan, Charles', 'Vasu, Sumithira', 'Rashidi, Armin', 'Patel, Manish Ramesh']","['Kulkarni AA', 'Ebadi M', 'Zhang S', 'Meybodi MA', 'Ali AM', 'DeFor T', 'Shanley R', 'Weisdorf D', 'Ryan C', 'Vasu S', 'Rashidi A', 'Patel MR']",,"['Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Biostatistics Core, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Biostatistics Core, Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.

Acriflavine (ACF) is an FDA approved molecule that has been extensively studied since 1912 with antiseptic, trypanocidal, anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-cancer effects. ACF has been shown to block the growth of solid and hematopoietic tumor cells. Indeed, ACF acts as an inhibitor of various proteins, including DNA-dependent protein kinases C (DNA-PKcs), topoisomerase I and II, hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha), in addition to its recent discovery as an inhibitor of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the expression of the constitutively active tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL. This protein allows the activation of several signaling pathways known for their role in cell proliferation and survival, such as the JAK/STAT pathway. CML therapy, based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib (IM), is highly effective. However, 15% of patients are refractory to IM, where in some cases, 20-30% of patients become resistant. Thus, we suggest the repurposing of ACF in CML after IM failure or in combination with IM to improve the anti-tumor effects of IM. In this review, we present the different pharmacological properties of ACF along with its anti-leukemic effects in the hope of its repurposing in CML therapy.","['Nehme, Rawan', 'Hallal, Rawan', 'El Dor, Maya', 'Kobeissy, Firas', 'Gouilleux, Fabrice', 'Mazurier, Frederic', 'Zibara, Kazem']","['Nehme R', 'Hallal R', 'El Dor M', 'Kobeissy F', 'Gouilleux F', 'Mazurier F', 'Zibara K']",,"['Universite de Tours, EA7501 GICC, Tours, France.', 'Universite de Tours, EA7501 GICC, Tours, France.', 'Universite de Tours, EA7501 GICC, Tours, France.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Universite de Tours, EA7501 GICC, Tours, France.', 'Universite de Tours, EA7501 GICC, Tours, France.', 'PRASE, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '1T3A50395T (Acriflavine)']",IM,"['*Acriflavine', 'Apoptosis', 'Drug Repositioning', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ACF', 'Acriflavine', 'anti-leukemic', 'anti-tumoral', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'drug repurposing', 'leukemia']",2020/09/10 06:00,2021/05/22 06:00,['2020/09/09 05:21'],"['2020/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/09 05:21 [entrez]']","['CMC-EPUB-109782 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867327666200908114411 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2021;28(11):2218-2233. doi: 10.2174/0929867327666200908114411.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is increasing evidence that the individual risk of early relapse can be predicted based on the initial treatment response. However, it is unclear how such a correlation is linked to functional aspects of AML progression and treatment. We suggest a mathematical model in which leukaemia-initiating cells and normal/healthy haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells reversibly change between an active state characterized by proliferation and chemosensitivity and a quiescent state, in which the cells do not divide, but are also insensitive to chemotherapy. Applying this model to 275 molecular time courses of nucleophosmin 1-mutated patients, we conclude that the differential chemosensitivity of the leukaemia-initiating cells together with the cells' intrinsic proliferative capacity is sufficient to reproduce both, early relapse as well as long-lasting remission. We can, furthermore, show that the model parameters associated with individual chemosensitivity and proliferative advantage of the leukaemic cells are closely linked to the patients' time to relapse, while a reliable prediction based on early response only is not possible based on the currently available data. Although we demonstrate with our approach, that the complete response data is sufficient to quantify the aggressiveness of the disease, further investigations are necessary to study how an intensive early sampling strategy may prospectively improve risk assessment and help to optimize individual treatments.","['Hoffmann, H', 'Thiede, C', 'Glauche, I', 'Bornhaeuser, M', 'Roeder, I']","['Hoffmann H', 'Thiede C', 'Glauche I', 'Bornhaeuser M', 'Roeder I']",,"['Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Polyclinic I, University Hospital Dresden Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic and Polyclinic I, University Hospital Dresden Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Partner Site Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Partner Site Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200909,England,J R Soc Interface,"Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",101217269,,IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Models, Theoretical', '*Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment']",PMC7536048,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*leukaemia', '*mathematical modelling', '*measurable residual disease', '*relapse prediction', '*risk stratification']",2020/09/10 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/09/09 05:20'],"['2020/09/09 05:20 [entrez]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1098/rsif.2020.0091 [doi]'],ppublish,J R Soc Interface. 2020 Sep;17(170):20200091. doi: 10.1098/rsif.2020.0091.

All-trans retinoic acid (atRA), one of the first molecularly targeted drugs in oncology, has greatly improved the outcome of a subtype of AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). In contrast, atRA has so far provided little therapeutic benefit in the much larger group of patients with non-APL AML. Attempts to identify genetically or molecularly defined subgroups of patients that may respond to atRA have not yielded consistent results. Since AML is a stem cell-driven disease, understanding the effectiveness of atRA may require an appreciation of its impact on AML stem cells. Recent studies reported that atRA decreased stemness of AML with an FLT3-ITD mutation, yet increased it in AML1-ETO driven or EVI1-overexpressing AML. This review summarizes the role of atRA in normal hematopoiesis and in AML, focusing on its impact on AML stem cells.","['Nguyen, Chi H', 'Grandits, Alexander M', 'Purton, Louise E', 'Sill, Heinz', 'Wieser, Rotraud']","['Nguyen CH', 'Grandits AM', 'Purton LE', 'Sill H', 'Wieser R']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4125-224X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9929-1861', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6593-3168', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0993-4371', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4384-6658']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna , Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center , Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna , Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center , Vienna, Austria.', ""Stem Cell Regulation Unit, St. Vincent's Institute of Medical Research and Department of Medicine at St. Vincent's Hospital, The University of Melbourne , Melbourne, Australia."", 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz , Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna , Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center , Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200908,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",PMC7644151,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*FLT3', '*MECOM', '*atRA', '*hematopoietic stem cell', '*leukemia stem cell']",2020/09/10 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/09/09 05:20'],"['2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/09 05:20 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384101.2020.1810402 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2020 Oct;19(20):2573-2588. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2020.1810402.

Transcription of PARP1 is governed by the proliferation status of cells at each step of their development. Higher abundance of PARP1 in embryonic stem cells and in hematopoietic precursors supports their self-renewal and pluri-/multipotency, whereas a low level of the enzyme in monocytes determines the pattern of surface receptors and signal transducers that are functionally linked to the NFkappaB pathway. In macrophages, the involvement of PARP1 in regulation of transcription, signaling, inflammasome activity, metabolism, and redox balance supports macrophage polarization towards the pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1), which drives host defense against pathogens. On the other hand, it seems to limit the development of a variety of subsets of anti-inflammatory myeloid effectors (M2), which help to remove tissue debris and achieve healing. PARP inhibitors, which prevent protein ADP-ribosylation, and PARP1DNA traps, which capture the enzyme on chromatin, may allow us to modulate immune responses and the development of particular cell types. They can be also effective in the treatment of monocytic leukemia and other cancers by reverting the anti- to the proinflammatory phenotype in tumor-associated macrophages.","['Sobczak, Maciej', 'Zyma, Marharyta', 'Robaszkiewicz, Agnieszka']","['Sobczak M', 'Zyma M', 'Robaszkiewicz A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6265-5585'],"['Department of General Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Immunopathology, Medical University of Lodz, 7/9 Zeligowskiego, Bldg 2, Rm177, 90-752 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of General Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200906,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors/*metabolism']",PMC7565932,['NOTNLM'],"['*differentiation', '*macrophages', '*polarization', '*poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1)', '*stem cells']",2020/09/10 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/09/09 01:05'],"['2020/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/09 01:05 [entrez]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9092040 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9092040 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Sep 6;9(9). pii: cells9092040. doi: 10.3390/cells9092040.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it remains important to identify new agents for the management of this disease. Withanolides, a group of steroidal lactones found in Solanaceae plants are of potential interest due to their reported anticancer activities in different settings. In this study we investigated the anti-proliferative effects and mode of action of Solanaceae-derived withanolides in AML cell models; these metabolites include withametelin (WTH) and Coagulansin A (CoA) isolated from Datura innoxia and Withania coagluanse, respectively. Both withanolides inhibited the proliferation of AML cells and induced cell death, with WTH being more potent than CoA in the AML models tested. Quantitative label-free proteomics and phosphoproteomics were employed to define the mechanism of action of the studied withanolides. We identified and quantified 5269 proteins and 17,482 phosphosites in cells treated with WTH, CoA or vehicle control. Withanolides modulated the expression of proteins involved in regulating key cellular processes including cell cycle, metabolism, signaling, protein degradation and gene expression. Enrichment analysis of the phosphoproteomics data against kinase substrates, kinase-kinase relationships and canonical pathways showed that the withanolides decreased the activity of kinases such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (PKB; also known as RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase or AKT), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and the serine/threonine-protein kinase A-Raf (ARAF), while increasing the activation of DNA repair kinases. These results indicate that withanolide metabolites have pleiotropic effects in the modulation of oncogenic pro-survival and pro-apoptotic signaling pathways that regulate the induction of apoptosis. Withanolide mediated apoptosis was confirmed by immunoblotting showing increased expression of cleaved PARP and Caspases 3, 8 and 9 as a result of treatment. Overall, our results suggest that WTH and CoA have therapeutic potential against AML with WTH exhibiting more potent effects and should be explored further.","['Akhtar, Nosheen', 'Baig, Muhammad Waleed', 'Haq, Ihsan-Ul', 'Rajeeve, Vinothini', 'Cutillas, Pedro Rodriguez']","['Akhtar N', 'Baig MW', 'Haq IU', 'Rajeeve V', 'Cutillas PR']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3426-2274'],"['Cell Signalling and Proteomics Group, Centre of Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Medical Sciences, Rawalpindi 46000, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan.', 'Cell Signalling and Proteomics Group, Centre of Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.', 'Cell Signalling and Proteomics Group, Centre of Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200906,Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,,,,PMC7555989,['NOTNLM'],"['MAPK pathway', 'PI3K pathway', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'coagulansin A', 'proteomics', 'withametelin']",2020/09/10 06:00,2020/09/10 06:01,['2020/09/09 01:05'],"['2020/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/09 01:05 [entrez]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/10 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines8090333 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines8090333 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2020 Sep 6;8(9). pii: biomedicines8090333. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines8090333.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients and Methods: Aims of this study were to evaluate the proportion of de novo chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) patients who achieved a sustained DMR and to identify predictive factors of DMR and molecular recurrence-free survival (MRFS) after TKI discontinuation. Results: Over a period of 10 years, 398 CP-CML patients treated with first-line TKIs were included. Median age at diagnosis was 61 years, 291 (73%) and 107 (27%) patients were treated with frontline imatinib (IMA) or second- or third-generation TKIs (2-3G TKI), respectively. With a median follow-up of seven years (range, 0.6 to 13.8 years), 182 (46%) patients achieved a sustained DMR at least 24 months. Gender, BCR-ABL1 transcript type, and Sokal and ELTS risk scores were significantly associated with a higher probability of sustained DMR while TKI first-line (IMA vs. 2-3G TKI) was not. We estimate that 28% of CML-CP would have been an optimal candidate for TKI discontinuation according to recent recommendations. Finally, 95 (24%) patients have entered in a TFR program. MRFS rates at 12 and 48 months were 55.1% (95% CI, 44.3% to 65.9%) and 46.9% (95% CI, 34.9% to 58.9%), respectively. In multivariate analyses, first-line 2-3G TKIs compared to IMA and TKI duration were the most significant factors of MRFS. Conclusions: Our results suggest that frontline TKIs have a significant impact on TFR in patients who fulfill the selection criteria for TKI discontinuation.","['Etienne, Gabriel', 'Dulucq,

Evidence from in vitro cultures permitted us to choose example cytokines that bind to different biochemical receptor types. Activated malignant B cells or stromal fibroblasts and macrophages prominently secrete the chemokines CCL3 or CXCL12 and CXCL13, respectively. Apart from helper T cells, various cell types of the B cell lymphoma microenvironment are capable of producing the cytokines IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and TNFalpha. Owing to its impact on the development of myeloid cells, CSF-1 is among important soluble factors in the B cell lymphoma microenvironment. Inhibitors of B cell receptor-associated kinases often act via the blockade of cytokine production, but also prevent cytokine effects, e.g., chemotaxis. Increments in blood levels in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients compared to healthy donors and normalization upon treatment with ibrutinib can be explained by producing cell types and modulation of cytokine production observed in vitro.","['Krause, Gunter', 'Hassenruck, Floyd', 'Hallek, Michael']","['Krause G', 'Hassenruck F', 'Hallek M']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3905-0921', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4772-5220']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, 50937 Koln, Germany.', 'Cologne Cluster of Excellence on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-associated Diseases (CECAD Cologne), Joseph-Stelzmann-Str. 26, 50931 Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, 50937 Koln, Germany.', 'Cologne Cluster of Excellence on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-associated Diseases (CECAD Cologne), Joseph-Stelzmann-Str. 26, 50931 Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Kerpener Str. 62, 50937 Koln, Germany.', 'Cologne Cluster of Excellence on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-associated Diseases (CECAD Cologne), Joseph-Stelzmann-Str. 26, 50931 Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200905,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC7564074,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell receptor', 'B cell receptor-associated kinases', 'BTK', 'PI3K', 'T cells', 'chemokines', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'ibrutinib', 'idelalisib', 'lymphoma-associated macrophages']",2020/09/10 06:00,2020/09/10 06:01,['2020/09/09 01:03'],"['2020/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/09 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/10 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12092525 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12092525 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Sep 5;12(9). pii: cancers12092525. doi: 10.3390/cancers12092525.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) found in the bone marrow ensure hematopoietic homeostasis in an organism. Failure of this complex process, which involves a fine balance of self-renewal and differentiation fates, often result in severe hematological conditions such as leukemia and lymphoma. Several molecular and metabolic programs, internal or in close interaction with the bone marrow niche, have been identified as important regulators of HSPC function. More recently, nutrient sensing pathways have emerged as important modulators of HSC homing, dormancy, and function in the bone marrow. Here we describe a method for reliable measurement of various amino acids and minerals in different rare bone marrow (BM) populations, namely HSPCs. We found that the amino acid profile of the most primitive hematopoietic compartments (KLS) did not differ significantly from the one of their direct progenies (common myeloid progenitor CMP), while granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), on the opposite of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), have higher content of the majority of amino acids analyzed. Additionally, we identified intermediates of the urea cycle to be differentially expressed in the KLS population and were found to lower mitochondrial membrane potential, an established readout on self-renewal capability. Moreover, we were able to profile for the first time 12 different minerals and detect differences in elemental contents between different HSPC compartments. Importantly, essential dietary trace elements, such as iron and molybdenum, were found to be enriched in granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs). We envision this amino acid and mineral profiling will allow identification of novel metabolic and nutrient sensing pathways important in HSPC fate regulation.","['Girotra, Mukul', 'Monnard, Caroline', 'Konz, Tobias', 'Sizzano, Federico', 'Goulet, Laurence', 'Godin, Jean-Philippe', 'Coukos, George', 'Rezzi, Serge', 'Vannini, Nicola']","['Girotra M', 'Monnard C', 'Konz T', 'Sizzano F', 'Goulet L', 'Godin JP', 'Coukos G', 'Rezzi S', 'Vannini N']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0937-3674'],"['Department of Oncology, Ludwig Cancer Institute, University of Lausanne, 1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.', 'Nestle Research, EPFL Innovation Park, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Nestle Research, EPFL Innovation Park, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Nestle Research, EPFL Innovation Park, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Nestle Research, EPFL Innovation Park, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Nestle Research, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, 1000 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Oncology, Ludwig Cancer Institute, University of Lausanne, 1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.', 'Nestle Research, EPFL Innovation Park, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Oncology, Ludwig Cancer Institute, University of Lausanne, 1066 Epalinges, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200903,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Minerals)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/*analysis', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Minerals/*analysis']",PMC7504538,['NOTNLM'],"['amino acids', 'hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells', 'minerals', 'mitochondria', 'urea cycle']",2020/09/10 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/09/09 01:03'],"['2020/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/09/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/09 01:03 [entrez]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21176444 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21176444 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Sep 3;21(17). pii: ijms21176444. doi: 10.3390/ijms21176444.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nilotinib therapy at high doses is associated with elevated serum bilirubin levels. If the serum bilirubin level exceeds 3 times the upper limit of normal, the recommendation is to either adjust nilotinib dosage or temporarily discontinue the treatment. However, it is unclear whether hyperbilirubinemia indicates obvious liver histology damage. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 24-year-old man with confirmed CML was treated with nilotinib therapy and developed hyperbilirubinemia after the treatment. Although the first remission of the hyperbilirubinemia was achieved after dose adjustment, the hematological parameters deteriorated. Thus, we initiated an antineoplastic therapy (at the standard dose) until complete remission of the CML was achieved. The pathogenic mechanism of hyperbilirubinemia may be related to the inhibition of uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) activity. Liver histological analysis revealed no significant liver damage. In addition, the patient had no family history of hyperbilirubinemia and liver disease. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was admitted to our hospital under the diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia, and histopathology by liver biopsy showed no obvious damage. We also detected a UGT1A1 mutation [ex1 c.686C > A (p.Pro229Gln)] in the patient and his mother. INTERVENTIONS: When the nilotinib dose was decreased to 300 mg daily, the total bilirubin (TBIL) level decreased to 30 to 50 mumol/L for 1 month. However, because the Bcr-Abl/Abl ratio did not correspond to the major molecular response (MMR; <0.1%), the nilotinib dose was readjusted to 400 mg daily. One week later, the TBIL and indirect bilirubin levels increased to 89 and 79 mumol/L, respectively. The levels of alanine transaminase and other liver functional indicators were normal. OUTCOMES: A Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Probability Scale score of 13 indicates that hyperbilirubinemia is attributed to ADR caused by nilotinib rather than by drug-induced liver injury. CONCLUSION: Although reducing the nilotinib dose can alleviate the occurrence of hyperbilirubinemia, the effect of MMR is also reduced. Treatment of CML without dose adjustment or discontinuation of nilotinib therapy may be more advantageous.","['Tan, Youwen', 'Ye, Yun', 'Zhou, Xingbei']","['Tan Y', 'Ye Y', 'Zhou X']",,,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (UGT1A1 enzyme)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (Glucuronosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury, Chronic/*diagnosis/pathology', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hyperbilirubinemia/chemically induced', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mothers', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",PMC7478446,,,2020/09/10 06:00,2020/09/20 06:00,['2020/09/09 01:02'],"['2020/09/09 01:02 [entrez]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000022061 [doi]', '00005792-202009040-00084 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Sep 4;99(36):e22061. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000022061.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using whole-exome sequencing of a pair of monozygotic twins who were discordant for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with ETV6-RUNX1 (E/R) gene fusion successively after birth, we identified the R209C mutation of G protein subunit alpha o1 (GNAO1) as a new ALL risk loci. Moreover, GNAO1 missense mutations are recurrent in ALL patients and are associated with E/R fusion. Ectopic expression of the GNAO1 R209C mutant increased its GTPase activity and promoted cell proliferation and cell neoplastic transformation. Combined with the E/R fusion, the GNAO1 R209C mutation promoted leukemogenesis through activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. Reciprocally, activated mTORC1 phosphorylated p300 acetyltransferase, which acetylated E/R and thereby enhanced the E/R transcriptional activity of GNAO1 R209C. Thus, our study provides clinical evidence of the functional cooperation of GNAO1 mutations and E/R fusion, suggesting GNAO1 as a therapeutic target in human leukemia.","['Song, Lili', 'Yu, Bo', 'Yang, Yi', 'Liang, Jianwei', 'Zhang, Yingwen', 'Ding, Lixia', 'Wang, Tianyi', 'Wan, Xinyu', 'Yang, Xiaomin', 'Tang, Jingyan', 'Wang, Shengyue', 'Li, Benshang', 'Li, Yanxin', 'Feng, Haizhong']","['Song L', 'Yu B', 'Yang Y', 'Liang J', 'Zhang Y', 'Ding L', 'Wang T', 'Wan X', 'Yang X', 'Tang J', 'Wang S', 'Li B', 'Li Y', 'Feng H']",,"[""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ministry of Health, State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'State Key Laboratory of Oncogenes and Related Genes, Renji-Med X Clinical Stem Cell Research Center, Ren Ji Hospital, Shanghai Cancer Institute, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China;

Cytotoxicity is mediated via signaling through the T-cell receptor (TCR). There is now much interest in combining blinatumomab with targeted therapies, particularly in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL (Ph+ ALL). However, some second- and third-generation ABL inhibitors also potently inhibit Src family kinases that are important in TCR signaling. We combined ABL inhibitors and dual Src/ABL inhibitors with blinatumomab in vitro from both healthy donor samples and primary samples from patients with Ph+ ALL. Blinatumomab alone led to both T-cell proliferation and elimination of target CD19+ cells and enhanced production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). The addition of the ABL inhibitors imatinib or nilotinib to blinatumomab did not inhibit T-cell proliferation or IFN-gamma production. However, the addition of dasatinib or ponatinib inhibited T-cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production. Importantly, there was no loss of CD19+ cells treated with blinatumomab plus dasatinib or ponatinib in healthy samples or samples with a resistant ABL T315I mutation by dasatinib in combination with blinatumomab.

However, its long-term complications or risk of developing diabetes are not available. METHODS: Two hundred patients with lymphoid hematologic malignancy were recruited and followed up for median of 47 months. The underlying hematologic malignancy includes Hodgkin's disease (HD), Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia(CLL), Multiple Myeloma (MM) and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL). Fasting blood sugar, glucose tolerance test and lipid profiles were measured before each chemotherapy cycle and every 3 months after. This study was designed to evaluate patients for long-term follow up of glucose tests abnormalities. RESULTS: The mean age of the non-diabetic patients was significantly lower than that of diabetics and patients with fasting glucose disorder (p < 0.001). The prevalence of diabetes and impaired FBS and GTT was higher in NHL (9%), CLL (6.5%) and MM (1.5%), respectively. For lipid profiles, the highest levels of cholesterol and triglycerides were observed in multiple myeloma and the lowest in Hodgkin's lymphoma (P:0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The most important factor for steroid-induced diabetes is age, which was more prevalent with age increase (P < 0.001). Glucocorticoid-induced diabetes is common in multiple myeloma and then in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in comparison with Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Dehghani, Mehdi', 'Hobbi, Ali Mohammad', 'Haghighat, Shirin', 'Fariba Karimi', 'Ramzi, Mani', 'Vojdani, Reza', 'Karimi, Mojtaba']","['Dehghani M', 'Hobbi AM', 'Haghighat S', 'Fariba Karimi', 'Ramzi M', 'Vojdani R', 'Karimi M']",,"['Hematology Research Center, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.

We investigated the binding and volumetric properties of DB1976, a model bis(benzimidazole)-selenophene diamidine compound with emerging therapeutic potential in acute myeloid leukemia, debilitating fibroses, and obesity-related liver dysfunction. To sample the scope of cognate DB1976 target sites, we evaluated three dodecameric duplexes spanning >10(3)-fold in binding affinity. The attendant changes in partial molar volumes varied substantially, but not in step with binding affinity, suggesting distinct modes of interactions in these complexes. Specifically, whereas optimal binding was associated with loss of hydration water, low-affinity binding released more hydration water. Explicit-atom molecular dynamics simulations showed that minor groove binding perturbed the conformational dynamics and hydration at the termini and interior of the DNA in a sequence-dependent manner. The impact of these distinct local dynamics on hydration was experimentally validated by domain-specific interrogation of hydration with salt, which probed the charged axial surfaces of oligomeric DNA preferentially over the uncharged termini. Minor groove recognition by DB1976, therefore, generates dynamically distinct domains that can make favorable contributions to hydration release in both high- and low-affinity binding. Because ligand binding at internal sites of DNA oligomers modulates dynamics at the termini, the results suggest both short- and long-range dynamic effects along the DNA target that can influence their effectiveness as low-MW competitors of protein binding.","['Ha, Van L T', 'Erlitzki, Noa', 'Farahat, Abdelbasset A', 'Kumar, Arvind', 'Boykin, David W', 'Poon, Gregory M K']","['Ha VLT', 'Erlitzki N', 'Farahat AA', 'Kumar A', 'Boykin DW', 'Poon GMK']",,"['Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia; Department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, California Northstate University, Elk Grove, California.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia; Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia.

Its clinical implications for the patient and the biological mechanism behind the manifestation of LC are unknown. The oncology community is increasingly utilizing mutations to classify a number of malignancies to prognosticate outcomes and to choose targeted therapies. A single-center, retrospective analysis of dermatopathology cases with a diagnosis of leukemia cutis was performed. Patients with genetic testing using the Columbia Combined Cancer Panel (a targeted sequencing protocol of 467 genes) or Genoptix (targeted sequencing protocol of 44 genes) were identified. The frequency of the presence of genetic mutations in LC patients was compared to AML patients from the COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database. Twenty nine cases were confirmed to have leukemia cutis, 22 of which had acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Genetic testing was available in 11 patients. Twelve different mutations were observed with particular enrichment for NPM1 and FLT3-TKD. Our original hypothesis was that patients with LC would display a distinct mutation profile. Ultimately, the distribution of mutations observed in our cohort of LC patients largely reflects the mutational profile seen in AML patients in general.","['Karagounis, Theodora K', 'Rotemberg, Veronica', 'Geskin, Larisa J', 'Jurcic, Joseph G', 'MDAuthors, George Niedt']","['Karagounis TK', 'Rotemberg V', 'Geskin LJ', 'Jurcic JG', 'MDAuthors GN']",,"['Department of Dermatology, New York University Langone Health, New York, NY. theodora.karagounis@nyulangone.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200715,United States,Dermatol Online J,Dermatology online journal,9610776,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,,2020/09/09 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/09/08 19:38'],"['2020/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/08 19:38 [entrez]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Dermatol Online J. 2020 Jul 15;26(7).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our purpose is to evaluate the anti-leukemia effects of Baicalein on CBF-AML and clarify its underlying mechanism. METHODS: Enzyme activity assay was used to measure the activity inhibition of HDACs. Rhodamine123 and RT-qPCR were employed to evaluate the distribution of drugs and the change of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes. CCK8, Annexin V/PI, and FACS staining certified the effects of Baicalein on cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation. Duolink and IP assay assessed the interaction between HDAC-1 and ubiquitin, HSP90 and AML1-ETO, and Ac-p53 and CBFbeta-MYH11. AML cell lines and primary AML cells-bearing NOD/SCID mice models were used to evaluate the anti-leukemic efficiency and potential mechanism of Baicalein in vivo. RESULTS: Baicalein showed HDAC-1/8 inhibition to trigger growth suppression and differentiation induction of AML cell lines and primary AML cells. Although the inhibitory action on HDAC-1 was mild, Baicalein could induce the degradation of HDAC-1 via ubiquitin proteasome pathway, thereby upregulating the acetylation of Histone H3 without promoting ABC transporter genes expression. Meanwhile, Baicalein increased the acetylation of HSP90 and lessened its connection to AML1/ETO, consequently leading to degradation of AML1-ETO in t(8;21)q(22;22) AML cells. In inv(16) AML cells, Baicalein possessed the capacity of apoptosis induction accompanied with p53-mediated apoptosis genes expression. Moreover, CBFbeta-MYH11-bound p53 acetylation was restored via HDAC-8 inhibition induced by Baicalein contributing the diminishing of survival of CD34(+) inv(16) AML cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings improved the understanding of the epigenetic regulation of Baicalein, and warrant therapeutic potential of Baicalein for CBF-AML.","['Yu, Xiaoxuan', 'Li, Hui', 'Hu, Po', 'Qing, Yingjie', 'Wang, Xiangyuan', 'Zhu, Mengyuan', 'Wang, Hongzheng', 'Wang, Zhanyu', 'Xu, Jingyan', 'Guo, Qinglong', 'Hui, Hui']","['Yu X', 'Li H', 'Hu P', 'Qing Y', 'Wang X', 'Zhu M', 'Wang H', 'Wang Z', 'Xu J', 'Guo Q', 'Hui H']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5165-2592'],"['State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of medicine & Holostic integrative medicine, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated DrumTower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Key Laboratory of Drug Quality Control and Pharmacovigilance, Ministry of Education, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Drug Design and Optimization, China Pharmaceutical University, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Transl Med,Clinical and translational medicine,101597971,,,,PMC7449246,['NOTNLM'],"['ABC transporter genes', 'CBF-AML', 'HDAC-1/8 inhibitors', 'differentiation', 'natural product']",2020/09/09 06:00,2020/09/09 06:01,['2020/09/08 17:13'],"['2020/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/08 17:13 [entrez]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/ctm2.154 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transl Med. 2020 Aug;10(4):e154. doi: 10.1002/ctm2.154.,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

AKT signaling is active in MM and has pleiotropic effects; however, the key molecular aspects of AKT dependency in MM are not fully clear. Among the various downstream AKT targets are the Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors (TFs) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which are negatively regulated by AKT signaling. Here we show that abrogation of AKT signaling in MM cells provokes cell death and cell cycle arrest, which crucially depends on both FOXO TFs and GSK3. Based on gene expression profiling, we defined a FOXO-repressed gene set that has prognostic significance in a large cohort of patients with MM, indicating that AKT-mediated gene activation is associated with inferior overall survival. We further show that AKT signaling stabilizes the antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) protein by inhibiting FOXO- and GSK3-mediated MCL1 turnover. In concordance, abrogation of AKT signaling greatly sensitized MM cells for an MCL1-targeting BH3-mimetic, which is currently in clinical development. Taken together, our results indicate that AKT activity is required to restrain the tumor-suppressive functions of FOXO and GSK3, thereby stabilizing the antiapoptotic protein MCL1 in MM. These novel insights into the role of AKT in MM pathogenesis and MCL1 regulation provide opportunities to improve targeted therapy for patients with MM.","['Bloedjes, Timon A', 'de Wilde, Guus', 'Maas, Chiel', 'Eldering, Eric', 'Bende, Richard J', 'van Noesel, Carel J M', 'Pals, Steven T', 'Spaargaren, Marcel', 'Guikema, Jeroen E J']","['Bloedjes TA', 'de Wilde G', 'Maas C', 'Eldering E', 'Bende RJ', 'van Noesel CJM', 'Pals ST', 'Spaargaren M', 'Guikema JEJ']",,"['Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE), Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['*Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'Humans', '*Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC7479958,,,2020/09/09 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/09/08 17:13'],"['2020/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/08 17:13 [entrez]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31178-2 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001393 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Sep 8;4(17):4151-4164. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001393.,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study of recipients of allogeneic (Allo) and autologous (Auto) hematopoietic cell transplant and CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we aimed to identify clinical variables associated with COVID-19 severity and assess lymphocyte populations.METHODSWe retrospectively investigated patients diagnosed between March 15, 2020, and May 7, 2020. In a subset of patients, lymphocyte immunophenotyping, quantitative real-time PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody status were available.RESULTSWe identified 77 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were recipients of cellular therapy (Allo, 35; Auto, 37; CAR T, 5; median time from cellular therapy, 782 days; IQR, 354-1611 days). Overall survival at 30 days was 78%. Clinical variables significantly associated with the composite endpoint of nonrebreather or higher oxygen requirement and death (n events = 25 of 77) included number of comorbidities (HR 5.41, P = 0.004), infiltrates (HR 3.08, P = 0.032), and neutropenia (HR 1.15, P = 0.04). Worsening graft-versus-host disease was not identified among Allo recipients. Immune profiling revealed reductions and rapid recovery in lymphocyte populations across lymphocyte subsets. Antibody responses were seen in a subset of patients.CONCLUSIONIn this series of Allo, Auto, and CAR T recipients, we report overall favorable clinical outcomes for patients with COVID-19 without active malignancy and provide preliminary insights into the lymphocyte populations that are key for the antiviral response and immune reconstitution.FUNDINGNIH grant P01 CA23766 and NIH/National Cancer Institute grant P30 CA008748.","['Shah, Gunjan L', 'DeWolf, Susan', 'Lee, Yeon Joo', 'Tamari, Roni', 'Dahi, Parastoo B', 'Lavery, Jessica A', 'Ruiz, Josel', 'Devlin, Sean M', 'Cho, Christina', 'Peled, Jonathan U', 'Politikos, Ioannis', 'Scordo, Michael', 'Babady, N Esther', 'Jain, Tania', 'Vardhana, Santosha', 'Daniyan, Anthony', 'Sauter, Craig S', 'Barker, Juliet N', 'Giralt, Sergio A', 'Goss, Cheryl', 'Maslak, Peter', 'Hohl, Tobias M', 'Kamboj, Mini', 'Ramanathan, Lakshmi', 'van den Brink, Marcel Rm', 'Papadopoulos, Esperanza', 'Papanicolaou, Genovefa', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel']","['Shah GL', 'DeWolf S', 'Lee YJ', 'Tamari R', 'Dahi PB', 'Lavery JA', 'Ruiz J', 'Devlin SM', 'Cho C', 'Peled JU', 'Politikos I', 'Scordo M', 'Babady NE', 'Jain T', 'Vardhana S', 'Daniyan A', 'Sauter CS', 'Barker JN', 'Giralt SA', 'Goss C', 'Maslak P', 'Hohl TM', 'Kamboj M', 'Ramanathan L', 'van den Brink MR', 'Papadopoulos E', 'Papanicolaou G', 'Perales MA']",,"['Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.', 'Infectious Disease Service, Department of Medicine.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.', 'Clinical Microbiology Service, Department of Laboratory Medicine.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.', 'Lymphoma Service and.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine;

Although most patients are cured, those with disease arising in the mediastinum have distinctly poor outcomes. One in every 17 patients with primary mediastinal nonseminomatous GCTs develop an incurable hematologic malignancy and prior data intriguingly suggest a clonal relationship exists between hematologic malignancies and GCTs in these cases. To date, however, the precise clonal relationship between GCTs and the diverse additional somatic malignancies arising in such individuals have not been determined. Here, we traced the clonal evolution and characterized the genetic features of each neoplasm from a cohort of 15 patients with GCTs and associated hematologic malignancies. We discovered that GCTs and hematologic malignancies developing in such individuals evolved from a common shared precursor, nearly all of which harbored allelically imbalanced p53 and/or RAS pathway mutations. Hematologic malignancies arising in this setting genetically resembled mediastinal GCTs rather than de novo myeloid neoplasms. Our findings argue that this scenario represents a unique clinical syndrome, distinct from de novo GCTs or hematologic malignancies, initiated by an ancestral precursor that gives rise to the parallel evolution of GCTs and blood cancers in these patients.","['Taylor, Justin', 'Donoghue, Mark Ta', 'Ho, Caleb', 'Petrova-Drus, Kseniya', 'Al-Ahmadie, Hikmat A', 'Funt, Samuel A', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Aypar, Umut', 'Rao, Pavitra', 'Chavan, Shweta S', 'Haddadin, Michael', 'Tamari, Roni', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Rampal, Raajit K', 'Baez, Priscilla', 'Kappagantula, Rajya', 'Kosuri, Satyajit', 'Dogan, Ahmet', 'Tickoo, Satish K', 'Reuter, Victor E', 'Bosl, George J', 'Iacobuzio-Donahue, Christine A', 'Solit, David B', 'Taylor, Barry S', 'Feldman, Darren R', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar']","['Taylor J', 'Donoghue MT', 'Ho C', 'Petrova-Drus K', 'Al-Ahmadie HA', 'Funt SA', 'Zhang Y', 'Aypar U', 'Rao P', 'Chavan SS', 'Haddadin M', 'Tamari R', 'Giralt S', 'Tallman MS', 'Rampal RK', 'Baez P', 'Kappagantula R', 'Kosuri S', 'Dogan A', 'Tickoo SK', 'Reuter VE', 'Bosl GJ', 'Iacobuzio-Donahue CA', 'Solit DB', 'Taylor BS', 'Feldman DR', 'Abdel-Wahab O']",,"['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Marie-Josee and Henry R.

As MHC ligand hydrophobicity correlates positively with immunogenicity, identification of more hydrophobic MHC ligands could potentially lead to more effective isolation of immunogenic peptides as targets for immunotherapies. We solved this problem by use of higher concentrations of acetonitrile for the separation of MHC ligands and their respective complexes. This increased overall MHC ligand identifications by 2-fold, increased detection of cancer germline antigen-derived peptides by 50%, and resulted in profound variations in isolation efficacy between different MHC alleles correlating with the hydrophobicity of their anchor residues. Overall, these insights enabled a more complete view of the immunopeptidome and overcame a systematic underrepresentation of these critical MHC ligands of high hydrophobicity.","['Klatt, Martin G', 'Mack, Kyeara N', 'Bai, Yang', 'Aretz, Zita E H', 'Nathan, Levy I', 'Mun, Sung Soo', 'Dao, Tao', 'Scheinberg, David A']","['Klatt MG', 'Mack KN', 'Bai Y', 'Aretz ZEH', 'Nathan LI', 'Mun SS', 'Dao T', 'Scheinberg DA']",,"['Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Pharmacology Department and.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Pharmacology Department and.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Physiology Biophysics and Systems Biology Program, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Pharmacology Department and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20201002,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,"['0 (Acetonitriles)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'Z072SB282N (acetonitrile)']",IM,"['Acetonitriles/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Antigen Presentation/*immunology', 'Chromatography, Affinity/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC7566711,['NOTNLM'],"['*Antigen presentation', '*Immunology', '*Immunotherapy', '*MHC class 1']",2020/09/09 06:00,2021/06/10 06:00,['2020/09/08 17:11'],"['2020/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/09/08 17:11 [entrez]']","['141264 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.141264 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2020 Oct 2;5(19). pii: 141264. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.141264.,,"['P01 CA023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA241894/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Molt-4 cells were tagged with firefly-luciferase (F-Luc) by lentiviral infection, and fluorescence intensity of the cells was detected using a luminescence detector. Molt-4 cell lines with beta-arrestin1 overexpression or knockdown were constructed by lentivirus infection and injected via the tail vein in sub-lethal irradiated NCG mice. Body weight changes and survival time of the xenografted mice were observed, and the progression of T-ALL in the mice was evaluated using an in vivo fluorescence imaging system. Sixteen days after xenografting, the mice were euthanatized and tumor cell infiltration was observed in the slices of the liver and spleen. RESULTS: We successfully tagged Molt-4 cells with F-Luc and overexpressed or knocked down beta-arrestin1 in the tagged cells. Bioluminescent imaging showed obvious luminescence catalyzed by F-Luc in Molt-4 cells. After injection of Molt-4-Luc cells into irradiated NCG mice, a gradual enhancement of luminescence in the xenografted mice was observed over time, while the body weight of the mice decreased. Compared with the control mice, the mice xenografted with beta-arrestin1-overexpressing Molt-4 cells had significantly prolonged survival time (P &lt; 0.001), while the survival time of the mice xenografted with Molt-4 cells with beta- arrestin1 knockdown was significantly shortened (P &lt; 0.001). Histological examination revealed fewer infiltrating tumor cells in the liver and spleen of the mice xenografted with beta-arrestin1-overexpressing Molt-4 cells in comparison with the mice bearing parental Molt-4 cell xenografts. CONCLUSIONS: beta-arrestin1 overexpression suppresses tumor progression in mice bearing Molt-4 cell xenograft.","['Zhang, Jia', 'Shu, Yi', 'Zhang, Hongyang', 'Jiang, Tingting', 'Gong, Maoyuan', 'Zhu, Dan', 'Wang, Haobiao', 'Zou, Lin']","['Zhang J', 'Shu Y', 'Zhang H', 'Jiang T', 'Gong M', 'Zhu D', 'Wang H', 'Zou L']",,"[""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Stem Cell Therapy, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Stem Cell Therapy, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Stem Cell Therapy, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Stem Cell Therapy, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Stem Cell Therapy, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Stem Cell Therapy, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Stem Cell Therapy, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Engineering Research Center of Stem Cell Therapy, Chongqing 400014, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,['0 (beta-Arrestin 1)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Progression', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'beta-Arrestin 1']",PMC7277325,['NOTNLM'],"['Molt-4 cells', 'T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'live imaging', 'xenografts', 'beta-arrestin1']",2020/09/09 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2020/09/08 12:13'],"['2020/09/08 12:13 [entrez]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.05.07 [doi]'],ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2020 May 30;40(5):654-660. doi: 10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.05.07.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing emphasis is being placed on precise detection of the minimal residual disease. Following antigen recommendations of ERIC and ESCCA's Harmonization Project, we validated a 14-color assay for the characterization CD5+ lymphoproliferative neoplasms and CLL MRD with a sensitivity of at least 10(-4) . METHODS: The assay was designed based on ERIC/ESCCA recommended antigens with the addition of CD40 for alternate gating when CD19 expression is reduced. Lower limit of quantitation/lower limit of detection, assay procedural precision, linearity, and limit of blank were established. Then, 52 CD5+ B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms (41 CLL/11 non-CLL) and 29 normal samples were used for parallel evaluation. Automated cluster identification and quantitation of CLL clones in MRD setting was performed using Barned-Hutt SNE. Separation analysis between CLL and non-CLL phenotypes was performed by PCA and bh-SNE. RESULTS: Separation ratios for each antigen exceeded ERIC/ESCCA guidelines. Precision was <20% at LLOQ (0.01%). The limit of blank was <10/500,000 cells. Concordance between the 14-color and legacy assay (Deming regression y = 1.01x, r(2) = .99) was seen. All 20 samples with MRD levels 0.5%-0.006% (median 0.04%) showed an abnormal cell cluster by bh-SNE, with concordant results between manual and automated quantitation (y = x, r(2) = 1). CLL cases clustered together and away from mantle cell lymphoma by bh-SNE and PCA with outlier atypical phenotype CLL cases posing diagnostic challenges by both manual and automated analysis. CONCLUSION: The 14-color CD5+ LPD assay provides a robust standardization platform for MRD and disease characterization using both manual and automated analysis.","['Goshaw, Jennifer M', 'Gao, Qi', 'Wardrope, Jessica', 'Dogan, Ahmet', 'Roshal, Mikhail']","['Goshaw JM', 'Gao Q', 'Wardrope J', 'Dogan A', 'Roshal M']",,"['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, New York, New York, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, New York, New York, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, New York, New York, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, New York, New York, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Service, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200908,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

These genes are abnormally expressed in many cancers. We found that the expression level of Ring finger protein 220 (RNF220) was negatively correlated with the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. Moreover, the mRNA level of this gene is significantly higher in the bone marrow cells of AML patients than in the mobilized peripheral blood haematopoietic stem cells of healthy donors. The overexpression of RNF220 promotes the proliferation of AML cells and accelerates the transition from G1 phase to S phase. Increased protein levels and decreased ubiquitylation levels of Cyclin D1 were observed in the nuclei of cells overexpressing RNF220 compared to those of control cells. The protein level of USP22 was also increased in cells overexpressing RNF220. RNF220 cannot enhance the stability of the Cyclin D1 protein without increased expression of the USP22 protein.

Here, we aimed to explore the genetic effects of the KMT2A gene on litter size in females of the Chinese indigenous cashmere goat, using a large sample size (n > 1,000), based on their levels of RNA transcription and DNA variation. First, mRNA expression levels of this gene in ovarian tissues between the low-prolific group (first-born litter size = 1) and high-prolific group (first-born litter size >/=2) were significantly different, revealing the potential functioning of KMT2A in goat prolific. Moreover, a novel 13-nt nucleotide sequence variant was identified in Shaanbei white cashmere goats (n = 1,616). In accordance with the independent chi-square (chi(2)) analysis, the distribution of genotypes (P = 2.57 x 10(-9)) and allelotypes (P = 3.00 x 10(-7)) between the low- and high-prolific groups differed significantly, indicating the 13-nt mutation was associated with litter size. Further analysis showed that the insertion/insertion (II) genotype was significantly different with insertion/deletion (ID) (P = 1.76 x 10(-9)) and deletion/deletion (DD) (P = 7.00 x 10(-6)), with goats having the DD genotype producing an average litter size larger than the other genotypes. Taken together, these findings suggest KMT2A can serve as a candidate gene for breeding goats, which may have implications for improving the future development of the goat industry.","['Tang, Q', 'Zhang, Y', 'Yang, Y', 'Hu, H', 'Lan, X', 'Pan, C']","['Tang Q', 'Zhang Y', 'Yang Y', 'Hu H', 'Lan X', 'Pan C']",,"['College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Shaanxi Province, Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, No. 22 Xinong Road, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, PR China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Shaanxi Province, Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, No. 22 Xinong Road, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, PR China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Shaanxi Province, Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, No. 22 Xinong Road, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, PR China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Shaanxi Province, Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, No. 22 Xinong Road, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, PR China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Shaanxi Province, Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, No. 22 Xinong Road, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, PR China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Northwest A&F University, Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Shaanxi Province, Key Laboratory of Animal Biotechnology, Ministry of Agriculture, No. 22 Xinong Road, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, PR China.

Vasculitis was diagnosed prior to MDS/CMML in 31 patients (44%), and after in 20 patients. In comparison with MDS/CMML without autoimmune/inflammatory features, vasculitis with MDS/MPN showed no difference in MDS/CMML subtypes distribution nor International Prognostic Scoring System and CMML-specific prognostic (IPSS/CPSS) scores. Vasculitis subtypes included Giant cell arteritis in 24 patients (34%), Behcet's-like syndrome in 11 patients (20%) and polyarteritis nodosa in 6 patients (9%). Glucocorticoids (GCs) were used as first-line therapy for MDS/CMML vasculitis in 64/70 patients (91%) and 41 (59%) received combined immunosuppressive therapies during the follow-up. After a median follow-up of 33.2 months [1-162], 31 patients (44%) achieved sustained remission. At least one relapse occurred in 43 patients (61%). Relapse rates were higher in patients treated with conventional Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARDs) (odds ratio 4.86 [95% CI 1.38 - 17.10]), but did not differ for biologics (odds ratio 0.59 [95% CI 0.11-3.20]) and azacytidine (odds ratio 1.44 [95% CI 0.21-9.76]) than under glucocorticoids. Overall survival in MDS/CMML vasculitis was not significantly different from MDS/CMML patients without autoimmune/inflammatory features (p=0.5), but acute leukemia progression rates were decreased (log rank <0.05). CONCLUSION: This study shows no correlation of vasculitis diagnoses with subtypes and severity of MDS/CMML, and no significant impact of vasculitis on overall survival. Whereas conventional DMARDs seem to be less effective, biologics or azacytidine therapy could be considered for even low-risk MDS/CMML vasculitis.","['Roupie, Anne Laure', 'Guedon, Alexis', 'Terrier, Benjamin', 'Lahuna, Constance', 'Jachiet, Vincent', 'Regent, Alexis', 'de Boysson, Hubert', 'Carrat, Fabrice', 'Seguier, Julie', 'Terriou, Louis', 'Versini, Mathilde', 'Queyrel, Viviane', 'Groh, Matthieu', 'Benhamou, Ygal', 'Maurier, Francois', 'Ledoult, Emmanuel', 'Clech, Lenaig Le', ""D'Aveni, Maud"", 'Rossignol, Julien', 'Galland, Joris', 'Willems, Lise', 'Chiche, Noemie Jourde', 'Peterlin, Pierre', 'Roux-Sauvat, Marielle', 'Parcelier, Anne', 'Wemeau, Matthieu', 'Lambert, Marc', 'Belizna, Cristina', 'Puechal, Xavier', 'Swiader, Laure', 'Cohen-Valensi, Rolande', 'Noc, Valerie', 'Dao, Emmanuel', 'Thepot, Sylvain', 'de Fremont, Gregoire Martin', 'Tanguy-Schmidt, Aline', 'Koka, Anne Marfaing', 'Bussone, Guillaume', 'Philipponnet, Carole', 'Konate, Amadou', 'Cavaille, Guilhem', 'Guilpain, Philippe', 'Allain, Jean-Sebastien', 'Broner, Jonathan', 'Solary, Eric', 'Ruivard, Marc', 'de Renzis, Benoit', 'Corm, Selim', 'Baati, Nadia', 'Schleinitz, Nicolas', 'Ponsoye, Matthieu', 'Stamatoullas-Bastard, Aspasia', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Dellal, Azeddine', 'Tchirkov, Andrei', 'Aouba, Achille', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Fain, Olivier', 'Mekinian, Arsene']","['Roupie AL', 'Guedon A', 'Terrier B', 'Lahuna C', 'Jachiet V', 'Regent A', 'de Boysson H', 'Carrat F', 'Seguier J', 'Terriou L', 'Versini M', 'Queyrel V', 'Groh M', 'Benhamou Y', 'Maurier F', 'Ledoult E', 'Clech LL', ""D'Aveni M"", 'Rossignol J', 'Galland J', 'Willems L', 'Chiche NJ', 'Peterlin P', 'Roux-Sauvat M', 'Parcelier A', 'Wemeau M', 'Lambert M', 'Belizna C', 'Puechal X', 'Swiader L', 'Cohen-Valensi R', 'Noc V', 'Dao E', 'Thepot S', 'de Fremont GM', 'Tanguy-Schmidt A', 'Koka AM', 'Bussone G', 'Philipponnet C', 'Konate A', 'Cavaille G', 'Guilpain P', 'Allain JS', 'Broner J', 'Solary E', 'Ruivard M', 'de Renzis B', 'Corm S', 'Baati N', 'Schleinitz N', 'Ponsoye M', 'Stamatoullas-Bastard A', 'Ades L', 'Dellal A', 'Tchirkov A', 'Aouba A', 'Fenaux P', 'Fain O', 'Mekinian A']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Inflammation-Immunopathology-Biotherapy Department (DHU i2B), Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Saint-Antoine, 184, rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine, 75012 Paris, France Sorbonne Universite, Paris, France;

However, survivors of childhood ALL that received cranial radiotherapy are at increased risk for deficits in neurocognitive skills. The continuous and dynamic response of normal tissue after irradiation has been identified as one of the causative factors for cognitive changes after cranial radiation therapy. The aim of our study was to investigate the radiation effects on social behavior and neuronal morphology in the hippocampus of adult mice. Twenty-oneday-old male C57BL/6 mice were irradiated with the small-animal radiation research platform (SARRP). Animals were given a single 10-Gy dose of radiation of X-ray cranial radiation. One month following irradiation, animals underwent behavioral testing in the Three-Chamber Sociability paradigm. Radiation affected social discrimination during the third stage eliciting an inability to discriminate between the familiar and stranger mouse, while sham successfully spent more time exploring the novel stranger. Proteomic analysis revealed dysregulation of metabolic and signaling pathways associated with neurocognitive dysfunction such as mitochondrial dysfunction, Rac 1 signaling, and synaptogenesis signaling. We observed significant decreases in mushroom spine density in the Cornu Ammonis 2 of the hippocampus, which is associated with sociability processing.","['Newton, Jamila', 'Brown, Taurean', 'Corley, Christa', 'Alexander, Tyler', 'Trujillo, Madison', 'McElroy, Taylor', 'Ntagwabira, Fabio', 'Wang, Jing', 'Byrum, Stephanie D', 'Allen, Antino R']","['Newton J', 'Brown T', 'Corley C', 'Alexander T', 'Trujillo M', 'McElroy T', 'Ntagwabira F', 'Wang J', 'Byrum SD', 'Allen AR']",,"['California State University, Stanislaus, Turlock, CA 95382, United States.', 'Division of Radiation Health, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States.', 'Division of Radiation Health, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States.', 'Division of Radiation Health, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States.', 'Division of Radiation Health, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States.', 'Division of Radiation Health, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States.', 'Division of Radiation Health, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States.', 'Division of Radiation Health, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States.', ""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States; Arkansas Children's Research Institute, Little Rock, AR 72202, United States."", 'Division of Radiation Health, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, United States; Neurobiology & Developmental Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, United States.
