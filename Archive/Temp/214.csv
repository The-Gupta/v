We reviewed blood and bone marrow morphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetics, as well as the clinical findings, of 17 patients with AML-M0. Most patients were male, with a median age of 62 years. Minimal background myelodysplastic features were identified in only 5 of 15 patients. Cytochemical stains for myeloperoxidase and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase were negative in the leukemic blasts of all specimens. Positivity for one or both myeloid-associated antigens, CD13 and CD33, was seen in all patients. Both CD34 and HLA-DR were positive in all tested cases. Lymphoid-associated antigens were identified in seven patients; these antigens were typically dim or weak in intensity. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase positivity was seen in 14 of 14 tested patients; monoclonal anti-myeloperoxidase reactivity was seen in the blasts of 2 patients. Abnormal clonal karyotypes were found in 6 of 14 patients. Abnormalities of chromosomes 7 and 13 were the most common findings, most frequently manifested by monosomy 7 and trisomy 13. The median follow-up was 8 months. Eight patients died of their disease, three are alive with disease, and six are in first or second remission (including three patients treated with bone marrow transplantation). When narrowly defined, AML-M0 appears to be a homogeneous entity that affects older and predominantly male patients. It has no single karyotypic abnormality, but complex karyotypes with monosomy 7 and trisomy 13 are commonly found. Acute myeloid leukemia with minimal differentiation is relatively resistant to chemotherapy; however, bone marrow transplantation may provide a better outcome for eligible patients.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['Am J Clin Pathol. 1998 Jan;109(1):3-5.

The identification of Ph-positive patients is vitally important because only aggressive therapeutic approaches, such as allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, may result in long-term disease-free survival. Routine diagnostic methods, such as Southern blot analysis and cytogenetics, may lead to false-negative results. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis is considered the most sensitive tool for the detection of the bcr-abl translocation, and it is widely used alone or in combination with karyotyping or Southern blot analysis to identify Ph-positive cases. In this study, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with BCR and ABL double-color probes for detecting Ph-positive leukemias. The FISH results were compared with the results of cytogenetic and RT-PCR analyses in 75 patients with leukemia or other myeloproliferative syndromes (chronic myeloid leukemia, 30; acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 24; acute myelogenous leukemia, 6; essential (hemorrhagic) thrombocythemia, 12; chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, 2; and polycythemia vera, 1). FISH analysis proved to be simple, extremely reliable and sensitive; bcr-abl fusion detection was successful in the presence of all types of molecular junctions i.e., (b2a2, b3a2, and e1a2). Furthermore, a Ph-positive case that proved fusion negative by RT-PCR was identified as positive by FISH. The sensitivity of RT-PCR and FISH related to Ph-positive cases were 97% and 100%, respectively. Regarding specificity, in 4 (5%) of 75 patients, RT-PCR provided false-positive results. Cross-contamination was identified because a new specimen was harvested and reanalyzed when FISH, cytogenetics, and RT-PCR results were contradictory. We believe FISH is an optimal diagnostic method to detect bcr-abl translocation that can be used alone or to validate the results of RT-PCR analysis.","[""Department of Hematology, University of Tor Vergata, Ospedale S'Eugenio, Rome, Italy.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its detection is routinely accomplished by Southern blot analysis and karyotyping. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are emerging molecular techniques that offer viable alternatives. We analyzed 40 samples of peripheral blood and bone marrow (CML, 16; acute myelogenous leukemia, 6; acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], 1; chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, 2; myelodysplasias, 4; myeloproliferative disorders, unclassified, 3; nonleukemic hematologic malignancies, 3; hypercellular bone marrow, 1; normal control samples, 2; and K562 cell line samples, 2) for the presence of bcr-abl fusion gene and its messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript by FISH and RT-PCR, respectively. We compared the results with results of Southern blot analysis and karyotyping when available. Cost analysis was performed. Thirty-three samples were evaluable by FISH; 14 of 14 evaluable CML samples and one ALL sample were positive for bcr-abl by FISH (100%). The other 15 evaluable samples were negative; 16 of 16 (100%) and 13 of 16 (81%) of CML cases were positive for bcr-abl mRNA by RT-PCR (chemiluminescent blot method) and RT-PCR (colorimetric method), respectively. The ALL sample was positive by both RT-PCR methods. All other samples were negative by RT-PCR (chemiluminescent blot method), and all but 1 case of myeloproliferative disorder tested negative by RT-PCR (colorimetric method). We conclude the utility of FISH and RT-PCR is associated with certain limitations, such as insufficient RNA for RT-PCR and the occasional absence of internal positive FISH control signals. However, each procedure offers (with a high concordance rate) a specific and cost-effective alternative to Southern blot analysis and karyotyping and improved turnaround time for the detection of bcr-abl fusion gene or its mRNA transcript.","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195, USA.']",['Am J Clin Pathol. 1998 Jan;109(1):3-5.

We have shown previously that ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) potently inhibits photoreceptor differentiation in cultures of rat retina. The present study analyzes which developmental processes are affected by CNTF. Rod differentiation as determined by opsin and recoverin immunocytochemistry was effectively blocked by CNTF and leukemia inhibitory factor, but not by other neurotrophic agents tested. CNTF did not influence proliferation, cell death, or survival, and had no effect on the downregulation of nestin immunoreactivity in progenitor cells. Opsin-positive rods could be reverted to an opsin-negative state initially, but became unresponsive to CNTF later. No compensatory increase in the number of other cell types was observed. Application of neutralizing antibodies against CNTF revealed that rod development was partially blocked by an endogenous CNTF-like molecule in control cultures. Our results suggest that CNTF can act as a specific negative regulator of rod differentiation. Its action on photoreceptor precursor cells could serve to synchronize the maturation of photoreceptors, which are born over an extended period of time. Together with other stimulatory signals, CNTF may thus control the temporally and numerically correct integration of photoreceptors into the retinal network.","['Institute of Anatomy, University of Freiburg, P.O.

Eleven of 98 such patients (11%; 95% confidence interval, 6-19%) showed rearrangement of ALL1 at diagnosis. The partial tandem duplication of ALL1 was responsible for ALL1 rearrangement in all such cases examined, making it a frequent molecular defect in adult AML patients with normal cytogenetics. Furthermore, patients with ALL1 rearrangement had a significantly shorter duration of complete remission when compared to patients without ALL1 rearrangement (P = 0.01; median, 7.1 versus 23.2 months).

We report the cloning of a novel fusion oncogene associated with a unique leukaemia/lymphoma syndrome. Patients afflicted with this syndrome present with lymphoblastic lymphoma and a myeloproliferative disorder, often accompanied by pronounced peripheral eosinophilia and/or prominent eosinophilic infiltrates in the affected bone marrow, which generally progress to full-blown acute myelogenous leukaemia within a year of diagnosis. A specific chromosome translocation, t(8;13)(p11;q11-12), is found in both lymphoma and myeloid leukaemia cells from these patients, supporting bi-lineage differentiation from a transformed stem cell. We find that the 8p11 translocation breakpoints, in each of four patients, interrupt intron 8 of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 gene (FGFR1). These translocations are associated with aberrant transcripts in which four predicted zinc-finger domains, contributed by a novel and widely expressed chromosome-13 gene (ZNF198), are fused to the FGFR1 tyrosine-kinase domain. Transient expression studies show that the ZNF198-FGFR1 fusion transcript directs the synthesis of an approximately 87-kD polypeptide, localizing predominantly to the cytoplasm. Our studies demonstrate an FGFR1 oncogenic role and suggest a tumorigenic mechanism in which ZNF198-FGFR1 activation results from ZNF198 zinc-finger-mediated homodimerization.","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",,['CA72791/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['GENBANK/AF012126'],,,,,,,,,,,

Even though histocompatible bone marrow transplantation has been applied for the treatment of Hurler syndrome, gene therapy via autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) may be more beneficial for this disease. Two retroviral vectors containing a full-length human IDUA cDNA were constructed using Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based vector backbones. High-titer vector-producing clones containing the L-HuID-SN and MFG-HuID retroviral vectors were established. The efficiency of gene transfer into primitive human CD34+ hematopoietic cells using both retroviral vectors is in the range of 18-23%. The level of enzyme expression in transduced primary bone marrow cells was increased 40- to 50-fold compared with that of sham-transduced cells. Enzyme produced by the progeny of the transduced human CD34+ cells carrying IDUA cDNA corrected Hurler fibroblasts via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.

The mechanisms involved in mediating numerous functions of 1,25(OH)2D3 are not clearly understood. In addition to genomic actions involving nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), some rapid nongenomic responses have been observed, but the full signalling pathway activated by 1,25(OH)2D3 has still not been described. Our recent data allow for better understanding of nongenomic effects evoked by 1,25(OH)2D3. In this paper we show that mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) is activated in HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and in normal human keratinocytes under exposure to differentiation inducing concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3. The MAPK is then transported to the cell nucleus in active form, which is different from the activation evoked by fetal calf serum. Experiments utilising tyrosine kinase inhibitor suggested that the postulated putative membrane vitamin D receptor, if it exists, does not have tyrosine kinase activity. Usage of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor allowed to state that PKC is an upstream element in the MAPK signalling pathway.","['Department of Tumor Immunology, Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland. marcinko@immuno.pan.wroc.pl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-addition of fatty acids and thapsigargin leads to initial rates of Ca2+ mobilization much greater than that induced by either compound alone. The responses induced by the fatty acids are observed also with other lipophiles like sphingosine, bromo-palmitate and the Ca2+ influx inhibitor econazole; all responses are rapidly reversed by addition of bovine serum albumin. Many of the above effects of fatty acids are observed also in Jurkat T lymphocytes and Friend erythroleukemia cells.

In this study we characterized human lung-derived epithelial-like HTB58 cells for their ability to synthesize alpha1-PI after treatment with IL-6, OSM and LIF. The results demonstrate that the resistance of HTB58 cells to the effects of IL-6 and LIF was not because of a lack of their individual functional receptors and suggest that OSM utilizes two different receptors, gp130/LIF receptor and gp130/OSM receptor, in lung-derived epithelial cells.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Molecular Biology, Jagiellonian University, 31-120 Krakow, Poland.']",,"['HL 26148/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 37090/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1219049,,,,,,,,,,

No specific therapy is needed. The paper presents clinical, morphological and immunological analysis of 34 cases of benign CLL (17 males and 17 females, mean age 58 years). Patients were included in the study if they had lymphocyte count less than 30,000 and no significant growth of lymphoid tissue for at least 3 years. They were followed up from 3 to 24 years (11 years, on the average). The main features of benign CLL are the following: no ""B"" symptoms, no essential enlargement of the lymphoid organs, a stable low level of absolute lymphocytosis, low prolymphocyte count in the blood smear (0.95% +/- 0.2), nodular or nodular-interstitial proliferation in the bone marrow. We failed to find any cases with paraprotein secretion. There was immunophenotype typical for CLL in 91% of cases (CD19+, CD20+, CD23+, CD5+, EM+, CR1-/CR2+, sIg+(-)).

The purpose of this investigation was to examine whether ultraviolet A-induced cell injury was amplified by the presence of a non-ultraviolet A absorbing molecule capable of generating free radicals. Benzoyl peroxide was used as a lipid soluble potential radical-generating agent. Plasma membrane permeability assessed by trypan blue uptake was used to measure cell damage in murine leukemia L1210 cells. Cells were irradiated with a pulsed Nd/YAG laser at 355 nm using 0-160 J per cm2. The ratio of the fluence-response slope in the presence of 40 microM benzoyl peroxide to that of irradiated controls was 4.3 +/- 2.6. Benzoyl peroxide alone or benzoyl peroxide added after irradiation did not cause increased trypan blue uptake. The ratio of the fluence-response slopes in the presence of 40 microM benzoyl peroxide to that of irradiated controls was 4.7 +/- 1.4 when cells were irradiated (0-43 J per cm2) with a xenon lamp, filtered to remove wavelengths <320 nm. The increased trypan blue uptake in 355 nm-irradiated cells in the presence of benzoyl peroxide was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by butylated hydroxytoluene, vitamin E, and trolox, a water-soluble vitamin E derivative. Lipid oxidation, assessed as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, was significantly increased in samples irradiated with ultraviolet A in the presence of benzoyl peroxide at fluences >34 J per cm2. The increased trypan blue uptake and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were inhibited by butylated hydroxytoluene. These results suggest that agents not absorbing ultraviolet A radiation may enhance ultraviolet A-initiated oxidative stress in cells.","['Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston 02114, USA.']",,['R01 GM30755/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, he showed consciousness disturbance, and had frequent attacks of generalized seizure. His electroencephalogram showed slow waves, and a spike and wave complex. Hyperammonemia and abnormal amino acid distribution were also found. This abnormal serum amino acid distribution, especially elevated glycine level, was different from that seen in chronic liver failure, and he had no hepatic disease. After intensive chemotherapy, the serum ammonia level and glycine level decreased. In this patient, PCL seemed to be responsible for HOCF, hyperammonemia, and abnormal amino acid distribution.

Herein, we report a large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia patient with pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) after renal transplantation. A 36-year-old female was presented to our department with anemia in February 1996. She had undergone hemodialysis because of pregnancy in December 1981. She received a renal transplantation from her mother in April 1986. After the transplantation, she received cyclosporin A (CyA) at 2 mg/kg/day, mizoribine at 1 mg/kg/day, and methylprednisolone at 0.1 mg/kg/day for 8 years. In July 1995, her hemoglobin level dropped to 9.3 g/dl, and anemia developed gradually. In January 1996, her hemoglobin was 5.8 g/dl, and she was given a red blood cell transfusion. Laboratory findings were as follows: RBC 1.46 x 10(12)/L; hemoglobin 5.8 g/dl; hematocrit 17.8%; leucocytes 5.2 x 10(9)/L with 62.4% neutrophils, 34.1% lymphocytes, 2.6% monocytes; platelets 50.8 x 10(10)/L; reticulocytes 0.4%. Bone marrow aspirate smears and biopsy sections revealed normal myeloid and megakaryocyte differentiation with few erythroid precursors. The lymphocytes were of medium size with granules in the cytoplasm. More than 90% of lymphocytes were of the LGL type. Surface markers of peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated increases in the CD2+, CD3+, CD4-, and CD8+ populations. A monoclonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta chain gene was found by Southern blot analysis of the mononuclear cells in peripheral blood. A diagnosis of LGL leukemia with PRCA was made. During the next 4 months, she received six red blood cell transfusions, a total of 12 U. In March 1996, the patient was treated with cyclophosphamide (1 mg/kg/day). After 1 month of treatment, serum GPT levels increased to 60 IU/l. The dose of cyclophosphamide was reduced to 0.5 mg/kg/day. Two months after initiation of the therapy, the patient developed reticulocytosis and blood transfusion was not needed thereafter. During remission, the number of CD2+, CD3+, CD4-, and CD8+ lymphocytes decreased. Large granular lymphocytes decreased to less than 10% of peripheral blood. The monoclonal rearrangement of the TCR-beta chain gene in peripheral blood disappeared.","[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical College, Japan.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study the cancer incidence in 4128 men and 191 women, who had worked for at least one year in the petroleum industry, was compared with the incidence in the general population. The job titles and employment times for each person were found in personal files in the industries. The men had on average worked in jobs exposed to petroleum for 11.6 years at the end of the observation period. The cases of cancer were identified by record linkage with the Swedish cancer register. RESULTS: In total there were 146 cases of cancer v 157.6 expected (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 0.93 90% confidence interval (90% CI) 0.80 to 1.1). Operators at refineries had an increased risk of leukaemia (6 cases v 1.7 expected, 90% CI of relative risk (RR) 1.5 to 7.0). Five of the six cases had started to work at the refineries in the 1950s or later. No other significantly increased risk of cancer was found. Distribution workers had a decreased incidence of lung cancer (no cases, 90% CI of RR 0 to 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Operators at Swedish refineries had an increased risk of leukaemia. A possible cause is exposure to benzene. There was no increased risk of leukaemia in distribution workers. Distribution workers had a decreased risk of lung cancer.","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Umea University, Sweden.']",,,,,PMC1128845,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Through a review of papers considering the risk of leukaemia among people living near high voltage transmission lines, the combined risks of leukaemia were calculated for distances < or = 50 m and < or = 25 m and for exposures at 2 mG, 3 mG, 4 mG, and 10 mG. RESULTS: The combined analysis of the contributive studies indicated an estimate of risk (odds ratio (OR)) for exposure > or = 2 mG of 1.3, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.0 to 1.7. The ORs increased with exposures at 3 mG, 4 mG, and 10 mG. The risks were also increased for distances of 50 and 25 m from the lines. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis tends to confirm the presence of an association between exposure to magnetic fields and leukaemia among people who reside in the vicinity of high voltage transmission electric lines of > or = 49 kV. There is consistency across studies. Measures of exposure used in the studies were either distance from the lines or calculated fields estimated from pertinent line features. The results apply to adults as well as to children.","['Department of Occupational Health, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",,,,,PMC1128834,,,,,,,,,,

In Europe and the United States, it has an age-adjusted incidence per million population per year of 2.2 compared to 11.0 in Japan and Korea. Pathogenic mechanisms are varied and include intrinsic defects of hematopoietic stem cells, defects in the marrow microenvironment, and abnormal humoral or cellular immune control of hematopoiesis. In most patients, aplastic anemia is of unknown etiology, whereas in some, the disease can be related to infections, drugs and chemicals, and hereditary causes. Therapy for aplastic anemia includes blood component transfusions, antibiotics, androgenic steroids, and corticosteroids. With supportive care, most patients with aplastic anemia die within a year of diagnosis, and only approximately 20% of patients are surviving, although often with persisting hematologic abnormalities. The use of hematopoietic growth factors has shown, for the most part, only transient beneficial effects. More definitive therapy has been the use of immunosuppressive agents including antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide. With immunosuppressive therapy, a variable proportion of patients respond to therapy, ranging from 20% to 80%. However, although responses may be frequent, long-term outlook is guarded because some patients may relapse with aplastic anemia, whereas others may go on to have a clonal disorder develop, including myelodysplasia, leukemia, or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. As a result, survival estimates at 15 to 18 years may be only on the order of 30%. More definitive therapy has been with transplants of hematopoietic stem cells from allogeneic donors. Transplants are carried out after high-dose immunosuppressive conditioning programs. Best current results show long-term, event-free survivals with successful allografts on the order of 90%.","['Transplantation Biology Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, USA.']",,"['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",34,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studies the efficacy of donor leukocyte transfusion (DLT) on acute and chronic leukemia in relapse after bone marrow transplantation in Japan. Sixty nine patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia (N = 17), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (N = 25), acute myelocytic leukemia (N = 26), myelodysplastic syndrome (N = 5), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (N = 2) and rhabdomyosarcoma (N = 1) were treated with transfusions of donor lymphocytes. Therapeutic effects were induced by donor leukocyte transfusion in 20 patients (29%) including 3 patients out of 4 (75%) with CML in cytogenetic and chronic phase relapse, 4 out of 5 (80%) patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, 3 out of 13 (23%) patients with CML in transformed phase, 5 out of 25 (20%) patients with acute myelocytic leukemia, and 4 out of 20 (20%) patients with acute lymphoblasic leukemia. Twenty two patients (30%) developed acute GVHD (> or = 2) and 6 out of 73 (8.2%) patients developed fatal GVHD after donor leukocyte transfusion. Patients relapsed within 6 months after marrow transplantation had a probability of having severe acute GVHD (> or = 2) after DLT. Fourteen out of 24 (58%) patients with GVL response were re-relapsed thereafter. Minimal dose of donor leukocytes infused in successfully treated 9 patients without cytoreductive therapy was 2 x 10(7)/kg in total and minimal dose of that in 6 patients with fatal GVHD was 7 x 10(7)/kg in total.

CDK6 is one of the targets of p16 and p15, CDK inhibitors encoded by MTS1 and MTS2, two tumor suppressor genes that are frequently deleted in T-cell leukemia. In this study we have investigated CDK6 expression in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissues using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. In normal (six samples) and hyperplastic (four samples) thymuses, strong CDK6 expression was observed in a discrete proportion of cortical thymocytes (10 to 15%), mainly located in the peripheral (subcapsular) zone of the cortex. All tested cases of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (T-LBL/ALL) showed strong CDK6 expression in the majority (up to 100%) of neoplastic lymphoid cells. Western blot analysis confirmed the expected CDK6 protein size (40 kd). According to Southern blot analysis, CDK6 overexpression in neoplastic T lymphoblasts was not due to gene amplification. In all other lymphomas investigated (28 peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin's lympohomas (T-NHLs), 7 CD30+ anaplastic NHLs, 22 high-grade B-NHLs, 15 low-grade B-NHLs, 25 B-cell precursor ALLs), CDK6 was not expressed or expressed at low levels, with the only exception of three nasal angiocentric T-NHLs, all exhibiting CDK6 immunoreactivity comparable to that observed in T-LBL/ALL. These data provide evidence that CDK6 is abnormally expressed in T-LBL/ALL and may be involved in the pathogenesis of this malignancy. In addition, the quantitative difference of CDK6 expression between neoplastic and non-neoplastic cortical thymocytes can be potentially useful in the differential diagnosis of thymic neoplasms on histological and cytological specimens.","['Istituto di Anatomia Patologica, Universita di Verona, Italy. marco@anpat.univ.it']",,,,,PMC1858129,,,,,,,,,,

Event-free survival (EFS) rates at 6 years after BMT were 0.49 +/- 0.05 and 0.48 +/- 0.09 for patients transplanted in CR2 and CR3, respectively. In context with the BFM chemotherapy trials for relapsed childhood ALL there is a clear benefit from BMT in 2nd CR for children with unfavorable prognostic features (isolated early BM relapse, very early BM relapse or BM relapse of T cell ALL). Similar control of leukemia can be achieved with either chemotherapy or BMT in late BM relapse of ALL. Assuming a 60% failure rate with chemotherapy for patients in second relapse, a third remission can be achieved in about 60% of patients who have received chemotherapy, rendering them eligible for BMT in 3rd CR. With this strategy 58% of these patients would survive and late sequelae of BMT be restricted to a minority.

We recently demonstrated the prognostic significance of this subgrouping and based on these results we suggested that typical and atypical CLL represent two closely related, but different entities. These results prompted us to investigate 42 patients diagnosed with CLL based on the results of lymph node biopsy in order to identify the histologic counterpart of the CLL variants. A first group of 14 cases showed a monomorphic proliferation of small round lymphocytes associated with the occurrence of small pseudofollicles. All these cases were diagnosed as typical CLL on peripheral blood (13 cases) or bone marrow smear (1 case). The remaining 28 cases showed aberrant histologic features characterized by the presence of large numbers of paraimmunoblasts and prolymphocytes, forming very large pseudofollicles, and/or by nuclear irregularities of the neoplastic cells. Based on peripheral blood smears (22 cases) or bone marrow smears (six cases), two cases showed no peripheral blood involvement, 21 cases were diagnosed as atypical CLL, and five as typical CLL. From these data we can conclude that a histologic counterpart of the CLL variants recognized in the FAB proposal does exist; moreover, our data may explain reports on lymph node involvement by CLL composed of small cleaved cells and clarify the occurrence of pseudofollicles in cases described as mantle cell lymphomas.","['Department of Pathology II, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A good correlation (80%) was found between Rh-123 accumulation and Pgp expression by phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase. A strict correlation (100%) was found between modulation by CSA of Rh-123 accumulation and immunoreactivity to Pgp.

Samples were derived from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), breast cancer, colon cancer, high and low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease, myelodysplastic syndrome, thyroid adenoma (TA) and from PBMCs of patients with breast cancer, gastric cancer, and of healthy individuals. We found abundant HERV-K env transcripts in all tissues under investigation. Using HERV-K 10 specific primers for amplification we detected in addition to transcripts with high homology to HERV-K 10 (ca. 96% homology on the amino acid level) also transcripts of low homology to HERV-K10 (ca. 71%). Interestingly, all solid tissues containing high percentages of malignant cells such as breast cancer, colon carcinoma, low and high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas showed exclusively HERV-K env related transcripts with low homology to HERV-K 10. In contrast, in samples containing only a low proportion of malignant cells or no malignant cells at all we observed both types of transcripts.

HTLV Tax, the viral transcriptional activator, can activate a variety of cellular genes. HTLV-mediated T-cell transformation, however, may involve additional viral proteins expressed from singly- as well as doubly-spliced viral mRNA. To determine the combined effect of these viral proteins on cellular gene expression in Jurkat T-cells, we derived stable transfectants that constitutively express the HTLV-I pX and env regions (J3.9). J3.9 cells show substantially increased mRNA levels of egr-1 and c-jun but no induction of either CD25 or GM-CSF by Northern blotting. This pattern corresponded to the activation of an egr-1 but not a GM-CSF promoter-driven reporter construct in transient gene expression assays. In DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), nuclear extract from J3.9 cells has significantly increased binding to CRE and SRE but not nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B) DNA oligos, as compared to J-Neo cell extract. These results suggest that low level expression of pX and env region gene products in Jurkat T-cells stimulates persistent activation of CRE- and SRE- but not NF kappa B-induced cellular genes.","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90095-1678, USA.']",,"['K11 CA01566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA61545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of cells formed during haemopoiesis are destined to die by apoptosis before they are fully differentiated, and homeostasis of cell number is maintained by a balance between mitosis and apoptosis. Many haematological malignancies are associated with changes in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis, which may be a direct or an indirect effect. Genetic mutations that prevent cell death cause cells to accumulate and can eventually lead to malignancy. Alternatively, oncogenic mutations that lead to increased cell production can indirectly cause a decrease in apoptosis in some populations and an increase in others. Chemotherapeutic drugs may kill cells directly, or indirectly by inducing apoptosis as a stress response. Therapeutic strategies are evolving to increase the propensity of malignant cells to die by either means and to mitigate side effects by reducing apoptosis in non-malignant cells.","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",,,68,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus it is important to investigate the regulation of ARE-mediated mRNA decay in a variety of mammalian cells in different physiological states. The tetracycline (Tet)-regulatory promoter system appears appropriate for these investigations. However, we found that efficient degradation of mRNAs bearing different AREs cannot be observed simply by blocking constitutive transcription from the Tet-regulated promoter with Tet, possibly due to saturation of the cellular decay machinery. In addition, deadenylation kinetics and their relationship to mRNA decay cannot be adequately measured under these conditions. To overcome these obstacles we have developed a new strategy that employs the Tet-regulated promoter system to achieve a transient burst of transcription that results in synthesis of a population of cytoplasmic mRNAs fairly homogeneous in size. Using this new system we show that ARE-destabilizing function, necessary for down-regulating mRNAs for cytokines, growth factors and transcription factors, is maintained in quiescent or growth-arrested cells as well as in saturation density-arrested NIH 3T3 cells. We also demonstrate that the ARE-mediated decay pathway is conserved between NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and K562 erythroblasts. These in vivo observations support a broader role for AREs in the control of cell growth and differentiation. In addition, we observed that there is a significant difference in deadenylation and decay rates for beta-globin mRNA expressed in these two cell lines. Deadenylation and decay of beta-globin mRNA in K562 cells is extraordinarily slow compared with NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that the increased stability gained by beta-globin mRNA in K562 cells is mainly controlled at the deadenylation step. Our strategy for studying mammalian mRNA turnover now permits a more general application to different cell lines harboring the Tet-regulated system under various physiological conditions.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas Houston Health Science Center, Medical School, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,['GM-46454/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC147286,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast with the closely related HTLV-1, which is associated with both leukemia and neurologic disorders, HTLV-2 lacks a strong etiologic association with disease. HTLV-2 does shares many properties with HTLV-1, including in vitro lymphocyte transformation capability. To better assess the ability of HTLV-2 to transform lymphocytes, a limiting dilution assay was used to generate clonal, transformed lymphocyte lines. As with HTLV-1, the transformation efficiency of HTLV-2 producer cells was proportionately related to the number of lethally irradiated input cells and was comparable to HTLV-1-mediated transformation efficiency. HTLV-2-infected cells were reproducibly isolated and had markedly increased growth potential compared to uninfected cells; HTLV-2 transformants required the continued presence of exogenous interleukin 2 for growth for several months and were maintained for over 2 years in culture. All HTLV-2-transformed populations were CD2 and/or CD3 positive and B1 negative and were either CD4+ or CD8+ populations or a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. Clonality of the HTLV-2 transformants was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of T-cell receptor beta chain rearrangement. Southern blot analysis revealed a range of integrated full-length genomes from one to multiple.

To address the functional significance of these host proteins, murine leukemia viruses containing the cellular receptors for Rous sarcoma virus (Tva) or ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MCAT-1) were produced. These receptor-pseudotyped viruses efficiently infect cells expressing the cognate viral envelope glycoproteins, with titers of up to 10(5) infectious units per milliliter for the Tva pseudotypes. Receptor and viral glycoprotein specificity and functional requirements are maintained, suggesting that receptor pseudotype infection recapitulates events of normal viral entry. The ability of the Tva and MCAT-1 pseudotypes to infect cells efficiently suggests that, in contrast to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 entry, neither of these retroviral receptors requires a coreceptor for membrane fusion. In addition, the ability of receptor pseudotypes to target infected cells suggests that they may be useful therapeutic reagents for directing infection of viral vectors. Receptor-pseudotyped viruses may be useful for identifying new viral receptors or for defining functional requirements of known receptors. Moreover, this work suggests that the production of receptor pseudotypes in vivo could provide a mechanism for expanded viral tropism with potential effects on the pathogenesis and evolution of the virus.","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104-4318, USA.']",,"['T32 AI007325/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AI-07325/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC109421,,,,,,,,,,

The HTLV-1 transactivator protein, Tax, is believed to be crucial for the development of the disease since it is transforming in vitro and induces tumors in transgenic animals. Although the transcriptional modulation of viral and cellular gene expression by Tax has been analyzed thoroughly, it has remained unclear how the Tax functions act on the cell cycle of primary T cells. To investigate the mechanism of Tax-mediated T-cell stimulation, we transduced primary human cord blood T cells with a conditional, tetracycline repressor-based tax expression system. Permanent Tax expression results in an abnormal proliferation of T cells which closely resemble HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes. Suppression of Tax synthesis stopped lymphocyte growth and caused cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Upon reinduction of tax expression, the arrested cells entered the S phase. This showed that Tax has mitogenic activity, which is required for stimulating the G1- to S-phase transition of immortalized lymphocytes. In mammalian cells, the G1-phase progression is controlled by the serial activation of several cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), starting with Cdk4 and Cdk6. In the presence of Tax, both Cdk4 and Cdk6 were activated. The suppression of Tax synthesis, however, resulted in a significant reduction of the Cdk4 and Cdk6 activities but did not influence the expression of Cdk4, Cdk6, or cognate D-type cyclin proteins. These data suggest that Tax induces Cdk4 and Cdk6 activity in primary human T lymphocytes; this Cdk activation is likely to account for the mitogenic Tax effect and for the abnormal T-cell proliferation of HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes.","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie der Friedrich-Alexander Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germany.']",,,,,PMC109417,,,,,,,,,,

AP-3 and all other related adaptor protein complexes have been shown to be associated with intracellular vesicles but not with the cell surface.

Since cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) induce apoptosis of infected cells as part of the ""lethal hit,"" inhibition of apoptosis could represent an effective immune evasion strategy. We report here herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) interference with CTL-induced apoptosis of infected cells and show that HSV-1 inhibits the nuclear manifestations of apoptosis but not the membrane changes. The HL-60 cell line (human promyelocytic leukemia) undergoes apoptosis in response to many stimuli, including incubation with ethanol. After HSV-1 infection (strains E115 and 17+), ethanol-treated cells did not produce oligonucleosomal DNA fragments characteristic of apoptosis, as assayed by gel electrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Inhibition was detected 2 h after infection and increased over time. Importantly, HSV-1-infected cells were resistant to apoptosis induced by antigen-specific CD4+ CTL, despite the fact that CTL recognition and degranulation in response to infected targets remained intact. Unlike HSV-1, HSV-2 (strains 333 and HG52) did not inhibit DNA fragmentation. In contrast to the inhibition of DNA fragmentation by HSV-1, none of the HSV-1 or -2 strains interfered with the ethanol-induced exposure of surface phosphatidylserine characteristic of apoptosis, as determined by annexin V binding. These results demonstrate that genes of HSV-1 inhibit the nuclear manifestations of apoptosis but not the membrane manifestations, suggesting that these may be mediated via separate pathways. They also suggest that HSV-1 inhibition of CTL-induced apoptosis may be an important mechanism of immune evasion.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",,"['P01 AI034616/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI34616/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC109392,,,,,,,,,,

Substitution was compatible with envelope processing, transport, and incorporation into virions. However, three substitution mutants showed a temperature-dependent phenotype, suggesting structural unstability. Accessibility of the tagging epitope for a monoclonal anti-VSV-G antibody was greater in oligomeric than in monomeric SUs when insertion was done in VRA, a domain essential for receptor recognition. In contrast, accessibility was independent of structural constraints when insertion was done in VRB, a domain playing an accessory role in receptor binding. Interaction with the amphotropic receptor was investigated by interference assay and study of binding and infection of target cells with MLV particles coated with the substituted envelopes. Envelope-receptor interaction was abolished when substitution was performed in a potential loop-forming segment located at the N-terminal half of VRA. Although interaction was affected to variable extents, depending on the substituted segment, other mutants conserved the ability to interact with the amphotropic receptor. These experiments indicate the 14-amino-acid segment between positions 50 and 64 of SU as an essential determinant of amphotropic-receptor recognition. They also show that a foreign linear epitope can be tolerated in several locations of the amphotropic SU receptor binding site, and this result has implications for the design of targeted retroviral vectors.","['Laboratoire Retrovirus et Transfert Genetique, CNRS URA 1157, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",,,,,PMC109391,,,,,,,,,,

When expressed separately, L1, the major capsid protein, showed a diffuse nuclear distribution while L2, the minor capsid protein, was found to localize to punctate nuclear regions identified as promonocytic leukemia protein (PML) oncogenic domains (PODs). Coexpression of L1 and L2 induced a relocation of L1 into the PODs, leading to the colocalization of L1 and L2. The effect of L2 expression on the distribution of the nonstructural viral proteins E1 and E2, which are required for maintenance of the genome and viral DNA synthesis, was also examined. The localization of the E1 protein was unaffected by L2 expression. However, the pattern of anti-E2 staining was dramatically altered in L2-expressing cells. Similar to L1, E2 was shifted from a dispersed nuclear locality into the PODs and colocalized with L2. The recruitment of full-length E2 by L2 occurred in the absence of other viral components. L2 was shown previously to be essential for the generation of infectious BPV. Our present results provide evidence for a role for L2 in the organization of virion components by recruiting them to a distinct nuclear domain. This L2-dependent colocalization probably serves as a mechanism to promote the assembly of papillomaviruses either by increasing the local concentration of virion constituents or by providing the physical architecture necessary for efficient packaging and assembly. The data also suggest a role for a nonstructural viral protein, E2, in virion assembly, specifically the recruitment of the viral genome to the sites of assembly, through its high-affinity interaction with specific sequences in the viral DNA.","['Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",,,,,PMC109358,,,,,,,,,,

The authors present a retrospective review of six children who developed cerebral cavernous malformations after they underwent radiation treatment for central nervous system (CNS) neoplasia and propose two possible models to explain the formation of cavernous malformations. METHODS: Three boys, aged 13, 9, and 17 years, suffered intracerebral hemorrhages from cerebral cavernous malformations 87, 94, and 120 months, respectively, after they received whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) for acute lymphocytic leukemia. A 10-year-old girl and a 19-year-old man developed temporal lobe cavernous malformations 46 and 48 months, respectively, after they received radiation therapy for posterior fossa astrocytomas. A 12-year-old girl developed a temporal lobe cavernous malformation 45 months after WBRT was administered for a medulloblastoma. In all of these cases the cavernous malformation appeared in the irradiated field, was not known to be present prior to radiation therapy, and developed after a latency period following treatment. The incidence of cavernous malformations in these patients suggests that children who undergo radiation therapy of the brain may have an increased risk of hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Two possible models may explain the formation of cavernous malformations following brain radiation in these patients. First, the cavernous malformations may form de novo in response to the radiation. Second, the cavernous malformations may have been present, but radiographically occult, at the time of radiation therapy and may have hemorrhaged in response to the radiation. The authors conclude that cavernous malformations may develop after brain radiation and propose a possible mechanism for this formation.","['Department of Neurosurgery, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Ohio 45267-0515, USA.']",['J Neurosurg. 1998 Jul;89(1):167-9.

The temporal and dose-dependent effects of murine rLIF (mrLIF) and human rLIF (hrLIF) on embryo development in two different mouse strains were investigated in this work. METHODS: Two-cell embryos were recovered from the fallopian tubes of superovulated/mated females and cultured in Krebs medium plus bovine serum albumin in microdroplets under oil. RESULTS: In the B6CBF1 strain, mrLIF significantly stimulated blastocyst formation and decreased embryo fragmentation/degeneration when added simultaneously at the initiation of culture or 24 hours thereafter. Human rLIF also had a positive effect on development. In the CD1 strain (lower fecundity), mrLIF dose-dependent effects were observed, with enhanced developmental stimulation achieved with higher doses. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that hrLIF stimulates mouse embryo development in vitro and that different mouse strains show distinct responses to the cytokine. In addition, mrLIF enhances blastocyst formation and decreases embryo fragmentation when added to the embryo culture as early as the two-cell stage.","['Department of Biological Sciences, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Available data suggest that the cells responsible for the cytolytic activity are at least in part CD8+ and HLA restricted in their function. Additional data suggest that some anti-CML cellular activity may be Fas mediated. T-cell receptor studies provide evidence for an oligoclonal response implying a recognition of a limited number of antigens. We have used culture techniques similar to those used for CML to study the ability of AML cells to differentiate toward dendritic cells.

This multiprotein replication complex contains DNA polymerases alpha and delta, primase, replication factor C, replication protein A, helicase, poly(ADPribose) polymerase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, DNA ligase I, and topoisomerases I and II. Recently, the HeLa cell-derived DNA synthesome was identified as a discrete high molecular weight protein band in native polyacrylamide gels. Here, we report our findings regarding the change in the organizational status of the DNA synthesome when HL-60 cells undergo either terminal differentiation or temporary G1 growth arrest. We observed that the HL-60 cell DNA synthesome also migrates as a discrete high molecular weight protein band in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. This high molecular weight protein band was present in nuclei derived from both actively cycling cells and aphidicolin-arrested cells but was absent in TPA-induced terminally differentiated cells. We also found that DNA polymerase delta, replication factor C, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen are absent in cells that are induced to differentiate in response to 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate treatment but are present in actively cycling cells. The level of replication protein A in differentiated cells was similar to that of cycling cells, whereas the level of annexin I, a cytoskeleton protein, is higher in differentiated cells than it is in actively cycling cells. We conclude that the DNA synthesome remains integrated and inactive in temporarily growth-arrested cells but is disassembled in differentiated cells. Furthermore, we conclude that disassembly of the organized replication complex is a specific cellular event in the process of permanent cell cycle exit and that the process leading to disassembly may be regulated, in part, at the level of gene transcription.","['Toxicology Programs, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore 21201, USA.']",,"['CA 57350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 65754/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using a unique centrifugation-based cell adhesion assay and affinity chromatography of the cell surface-labeled integrins, we show in this study that the constitutive alpha(5) beta(1)-dependent attachment of three leukemic cell lines, BV-173, K562, and Nalm-6, to FN or to a 110-kDa central cell-binding fragment of FN was totally inhibited at 37 degrees C by preincubation of the substrate with either antibodies to the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-containing region (3Fn-9 module) or to the synergistic region (3Fn-9 module) of FN. Similar results were obtained when assays were carried out at 4 degrees C, suggesting that energy-dependent events were not involved. On the other hand, only the antibody against the 3Fn-10 module was able to detach most firmly adherent cells. Constitutive cell attachment to the 110-kDa fragment was cation dependent, with the order of efficacy of the cation being Mn2+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+, and Ca2+ was only effective for BV-173 cells. Antibodies against the alpha(5) beta(1) integrin or the alpha(5) subunit completely impaired cell attachment of all cell lines, whereas several blocking anti-beta(1) subunit antibodies, including 4B4, P4C10, and AIIB2, differentially perturbed cell adhesion of BV-173, depending on which cation was present. These anti-beta(1) blocking antibodies, whose epitopes map to a region distant from the one expected to contain the beta(1) putative cation binding sites, seemed to lock the higher activation state of this integrin attained in the presence of Mg2+ and to preserve it during the subsequent adhesion events irrespectively of the presence of the low avidity state-inducing Ca2+ ion. Because the higher binding avidity displayed by BV-173 could not be explained by a higher degree of preclustering of alpha(5) beta(1) integrin in this cell line compared to K562, these findings suggest that cations might act as allosteric activators of integrin function. Whether this novel cation-dependent parameter of alpha(5) beta(1) integrin-FN interaction might contribute to the growth control and/or tissue dissemination of leukemic cells remains to be determined.","['Divisione di Oncologia Sperimentale 2, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Aviano, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent gene disruption experiments demonstrated that Epo receptor signaling is not an obligatory step in erythroid differentiation. Here, we describe the role of Epo in proliferation, terminal differentiation, and apoptosis in a novel human Epo-dependent cell line, AS-E2. Upon withdrawal of Epo, the cells ceased to proliferate and underwent apoptotic death. Accompanying this cell death, an increase in the number of hemoglobin-positive cells of approximately 2-fold was observed. This was associated with immediate up-regulation of the GATA-1:GATA-2 ratio and down-regulation of Bcl-xL. Treatment with Epo or 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) up-regulated expression of GATA-2 and Bcl-xL, and these elevations were inhibited by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), H7 and H8.

GFD8 cells are dependent for growth on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and differentiate in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). We have stably transfected this cell line with constructs constitutively expressing c-Myb or B-Myb. Deregulated expression of both c-Myb and B-Myb inhibited the differentiation observed in response to PMA and, in particular, the induction of the CD11b and CD11c antigens on the cell surface, and the induction of adherence. Furthermore, c-Myb and B-Myb enhanced expression of CD13 upon PMA treatment. Although deregulated Myb expression did not alter the growth factor dependence of the cells, it led to an increase in G2 relative to G1 arrest in cells induced to differentiate in response to PMA, whereas control vector-transfected cells were blocked mostly in G1. This decrease in G1 block took place despite normal induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein p21 (CIP1/WAF1). Thus, GFD8 cells stably expressing the human B-Myb protein behaved in a manner indistinguishable from those stably expressing C-Myb for both differentiation and cell cycle parameters. In agreement with these findings and differently from most previous reports, transactivation assays show that B-myb can indeed act as a strong activator of transcription. Finally, we demonstrated that although the DNA-binding domain of c-myb is required for both the differentiation block and the shift in cell cycle after PMA treatment, phosphorylation by casein kinase II and mitogen-activated protein kinase at positions 11 and 12 or 532 of c-myb, respectively, are not. We conclude that c-Myb and B-Myb may activate a common cellular program in the GFD8 cell line involved in both differentiation and cell cycle control.","['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Istituto Ricerche Farmacologicalhe, Mario Negri, Milano, Italy.']",,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70909/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer risk in the offspring was increased about 1.10 times when the father had cancer, whereas no increase was noted when the mother had cancer. If both parents had cancer, the risk for sons was 1.39 and for daughters, 1.34. Familial aggregation between parents and offspring was observed for 5 concordant and 14 discordant cancer sites and 10 parental sites at which all cancer was increased in the offspring. The concordant sites between the parent and offspring were colorectum, breast, melanoma, skin (squamous cell carcinoma), and thyroid. The aggregation at discordant sites in the parents and the offspring included stomach-breast, colorectum-salivary glands, colorectum-breast, colorectum-lymphoma, colorectum-leukemia, liver-breast, pancreas-breast, breast-melanoma, ovary-breast, prostate-breast, prostate-cervix, prostate-multiple myeloma, kidney-melanoma, and nervous tissue-melanoma. In most of these combinations, cancer in the second parent increased the risk to the offspring. The present results on young and middle-aged adults suggest that cancer in both parents increases cancer risk in the offspring at many sites. Chance and environmental effects may explain some of the results, whereas true genetic factors probably contribute to most of the findings. The molecular genetic explanation may be that rare dominant single genes increase susceptibility at many sites or that overlapping sets of genes control susceptibility at multiple sites.","['Department of Biosciences at Novum Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden. kari.kemminki@cnt.ki.se']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation replaces the C terminus, including the transactivation domain of AML-1B, with ETO, a nuclear protein of unknown function. We previously showed that AML-1-ETO is a dominant inhibitor of AML-1B-dependent transcriptional activation. Here we demonstrate that AML-1-ETO also inhibits C/EBP-alpha-dependent activation of the myeloid cell-specific, rat defensin NP-3 promoter. AML-1B bound the core enhancer motifs present in the NP-3 promoter and activated transcription approximately sixfold. Similarly, C/EBP-alpha bound NP-3 promoter sequences and activated transcription approximately sixfold. Coexpression of C/EBP-alpha with AML-1B or its family members, AML-2 and murine AML-3, synergistically activated the NP-3 promoter up to 60-fold. The t(8;21) product, AML-1-ETO, repressed AML-1B-dependent activation of NP-3 and completely inhibited C/EBP-alpha-dependent activity as well as the synergistic activation. In contrast, the inv(16) product, which indirectly targets AML family members by fusing their heterodimeric DNA binding partner, CBF-beta, to the myosin heavy chain, inhibited AML-1B but not C/EBP-alpha activation or the synergistic activation. AML-1-ETO and C/EBP-alpha were coimmunoprecipitated and thus physically interact in vivo. Deletion mutants demonstrated that the C terminus of ETO was required for AML-1-ETO-mediated repression of the synergistic activation but not for association with C/EBP-alpha. Finally, overexpression of AML-1-ETO in myeloid progenitor cells prevented granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced differentiation. Thus, AML-1-ETO may contribute to leukemogenesis by specifically inhibiting C/EBP-alpha- and AML-1B-dependent activation of myeloid promoters and blocking differentiation.","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.']",,"['CA77274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC121499,,,,,,,,,,

Two of these partners, ENL and AF9, code for proteins that are highly similar to each other and as fusions with HRX induce myeloid leukemias in mice as demonstrated by retroviral gene transfer and knock-in experiments, respectively. In the present study, a structure-function analysis was performed to determine the molecular requirements for in vitro immortalization of murine myeloid cells by HRX-ENL. Deletions of either the AT hook motifs or the methyltransferase homology domain of HRX substantially impaired the transforming effects of HRX-ENL. The methyltransferase homology domain was shown to bind non-sequence specifically to DNA in vitro, providing evidence that the full transforming activity of HRX-ENL requires multiple DNA binding structures in HRX. The carboxy-terminal 84 amino acids of ENL, which encode two predicted helical structures highly conserved in AF9, were necessary and sufficient for transformation when they were fused to HRX. Similarly, mutations that deleted one or both of these conserved helices completely abrogated the transcriptional activation properties of ENL. This finding correlates, for the first time, a biological function of an HRX fusion partner with the transforming activity of the chimeric proteins. Our studies support a model in which HRX-ENL induces myeloid transformation by deregulating subordinate genes through a gain of function contributed by the transcriptional effector properties of ENL.","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305, USA.']",,['CA55029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC121463,,,,,,,,,,

These vectors contain the long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) and a reporter gene (neo or lacZ) regulated by the LTR sequence of rous sarcoma virus (RSV). Because these pseudotyped retroviral vectors contain the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein (VSV-G), they have an extremely broad host cell range and can infect many no mammalian species. Newly fertilized medaka eggs (intact or dechorionated) were electroporated at different voltage settings in the presence of 4 x 10(4) cfu of pantropic retroviral vector. The survival rates of the pantropic retroviral vector-treated embryos ranged from 65% to 20% with increasing amplitude of electroporation. Dechorionation did not substantially affect the survival rate of embryos. PCR amplification demonstrated proviral sequences in up to 60% of the 2-month-old fish. The efficiency of gene transfer was enhanced by dechorionation. Furthermore, overnight incubation of dechorionated embryos with pantropic retroviral vectors without electroporation also resulted in proviral integration in 60% of the embryos without compromising survival rate. Southern blot analysis of DNA samples isolated from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as positive F1 reaction animals confirmed the integration of a single copy of the provirus into the host genome. Three P1 transgenic females transmitted the proviral sequence to 50% of their F1 progeny in a back cross with wild-type males, suggesting that the entire germline of these P1 fish was transformed by the pantropic retroviral vector. Expression of the neomycin phosphotranferase transgene in F1 transgenic individuals was detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR amplification of the neo mRNA sequence. Furthermore, expression of a beta-galactosidase transgene was also observed in 4-day-old F1 transgenic individuals. Thus, pantropic retroviral vectors provide a convenient method to stably introduce and express foreign genes in medaka.","['Center of Marine Biotechnology, University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, USA.']",,['R01-RR11680-02/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe the detection of a soluble form of CD48 in plasma and serum. Its level was quantified by an immunoenzymometric assay (IEMA) specific for soluble CD48. While soluble CD48 was detected in the plasma of healthy individuals (median = 29 ng/ml; range, 15-48 ng/ml), elevated levels were detected in some patients with lymphoproliferative disease (median = 41 ng/ml; range, 9-213 ng/ml, arthritis (median = 42 ng/ml; range, 13-67 ng/ml), and acute EBV infection (174 ng/ml). Soluble CD48 was also detectable in tissue culture supernatants from the Raji lymphoid cell line. The mechanism of CD48 release from cells is unclear. The finding of significant levels of soluble CD48 in plasma and the development of a sensitive IEMA for its measurement will facilitate further studies on its normal function and its role in disease.","['CRC for Biopharmaceutical Research Ltd., St. Vincents Hospital, Darlinghurst, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When starved of amino acids, nuclear bodies reversibly form one or more doughnut-shaped large bodies in T24 cells. Here, I present evidence that cystine is essential for the maintenance of normal-sized nuclear bodies: Cystine deficiency induces the formation of large bodies, and the addition of cystine or cysteine induces the reappearance of many normal-sized nuclear bodies. Both PML and Sp100 exhibit the same behavior as that of the nuclear body antigen(s) of AP435 MAb with regard to these changes, L-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, also induced the formation of large bodies that could be reversed to nuclear bodies by both beta-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol as well as cystine. Large bodies have the characteristic electron-dense, spherical, and concentric or reticulated features of nuclear bodies as observed by electron microscopy. The results indicate that environmental cystine controls reversible change between nuclear bodies and large bodies, which are not mere aggregates of nuclear bodies, but rather reconstituted nuclear bodies.","['Laboratory of Life Science and Biomolecular Engineering, Japan Tobacco, Inc., Yokohama, Japan. kamei@tcrl.jti.co.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A cause-effect relationship between these two parameters was established by showing that: (a) rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I, abolished respiration and prevented the enhancement of the DNA-damaging response under all the above circumstances; (b) the membrane-impermeant, complex I-activating substrate L-malate gave similar results in permeabilized cells; and (c) none of the NADH-linked substrates affected the DNA-damaging response to tert-butylhydroperoxide in respiration-deficient cells. Stimulation of electron transport potentiated the DNA-cleaving ability of tert-butylhydroperoxide via a process involving enforced mitochondrial calcium accumulation in the absence of a discernible elevation in the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+. Finally, mitochondrial calcium was found to promote the mitochondrial formation of DNA-damaging levels of hydrogen peroxide. In conclusion, the data herein presented define a previously unexpected role of respiratory substrates in the control of the deleterious effects of an organic hydroperoxide at the level of genomic DNA. The enhanced DNA cleavage mediated by NADH-linked substrates in response to tert-butylhydroperoxide would appear to depend on a sequence of events involving stimulation of electron transport, mitochondrial accumulation of Ca2+, and mitochondrial formation of DNA-damaging levels of hydrogen peroxide via a Ca(2+)-dependent process.","['Istituto di Farmacologia e Farmacognosia, Universita di Urbino, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its expression in these cells types has not been directly linked to corresponding cell types in vivo. In this report, expression of HC gp-39 is demonstrated from peripheral blood-derived macrophages in association with their differentiation from monocytes to macrophages. Consistent with macrophage specificity, HC gp-39 expression is also induced upon selective stimulation of the pluripotent promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 toward the monocyte/macrophage lineage with vitamin D3 or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), while treatments stimulating granulocyte and eosinophilic pathways do not induce expression. Furthermore, HC gp-39 expression levels correlate with the degree of morphological differentiation induced by PMA and vitamin D3 treatments. PMA-induced mRNA expression occurs by 36 h and is a secondary transcriptional response since its synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide. Apparently, HC gp-39 expression is tied to later events in the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. The in vivo significance of these results is validated by the in situ detection of HC gp-39 mRNA in inflammatory macrophages associated with rheumatoid synovium. Thus, macrophages appear to be an important source of HC gp-39, which has been shown to be present at elevated levels in the blood and synovium of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The implications of this extend well beyond the previously restricted observations in cell types associated with the joint and suggest a potential involvement of macrophage-derived HC gp-39 in other aspects of inflammation, tissue remodeling, and host defense.","['Department of Gene Expression Sciences, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients who were receiving induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia were randomly assigned to receive one of four types of platelets transfusions: unmodified, pooled platelet concentrates from random donors (control); filtered, pooled platelet concentrates from random donors (F-PC); ultraviolet B-irradiated, pooled platelet concentrates from random donors (UVB-PC); or filtered platelets obtained by apheresis from single random donors (F-AP). All patients received transfusions of filtered, leukocyte-reduced red cells. RESULTS: Of 530 patients with no alloantibodies at base line, 13 percent of those in the control group produced lymphocytotoxic antibodies and their thrombocytopenia became refractory to platelet transfusions, as compared with 3 percent in the F-PC group, 5 percent in the UVB-PC group, and 4 percent in the F-AP group (P< or =0.03 for each treated group as compared with the controls; there were no significant differences among the treated groups). Lymphocytotoxic antibodies were found in 45 percent of the controls, as compared with 17 to 21 percent in the treated groups (P<0.001 for each treated group as compared with the controls; there were no significant differences among the treated groups). Antibodies against platelet glycoproteins developed in 6 to 11 percent of the patients, with no significant differences among the four groups. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of leukocytes by filtration and ultraviolet B irradiation of platelets are equally effective in preventing alloantibody-mediated refractoriness to platelets during chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia.

Aspergillus fumigatus is supposed to have been responsible for the invasive mycosis. The etiopathological significance of Ch. homopilatum remained unclear. The isolation of Ch. homopilatum was a reason for reviewing the genus Chaetomium. In the literature 18 reported cases of infections by Chaetomium sp. were found. Ch. globosum was the most prevalent species and caused mostly onychomycosis. Ch. strumarium and Ch. atrobrunneum caused brain infections. The predisposing factor in case of onychomycosis and cutaneous lesions was a trauma, and the systemic mycoses were a consequence of leukaemia, renal transplantation, intravenous drug use or renal failure. The reported cases show, that Chaetomium sp. may cause infections, if predisposing factors are present. Therefore the isolation of Chaetomium sp. in clinical specimen should not regarded as a contamination, and the possible etiopathological significance should be clarified.","['Landesinstitut fur den Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienst, Munster, BR Deutschland.']",,,19,,,Aspergillus fumigatus und Chaetomium homopilatum bei einem Leukamiepatienten.

Parallel to the diminished selenium status the plasma glutathione peroxidase activity (Gpx) was not reduced as it is in selenium deficiency, but markedly elevated and probably reflecting cytolytic processes. In the group of combined conditioning (fractionated total body irradiation plus chemotherapy) we found significantly more elevated plasma Gpx values in comparison to the only-chemotherapy group. The renal selenium excretion was elevated during the whole observation and could be caused by disturbed tubular function. CONCLUSION: We conclude, that in the situation of BMT a selenium substitution in a dosage of at least 1 to 2 micrograms Se/kg/d is necessary.

This study examined the ability of the drug to damage cellular DNA, induce apoptosis, and affect the cell cycle of CEM human leukemia cells. No bifunctional lesions, interstrand DNA cross-links or DNA-protein cross-links were seen (by alkaline sedimentation and K+/SDS precipitation, respectively) when using up to 50 microM HMAF. The drug possibly formed some monoadducts, as DNA from drug-treated cells impeded primer extension by Taq polymerase, although only partial inhibition was seen even at 200 microM HMAF. HMAF also induced secondary lesions in cellular DNA, single-strand breaks that were detectable (by nucleoid sedimentation and alkaline sucrose gradient analysis) after a 4-hr treatment at HMAF levels as low as 2 microM, comparable to the growth inhibition IC50 value (1.7 microM). A post-treatment incubation of cells in drug-free medium generated substantial amounts of DNA double-stranded fragments of several kbp, suggesting apoptotic fragmentation (>30% of total DNA following treatment with 20 microM HMAF and a 17-hr post-treatment incubation). Chromatin condensation (by ultrastructural analysis) and induction of sub-G1 particles and apoptotic strand breakage (by multiparametric flow cytometry) confirmed induction of apoptosis by HMAF. HMAF preferentially inhibited DNA synthesis (IC50 approximately 2 microM), which is consistent with an S phase block, observed by cell cycle analysis. The pattern of apoptotic DNA fragmentation, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and blockage in the S phase suggests that these events play a role in the antiproliferative activity of HMAF.","['Cancer Therapy and Research Center, San Antonio, TX 78245-3217, USA. jan@jerry.iddw.saci.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We examined the levels of OSM in the synovial fluids of patients with arthritis by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA of cell culture supernatants and Northern blots were used to assess responses of HSF to interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), OSM, and other members of the IL-6/leukemia inhibitory factor (IL-6/LIF) family of cytokines. RESULTS: We detected variable levels of OSM antigen in 9 of 10 RA patient synovial fluids, but levels were not detectable in 9 of 10 osteoarthritis (OA) patient fluids. Upon examining the responses of HSF in culture, OSM stimulated monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), whereas RANTES secretion (regulated upon activation, normal T expressed and presumably secreted) was not altered by OSM alone. In IL-1alpha-induced cells, OSM costimulation further enhanced MCP-1 release, but inhibited the release of RANTES and IL-8. Other members of the IL-6/LIF family of cytokines did not show these effects. OSM induced a small elevation of MMP-1 production over 2 and 3 days of stimulation (2-fold), and acted significantly to enhance IL-1alpha-induced production of MMP-1 (to 8-fold and 9-fold at 48 and 72 hours, respectively).

METHODS: We introduced 2 hammerhead ribozymes targeted against HTLV-I tax/rex mRNA into synovial cells obtained from patients with HAAP and from patients with HTLV-I-negative rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and examined the ribozyme-mediated ablation of Tax expression. Using standard methods, we also determined the cells' ability to stop proliferating and to undergo apoptosis. RESULTS: The ribozymes successfully cleaved tax/rex mRNA in HAAP patient synoviocytes. Both tax mRNA expression and Tax protein synthesis were inhibited significantly, resulting in inhibition of synovial cell growth and induction of apoptosis. In contrast, synovial cells from RA patients were not affected.

Unexpectedly however, transgenic mice carrying scl coupled to the human T-cell specific CD2 enhancer (CD2-scl) did not spontaneously develop T-cell lymphomas despite high levels of scl expression in their thymocytes. Analogous to other transgenic models of lymphomagenesis, it is likely that additional genetic abnormalities are required to cooperate with scl to trigger lymphomagenesis. Two possible candidates are the p53 and N-ras genes which are mutated in some cases of T-ALL, particularly in relapsed disease. Therefore, we examined lymphomagenesis in the progeny of CD2-scl mice crossed with N-ras transgenic mice or p53 deficient. Surprisingly, the frequency of lymphomas in the p53 nullizygous or N-ras transgenic mice was not enhanced by expression of the scl transgene. In fact, expression of scl in both genetic backgrounds paradoxically reduced the frequency of thymic lymphomas and, at least in the p53 nullizygous mice, shifted the pattern of organ involvement to the peripheral lymphoid organs. In contrast, CD2-scl transgene expression accelerated lymphomagenesis in p53 heterozygous mice. These data suggest that the collaborative effects of scl with N-ras or p53 vary according to the developmental stage of the T-cell.","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",,['CA43540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that the v-MybL3,4A mutant, in which Leu325 and Leu332 of the leucine zipper have been replaced by alanines, failed to induce leukemia in virus infected chicken. This demonstrates that the leucine zipper domain is indispensable for v-myb induced leukemogenesis in vivo. v-MybL3,4A was, however, still able to transform myelomonocytic cells from chicken bone marrow in vitro. Yet, while v-mybL3,4A transformed cells were impaired in growth at 37 degrees C, they failed to grow at 42 degrees C, the physiological body temperature of avian species. This might explain the loss of v-MybL3,4A leukemogenic potential in vivo. We also demonstrate that the v-Myb leucine zipper domain interacts in vitro with two host cell proteins, p26 and p28. This interaction is compromised in v-MybL3,4A indicating that binding of v-Myb to p26 and p28 might be important for the leukemogenic potential of v-Myb.","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we demonstrate p56lck is also expressed in colon tumour biopsies due predominantly or exclusively to the use of the lck type I promoter. In T leukaemia lines, the lck type I promoter requires binding sites for both Ets- and Myb-related transcription factors. In contrast, in colon tumour lines the activation of the lck type I promoter requires the Ets but not the Myb binding site. In these lines, a consensus binding site for HMG-related transcription factors, AACAAAG, is required for efficient lck type I promoter activity. Sox-4 is a candidate transcription factor for binding and activating the lck type l promoter in colon carcinoma cells. Co-expression of Ets-1 and Sox-4, but neither protein alone, was sufficient to activate the lck type l promoter in HeLa cells which do not normally express lck transcripts. These results suggest that aberrant expression of p56lck from the lck type l promoter in colon carcinoma arises from transcriptional activation mediated by Ets- and HMG-related transcription factors.","['The AMGEN Research Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The latest Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer incidence and mortality datasets with the current (DS86) dosimetry system are analysed using generalized relative risk models and generalized absolute risk models, both with and without recently indicated adjustments to the Hiroshima DS86 neutron dose estimates. RESULTS: Without adjustments to the Hiroshima neutron doses, the best estimate of neutron relative biological effectiveness for all tumours in the incidence data is 63.3 (95% CI < 0-275.3) when a generalized relative risk model is used; when a generalized absolute risk model is used in the incidence data the best estimate is 53.5 (95% CI < 0-201.0); when a generalized relative risk model is used in the mortality data, the best estimate is 287.7 (95% CI 38.0- > 10[3]). When likely adjustments are made to the Hiroshima neutron doses the best estimate of neutron relative biological effectiveness in the incidence data using a generalized relative risk model is 15.1 (95% CI < 0-51.4); when a generalized absolute risk model is used in the incidence data the best estimate is 9.0 (95% CI < 0-32.9); when a generalized relative risk model is used in the mortality data the best estimate is 55.1 (95% CI 9.5-280.3). Although there are no significant differences between groupings of the solid tumour sites in their estimated neutron relative biological effectiveness, there are indications that the neutron relative biological effectiveness of solid tumours is lower than that of leukaemia, whether or not adjustments are made to the Hiroshima neutron dose estimates. Uncertainties in the likely adjustments to the DS86 Hiroshima neutron and gamma dose estimates as well as uncertainties in the modelling of excess risk in the two cities (Hiroshima and Nagasaki) imply that these findings should be treated with caution. CONCLUSIONS: Likely adjustments to the Hiroshima neutron dose estimates imply a substantial increase in information on neutron relative biological effectiveness. Whether or not adjustments are made to the Hiroshima neutron doses, there are indications of inconsistency between the estimates of neutron relative biological effectiveness for solid tumours and leukaemia. Dosimetric and modelling uncertainties mean that these findings should be treated with caution.","['National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study shows a strong correlation (r = 0.92; p < 0.01) between TF-activation and depression in LPS binding blocked by ETOH in U937 cells. The antagonism by ETOH of LPS binding was not due to a direct extracellular blockade, since ETOH did not affect the affinity of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-LPS or -anti CD14 mAb on U937 cells. After U937 cells were treated with 2 per cent (v/v) ETOH for 3 h, LPS binding was however drastically inhibited as shown by immunostaining with FITC-LPS which was viewed on a confocal laser scanning microscope. The results imply that cellular events of the ETOH effect mediate this inhibition of LPS binding. Anti-CD14 mAb (UCHM-1) inhibited LPS binding in a dose-dependent fashion, revealing a competitive specific binding to the LPS receptor. The results suggest that CD14 plays an important role in the recognition of LPS. FITC-UCHM-1 binding was significantly reduced in the cells pretreated with 2 per cent (v/v) ETOH for 3 h, indicating that ETOH modulates the ability to express CD14. CD14 expression was upregulated by priming with LPS which was offset by ETOH. Acetaldehyde, a possible metabolite of ETOH, was tested with no effect on CD14 expression. Taken together, our results show that ETOH downregulates the recognition of LPS, and suggest that the inhibitory action is likely to be mediated by the depression in CD14 expression which was also accompanied by a significantly altered membrane fluidity. Thus, the antagonism by ETOH of the binding of LPS results in a depression in the LPS-induced TF-activation.","['Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Miami Medical School, FL 33130, USA.']",,['CA14395/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The monosaccharide 2-deoxy-3-[1-(R)-(ethoxycarbonyl)ethyl]- alpha-D-allo-pyranose had the most inhibitory effect on proliferation, with the (S)-enantiomer having less inhibitory effects. The chiral centre at carbon-7 was found to be an important part of the molecule, as 2-deoxy-3-[methoxycarbonyl methyl]-alpha-D-allo-pyranose had greatly decreased anti-proliferative properties in comparison with the parent compound.

Acute exposure of U937 cells to either lipid resulted in loss of proliferative capacity, degradation of genomic DNA, and manifestation of apoptotic cytoarchitecture. Ceramide robustly stimulated p46-JNK1/p54-JNK2 activity and increased expression of c-jun mRNA and c-Jun protein; in contrast, sphingosine moderately stimulated p46-JNK1/p54-JNK2 and failed to modify c-jun/c-Jun expression. Dominant-negative blockade of normal c-Jun activity by transfection with the TAM-67 c-Jun NH2-terminal deletion mutant abolished the lethal actions of ceramide but was without effect on those of sphingosine, indicating that ceramide-related apoptosis is directly dependent on activation of c-Jun, whereas sphingosine-induced cell death proceeds via an unrelated downstream mechanism. Characterization of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in these responses revealed a further functional disparity between the two lipids: basal p42-ERK1/ p44-ERK2 activity was gradually reduced by ceramide but immediately and completely suppressed by sphingosine. Moreover, blockade of the MAPK cascade by the aminomethoxyflavone MEK1 inhibitor PD-98059 unexpectedly activated p46-JNK1/p54-JNK2 and induced apoptosis in a manner qualitatively resembling that of sphingosine. Both lipids sharply increased p38-RK activity; selective pharmacological inhibition of p38-RK by the pyridinyl imidazole SB-203580 failed to mitigate the cytotoxicity associated with either ceramide or sphingosine, suggesting that p38-RK is not essential for lipid-induced apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that reciprocal alterations in the SAPK and MAPK cascades are associated with the apoptotic influence of either lipid inasmuch as (i) ceramide-mediated lethality is primarily associated with strong stimulation of SAPK and weak inhibition of MAPK, whereas (ii) sphingosine-mediated lethality is primarily associated with weak stimulation of SAPK and strong inhibition of MAPK. We therefore propose that leukemic cell survival depends on the maintenance of an imbalance of the outputs from the MAPK and SAPK systems such that the dominant basal influence of the MAPK cascade allows sustained proliferation, whereas acute redirection of this balance toward the SAPK cascade initiates apoptotic cell death.","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA. wjarvis@gems.vcu.edu']",,"['CA09380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL09241/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Endotoxin-free saline (1 ml) containing either 0.5 or 1 microg of rhLIF was injected into the left and right radiocarpal joints of male angora goats. One hour later the right radiocarpal joints were injected with either 1 or 5 microg of naturally occurring mLBP in 1 ml saline, while the left radiocarpal joints (controls) received 1 ml saline vehicle alone. Goat joints were examined for clinical features of inflammation and synovial fluid (SF) was aspirated on Day 0 (before injection) and Days 2 and 6 postinjection. Leukocyte counts and concentrations of keratan sulfate were determined in the SF. Proteoglycan synthesis and proteoglycan content of cartilage was determined ex vivo in cartilage explants obtained at Day 6. RESULTS: Preliminary time course studies in vitro showed that mLBP had to be added to cartilage explant cultures within 1 h of rhLIF for effective antagonism to occur. In joints injected with either 0.5 or 1 microg rhLIF significant increases in swelling, effusion volume, leukocyte counts, and SF keratan sulfate concentrations were observed relative to controls. Statistically significant depressions of ex vivo proteoglycan synthesis and in proteoglycan content of articular cartilage were also observed relative to controls. In joints injected with 1 microg rhLIF followed by 1 microg mLBP, statistically significant improvement was only observed in the rate of ex vivo cartilage proteoglycan synthesis. The observed rate did not differ significantly from that obtained in joints treated with vehicle alone. In contrast, in joints injected with 0.5 microg rhLIF followed by 5 microg mLBP, statistically significant improvement was observed in all variables. Treatment with 5 microg mLBP effectively negated the effects of rhLIF on joint swelling, effusion volume, leukocyte infiltration, and cartilage proteoglycan catabolism. CONCLUSION: Murine LBP has the ability to attenuate the phlogistic effects of rhLIF in radiocarpal joints of goats and also abolishes the stimulatory effect of rhLIF on cartilage proteoglycan catabolism and depression of ex vivo proteoglycan synthesis. These antiinflammatory and chondral effects suggest that a humanized derivative of mLBP could be a clinically useful antagonist for LIF in inflammatory diseases.","['Department of Rheumatology and the Research Centre, Royal Perth Hospital, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a case of cutaneous type ATLL, affecting mainly the skin as a maculopapular eruption, in which some skin biopsies contained epithelioid cell granulomas in the lymphoma cutis (ATLL) lesion. These Lennert's-like epithelioid clusters were also present in lymph nodes, which showed some degree of invasion by the ATLL lymphocytes. Although prognosis of ATLL is generally poor, our patient has had a less aggressive course, with a survival time to date of 13 years. Our findings suggest that the presence of epithelioid granulomata in an ATLL patient may be a manifestation of a host response which confers some protection against the disease progression.

In these analyses, estimates of the excess relative risk are corrected for bias in recorded doses as estimates of organ dose, and confidence intervals reflect uncertainty in the correction factors. For the Hanford data, these procedures did not greatly modify results for all cancer excluding leukemia, but the upper confidence limit for leukemia was increased by about 40%, a difference that is of some importance in comparing worker-based estimates and confidence intervals with estimates that serve as the basis of radiation protection standards. It is argued that aside from taking account of uncertainty in correction factors, no additional corrections are needed to address random errors resulting from variation in exposure energies and geometries. In addition, it is shown that because the larger cumulative doses, which are most influential in dose-response analyses, are the sums of large numbers of independent dosimeter readings, random errors resulting from variation in laboratory measurements are unlikely to be important for epidemiologic purposes. It is hoped that the approaches illustrated in this paper will be applied to future analyses of data from worker studies, especially combined analyses of data from several countries. Taking account of uncertainty in factors that correct for systematic bias will be especially important as uncertainty resulting from sampling variation decreases.","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD 20852, USA.']",,['R01 OH03270/OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, transplant procedures are associated with a high incidence of deleterious long-term complications. This study included 49 children, conditioned according to the Seattle protocols. Follow-up oral examinations were performed 1 year after BMT. Forty risk factors that may have influenced a low stimulated salivary secretion rate (SSSR) were studied. An SSSR < or = 0.5 ml/min, 1 year after BMT was regarded as the event. One year after BMT, the mean SSSR was 0.5 +/- 0.4 ml/min in children conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI) compared to 1.0 +/- 0.5 ml/min in non-irradiated children (P = 0.0013). Significant predictors for low SSSR in multivariate analysis were: conditioning with TBI (P = 0.0023), recipient female sex (P = 0.0121) and recipient seropositivity for between three and four herpes viruses (P = 0.0157).","['Department of Paediatric Dentistry, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 40-50% of normal monocytes were transduced, whereas purified normal resting T cells and B cells were resistant to infection. We showed that 50-80% of primary chronic myeloid leukemia cells (CML, n = 12) were efficiently transduced in contrast to CML, successful transduction of resting primary chronic B lymphocytic leukemia cells required appropriate preactivation of targeted cells. A novel protocol for the efficient transduction of adenovirus into B-CLL cells was presented. We showed that anti-CD40 mAb or CD40 ligand acts in synergy with rhIL-4 to enable the transduction of approximately 50-75% of B-CLL cells (B-CLL, n = 6). Expression of beta-galactosidase in transduced CML cells and B-CLL cells was detected for at least 15 days after transduction.

Triphosphate derivative of 2CdA is commonly considered to be the agent inducing cell apoptosis resulting from inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, DNA polymerases and DNA repair. Recent studies on toxicity of 2CdA showed that the nucleoside possesses inhibitory activity against enzymes which are responsible for metabolism of deoxyadenosine, which suggests that the mechanism of toxicity by 2CdA includes a block in dAdo metabolic pathways which is very important for normal function of immune system cells. The agent under discussion and two other adenosine analogues (i.e. fludarabine and 2'-deoxycoformycin) which exhibit cytotoxicity against dividing and resting lymphocytes revolutionized the treatment of indolent lymphoid malignancies (i.e. chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma and hairy cell leukemia). Particularly, in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine demonstrated excellent efficacy, achieved after a single 7-day course, with an acceptable tolerability profile, suggesting that cladribine is likely to be more effective than other agents recommended in this disease. Preliminary clinical data, extremely encouraging in the case of 2CdA indicate that biomolecular mechanisms of the drug cytotoxicity is worth wide presentation.","['Department of General Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.']",,,59,,,,,,,,,,,,

When mouse macrophages pre-exposed to LPS were restimulated with this agent, reduced tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) responses (desensitization/endotoxin tolerance) were accompanied by increased (priming) nitric oxide (NO) responses. Priming was also inducible with recombinant interferon-beta (IFN-beta). The requirement of TNF-alpha biosynthesis in the LPS-induced priming was also suggested by the observation that both anti-TNF-alpha serum and pentoxifylline inhibited this effect. However, addition of mouse recombinant TNF-alpha (mrTNF-alpha) did not enhance the priming induced by LPS or IFN-beta, and preincubation with mrTNF-alpha alone, or in association with other cytokines produced by macrophages (interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, or leukaemia inhibitory factor), did not induce a priming effect. We found however, that pentoxifylline, which blocked the priming, also decreased the level of membrane-bound TNF-alpha. Furthermore, exposure to compound BB-3103 (a metalloproteinase inhibitor that blocks the processing of membrane-bound TNF-alpha yielding to the secreted cytokine) enhanced the priming effect, the expression of membrane TNF-alpha and the specific binding of LPS. These observations suggest that the membrane form of TNF-alpha is involved in the interaction of LPS with a receptor required for LPS-induced priming.","['Endotoxin Group, URA-1116 of the National Centre for Scientific Research, University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, France.']",,,,,PMC1364067,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenetic cellular mechanism(s) behind this hypersensitivity to cytokines is unknown, but the number of cytokine receptors and the interaction between ligand and receptor are normal in PV. Interest has therefore focused on post-receptor mechanism(s). Haematopoietic cell phosphatase (HCP) is an intracellular tyrosine phosphatase that has been demonstrated to regulate proliferative signals negatively induced by the cytokines mentioned above. Moreover, motheaten mice that genetically lack HCP have an increased amount of erythroid progenitors that are hypersensitive to Epo, and patients with familial polycythaemia have been shown to exhibit a mutation of the Epo receptor gene that includes the docking site for HCP. We therefore studied mRNA expression of HCP in pure populations of CD34+ cells, granulocytes, platelets and lymphocytes from patients with PV, chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) or essential thrombocythemia (ET), as well as healthy controls. Using a polymerase chain reaction analysis employing specific primers for HCP, we failed to detect any abnormalities of HCP expression in PV in any of the cell populations that were examined. Moreover, HCP mRNA expression was similar in ET and CML compared to controls. Finally, Western blot analysis revealed a normal HCP protein content in PV granulocytes and platelets. We therefore conclude that neither an impaired expression of the HCP gene nor a defect in HCP protein synthesis is present in PV, and does not seem to play a role in the aetiology of this disorder.","['Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm Soder Hospital, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated possible pulmonary disturbances in adult de novo AML patients receiving yeast rhGM-CSF 24 h prior to chemotherapy under phase II/III conditions. Eighteen patients were monitored for 22 treatment episodes. GM-CSF was given s.c. 1 q.d., 2 q.d. or continuously i.v. at 250 micrograms/m2/d 24 h prior to induction chemotherapy (TAD9, n = 18) and consolidation (TAD9, n = 4). Spirometry, bodyplethysmography, single breath-diffusion capacity (DLCO) and arterial blood gas analyses were obtained prior to GM-CSF, and repeated after 24 h. Pulse oxymetric oxygen saturation (saO2) was registered continuously for the first 16 h within day 1 of rhGM-CSF treatment. Patients were aged 21-75 years. The saO2 monitoring did not reveal any first dose effect. PaO2 values decreased from 78.9 mmHg before GM-CSF to 72.8 mmHg after 24 h (p < 0.01, maximum shift 15 mmHg). PaO2 shifts occurred mainly with pre-existing lowered paO2, but otherwise were independent of age, the route of GM-CSF administration, leukocyte levels, or increase of leukocytes with GM-CSF. Increases in AaDO2 reflected the paO2 shifts (p < 0.05). No dyspnea corresponded to these changes. DLCO values did not decrease significantly after 24 h. Summarily, contemporary dosage of yeast rhGM-CSF avoids short-term oxygen desaturations, but leads to clinically benign impairment in oxygen tension, based on ventilation/perfusion mismatches. This should be taken into account for patients starting at subnormal paO2.","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this response was modulated by a concomitant increase in serum levels of the potential IL4 antagonist soluble IL4 receptor alpha chain (sIL4R alpha). (ii) Even during leucopenia a subset of T lymphocytes derived from leucopenic patients expressed the activation markers CD25 (IL2 receptor), CD71 (transferrin receptor) and HLA-DR.

As the precise molecular mechanism by which this substance and probably other ether lipids exert their biological effects is still not defined, we tried to approach this problem by generating a cell line resistant to the antiproliferative properties of HePC. This was successfully accomplished by slow adaptation over a period of 14 months, of the very sensitive human leukemia cell line HL60. HePC resistant HL60 cells (HL60R) tolerate 8- to 10-fold higher doses of HePC and are continuously cultured in medium containing 10 micrograms/ml of HePC. An immunophenotypic and karyotypic characterization of HL60 and HL60R cells showed only marginal differences between the two cell lines. Total phospholipids, total cholesterol, protein and vinyl ether lipid content were equal in both cells. A down-regulation of the ether lipid mass in HL60R of about 40% could reflect one mechanism of tolerance induction. Though HePC uptake in HL60R cells was significantly lower than in the parental line, steady state measurements of cellular HePC content revealed similar HePC content in the membranes at HePC concentrations that were cytotoxic for HL60 but did not affect HL60R. This observation indicates that uptake and cellular accumulation of HePC do not determine HePC resistance. The resistant HL60R cells also showed a considerable degree of cross-resistance to ether phospholipids ET-18-OCH3 and BM 41.440, suggesting a common mode of action for HePC and other ether lipid analogues.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Clinic of Gottingen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The drug is metabolized to benzamide adenine dinucleotide (BAD), which in turn functions as a selective inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity with a Ki of 0.118 microM. In vitro, BR is a more potent antitumor inhibitor of IMPDH than tiazofurin, another IMPDH inhibitor which has shown significant oncolytic activity in adult patients with end-stage leukemia. To elucidate the mechanism of resistance, a variant of human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells was developed by subculturing sensitive cells in sublethal concentrations of BR over 60 generations. The BR resistant line that emerged exhibited an IC50 (a concentration producing 50% reduction in cell proliferation) of 148 microM, compared to the sensitive line which had an IC50 of 1.6 microM. The activity of the target enzyme, IMPDH, was increased 3-fold in the resistant variant. Studies on BR metabolism revealed that resistant cells formed only 18% of the active metabolite, BAD, compared to sensitive cells. This finding, in turn, correlated with the specific activity of NAD pyrophosphorylase (the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of BAD) which was reduced to undetectable levels in the resistant variant. The basal levels of NAD and guanylates were also significantly decreased to 41% and 48%, respectively, in the resistant line compared to the parent line. Additionally, after treatment with BR a decrease in guanylate level was observed only in the sensitive cells. Sensitive and resistant cells exhibit comparable cytotoxicity to agents outside the tiazofurin family, suggesting that a multidrug resistance was unlikely to explain the resistance to BR. Moreover, BR resistant cells exhibit collatoral sensitivity to 6-aminopurine, cytarabine and 5-fluorouracil, which have different mechanisms of action. In conclusion, these studies establish that the primary mechanism of resistance to BR involves an increase in IMPDH (target enzyme) activity with a concurrent decrease in NAD pyrophosphorylase (BAD synthetic enzyme) activity.","['Laboratory for Experimental Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5200, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COMPARE analyses relating correlation coefficients of other anticancer drugs with those of fazarabine suggest that this agent operates through a similar mode of action to that of cytarabine. Studies have been carried out both in culture and in vivo to examine the mechanism of action of fazarabine in P388 murine and Molt-4 human lymphoblasts. Authentic fazarabine nucleotide standards were prepared by chemical and enzymatic methods and characterized on HPLC by comparison to related pyrimidine nucleoside-5'-phosphates as well as by enzymatic digestion. Fazarabine inhibited the incorporation of labeled thymidine into DNA without influencing the synthesis of RNA or protein. Deoxycytidine overcomes this inhibition of DNA synthesis and also prevents the cytotoxicity of the drug to lymphoblasts, probably by competing for fazarabine uptake and metabolism. Fazarabine was rapidly phosphorylated in both cell lines; in P388 cells it was incorporated into DNA, where it continued to undergo the same type of ring opening and degradation as the free nucleoside. Alkaline elution studies demonstrated that exposure to the agent resulted in the formation of alkaline labile sites. Fazarabine also inhibited the methylation of deoxycytidine residues in DNA, but this effect was less pronounced than that produced by 5-azacytidine. Taken together, these studies suggest that fazarabine probably acts by arresting the synthesis and/or altering the structural integrity or functional competence of DNA.","['Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",,['CA-51770/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFO/MES were administered as a 24-h i.v. continuous infusion in doses ranging from 5 g/m2 to 9 g/m2; the courses of treatment were repeated every 3 weeks. Patients were examined for toxicity after every cycle and responses were carefully defined and evaluated. All 11 admitted patients were evaluable for toxicity and response. Myelosuppression was the dose limiting effect and it was dose-related. Microscopic and/of macroscopic hematuria was detected in four (11%) out of 36 cycles administered. Ifosfamide produced a positive biological response with a preliminary response rate of 45.4%. Ifosfamide/mesna in a 24-h i.v. continuous infusion appears to be tolerated and produces a biological response in ALL.

A 170 kDa membrane glycoprotein which is related to the overexpression of the mdr1 gene is inserted in the plasma membrane and pumps the cytotoxic drugs out of the cells. The aim of this work was to study the morphological modifications of resistant CEM/VLB 100 cells relative to their parental drug-sensitive ones and the detection of the ultrastructural localization of P-glycoprotein at the cytoplasmic level. Using a scanning electron microscope, CEM resistant cells showed wide smooth protrusions while CEM sensitive cells showed microvilli and fine folds. With transmission electron microscopy, an enhanced secretory system was observed in CEM resistant cells: both electron transparent and electron opaque vesicles were associated with the Golgi system, revealed by wheat germ agglutinin-colloidal gold labelling. These vesicles were the binding site of C 219 and MRK 16 antimembrane glycoprotein antibodies, and some of them were determined to belong to the lysosomal system after PTA staining. These vesicles may be an additional way to decrease the cellular uptake of drugs in multidrug resistant cells. Moreover, some nuclear and nucleolar modifications were also observed. These observations show that MDR has wide morphological features which concern several organelles.","['GIBSA (EA 1238), Reims, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This relative resistance is thought to be due to the t(14;18) that results in the constitutive overexpression of the death-inhibiting protein bcl-2. However, the observation that FL cells are sensitive to treatment in vivo and prone to apoptosis on in vitro culture questions whether bcl-2 alone is responsible for the pathogenesis and clinical behavior of this disease. Therefore, multiple genes are likely to be involved in both the lymphomagenesis and the clinical course of FL. We examined whether expression of other bcl-2 family genes might also be operative. Here, we show that FL cells display a different pattern of expression of bcl-2 family proteins from normal germinal center (GC) B cells that are thought to be their normal counterpart. FL cells express the death-suppressor proteins bcl-2, bcl-xL, and mcl-1; whereas GC B cells express bcl-xL and mcl-1 but also the proapoptotic proteins bax-alpha and bad. Although maintaining constitutive levels of bcl-2 and mcl-1, FL cells are not protected from apoptosis when cultured in vitro. Their propensity to undergo apoptosis is temporally associated with downregulation of bcl-xL. More importantly, activation of FL cells via CD40 not only prevents downregulation but increases the level of bcl-xL expression and results in promotion of survival. These results support the hypothesis that the overexpression of bcl-2 is not the only antiapoptotic mechanism responsible for the pathogenesis of FL. Survival of FL cells is determined by a number of death-inhibiting proteins, among which bcl-xL appears to have the most critical role. Moreover, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that, although FL cells are malignant, they respond to microenvironmental signals such as CD40L that appear to contribute to their survival through the upregulation of death-inhibiting proteins.","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",,"['CA55207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of tumor-derived VH genes of neoplastic B lymphocytes was used to determine the clonal relationship between the IgM expressed or secreted by the tumor cells and the IgG serum paraprotein. In all five cases, VH gene sequences showed transcripts of IgM and IgG of common clonal origin. Sequences were derived from VH3 (4 of 5) and VH1 (1 of 5) families and were all highly somatically mutated with strong evidence for antigen selection. There was no intraclonal variation detectable in either IgM or IgG sequences. In 3 of 5 cases, in which monoclonal IgM and IgG were found in serum, the VH genes combined to Cmu or Cgamma showed identical mutational patterns. However, in 2 of 5 cases, in which IgM was confined to cell expression with only monoclonal IgG in serum, sequences of the VH transcripts of IgM and IgG showed many shared mutations but also numerous differences. In these cases, the level of mutation was similar in IgM and IgG and both appeared to be antigen selected. In summary, the final neoplastic event in this group of tumors has apparently occurred at the point of isotype switch from IgM to IgG, leading to dual isotype synthesis. In the group that secreted both isotypes, the mutation pattern was identical, indicating either synthesis by a single cell, or silencing of mutational activity before switching. In the group that did not secrete IgM, cells of each isotype were distinct and reflected a divergent mutational history.","['Molecular Immunology Group, Tenovus Laboratory, Southampton University Hospitals, Southampton, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that leukemic mice can be cured with CD80 transfected leukemic cells (B7. 1-AML vaccine) administered early in the course of the disease and that the failure B7.1-AML vaccines administered late cannot be attributed to immunosuppression induced by tumor growth. CD8+ T cells, which are necessary for tumor rejection, are activated rather than suppressed during the first half of the leukemic course in nonvaccinated mice. In this report, we question whether CD86 (B7.2) or the cytokines granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-4 (IL-4), or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) can improve the vaccination potential of AML cells. The choice of cytokines was based on their combined and alone as well ability to direct the differentiation of CD34+ cells into potent antigen-presenting dendritic cells in vitro. Our studies show that (1) mice vaccinated with a leukemogenic number of AML cells engineered to express B7.2 (B7.2-AML) or to secrete GM-CSF, IL-4, or TNF-alpha (GM-, IL-4-, TNF-alpha-AML) do not develop leukemia; (2) GM-AML cells are tumorigenic in sublethally irradiated SJL/J mice but not in Swiss nu/nu mice, indicating that killing of tumor cells is not T-cell-dependent; (3) vaccines with irradiated GM-AML, but not B7.2-, IL-4-, or TNF-alpha-AML cells, can elicit leukemia-specific protective and therapeutic immunity; and (4) in head-to-head comparison experiments, vaccination with irradiated GM-AML is more potent than B7.1-AML, curing 80% and providing 20% prolonged survival of the leukemic mice at week 2, as opposed to cures only up to 1 week with B7.1-AML vaccines. These preclinical data emphasize that GM-CSF gene immunotherapy deserves clinical evaluation in AML.","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was undertaken to investigate biologic aspects of natural killer (NK) cell activity, as recognized effector cells of the GVHD and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) response, from cord blood and conventional BM. NK-cell activity levels of freshly isolated cells from cord blood and BM against K562 targets were comparable. Lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells from both hematopoietic cell sources were compared for their ability to kill target cells by necrotic or apoptotic mechanisms using specific target cell lines. Cord blood cells had significantly higher necrosis-mediated cytotoxic activity against Daudi target cells compared with BM-derived cells. Cord blood LAK cells had relatively high levels of apoptotic-mediated cytotoxicity against YAC-1 target cells, whereas BM-derived LAK cells were unable to induce apoptosis in these cells. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) induced significant granzyme B activity in cord cells in contrast to BM cells, in which very little activity was measured. Western blotting confirmed these findings, with IL-2 inducing granzyme B protein expression in cord cells but not detectable levels in BM cells. BM cells had significantly lower cell surface expression of IL-2R and prolonged culture in IL-2 was only partially able to restore their deficient apoptotic cytotoxic activity.

This beta intracytoplasmic truncated chain (betaIT) has a predicted tail of 46 amino acids, instead of 432 for betaC, with 23 amino acids in common with betaC and then a new sequence of 23 amino acids. In primary myeloid cells, betaIT comprised approximately 20% of the total beta chain message, but was increased up to 90% of total in blast cells from a significant proportion of patients with acute leukemia. Specific anti-betaIT antibodies demonstrated its presence in primary myeloid cells and cell lines. Coexpression of betaIT converted low-affinity GMRalpha chains (KD 2.5 nmol/L) to higher-affinity alphabeta complexes (KD 200 pmol/L). These could bind JAK2 that was tyrosine-phosphorylated by stimulation with GM-CSF. betaIT did not support GM-CSF-induced proliferation when cotransfected with GMRalpha into CTLL-2 cells. Therefore, it may interfere with the signal-transducing properties of the betaC chain and play a role in the pathogenesis of leukemia.","['Department of Haematology, University College London Medical School, London, UK.']",,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of ICSBP-deficient mice showed hematologic alterations similar to chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in humans and suggested a novel role for ICSBP in regulating proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Here we show that ICSBP-mRNA expression is impaired in human myeloid leukemias: 27 of 34 CML patients (79%) and 21 of 32 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (66%) showed very low or absent transcript numbers of ICSBP. In contrast, only 2 of 33 normal volunteers (6%) showed low transcription of ICSBP (P < . 0001 both for CML and AML values). The lack of expression was not associated with lack of lymphatic cells, which normally have been shown to express ICSBP at the highest level. More detailed analysis showed an absence of ICSBP-mRNA also in sorted B cells derived from CML patients. To analyze whether ICSBP may be induced in leukemic cells, ex vivo experiments using a known inducer of ICSBP, IFN-gamma, were performed. Ex vivo treatment of primary CML cells using IFN-gamma resulted in induction of ICSBP transcripts. Furthermore, samples of CML patients during IFN-alpha treatment were analyzed. In 11 of 12 CML patients ICSBP-mRNA was inducible upon in vivo treatment with IFN-alpha, but decreased with progression of CML. Stable transfection of K-562 cell line with ICSBP led to no difference in bcr-abl expression in vitro, although two patients showed an inverse correlation between bcr-abl and ICSBP in vivo. These data suggest that lack of ICSBP may have an important role also in human myeloid leukemogenesis.","['Medizinische Klinik I, Universit-atsklinik Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have conducted a systematic study of human hematopoietic progenitor cells after extended transduction with a GALV-pseudotyped retroviral vector. CD34+/CD38lo Cells were transduced for 5 days and reselected according to phenotype after culture and analyzed for cell cycle status, long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) activity, and gene transfer. Reselection of rare, very primitive progenitor cells was successful. Equal to fresh CD34+/CD38lo cells, >90% of reselected CD34+/CD38lo cells were in G0/G1. CD34+/CD38lo reselection enriched for LTC-IC (10-fold), as compared to freshly isolated CD34+/CD38lo cells with excellent specificity (82.7% of total LTC-IC were recovered in the reselected CD34+/CD38lo population) and recovery (62% of initial LTC-IC number in CD34+/CD38lo cells were recovered in the reselected fraction after transduction). Gene transfer into primitive progenitor cells was efficient with 50.5% G418-resistant LTC-IC colonies and more than 40 copies of vector provirus detectable per 100 nuclei of CD34+/CD38lo cells. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic analysis of phenotype, function, and cell cycle demonstrating retroviral gene transfer into rare, very primitive human hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Because the application of gene therapy vectors in vivo induces cytokine production through specific or nonspecific immune responses, we hypothesized that cytokine-mediated signals may alter vector gene expression. Our data indicate that the cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibit transgene expression from certain widely used viral promoters/enhancers (cytomegalovirus, Rous sarcoma virus, simian virus 40, Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat) delivered by adenoviral, retroviral or plasmid vectors in vitro. A constitutive cellular promoter (beta-actin) is less sensitive to these cytokine effects. Inhibition is at the mRNA level and cytokines do not cause vector DNA degradation, inhibit total cellular protein synthesis, or kill infected/transfected cells. Administration of neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibody results in enhanced transgene expression in vivo. Thus, standard gene therapy vectors in current use may be improved by altering cytokine-responsive regulatory elements. Determination of the mechanisms involved in cytokine-regulated vector gene expression may improve the understanding of the cellular disposition of vectors for gene transfer and gene therapy.","['Department of Surgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-0331, USA.']",['Hum Gene Ther. 1997 Nov 20;8(17):2009-10.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed prospectively the results of 106 Doppler ultrasound examinations of the common hepatic artery from 31 bone marrow transplant patients, 16 of whom had normal liver function. The aetiology of the liver dysfunction in the other 15 patients was veno-occlusive disease (n = 7), unknown (n = 3), hepatic graft-versus-host disease (n = 2), hepatitis (n = 2), or cholestasis (n = 1). We assessed the relationships between the hepatic arterial resistance index (HART) and the results of the serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum albumin (ALB) assays and calculated HARI break-point values that might distinguish patients with liver disease from patients with the normal liver function. RESULTS: The significant break point (P < 0.05) of the HARI was 0.55 for SGOT, SGPT and ALK. LDH was associated with a break point of 0.53. Resistance indices for the common hepatic artery below the break-point values predicted liver dysfunction with specificities of 81%, 80%, 92% and 93%, respectively. There was no significant relationship between liver function tests and ALB levels. CONCLUSION: If below 0.55, the hepatic arterial resistance index is a non-invasive indicator of liver dysfunction in children undergoing bone marrow transplantation.","[""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",,"['CA21765-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a 20-fold variation in sensitivity to THYMITAQ was found within the colorectal cell line panel (IC50 0.12-2.7 microM), sensitivity was not related to TS activity, TS protein or TS mRNA levels. For the leukaemic cell lines, only a twofold range in sensitivity to THYMITAQ was observed (IC50 0.87-2.3 microM), and this did not correlate with TS activity, TS protein or TS mRNA levels. Across all of the cell lines, TS activity was linearly related to TS protein levels (r2 = 0.87, P < 0.0001). However, for both the colorectal and leukaemia cell line panels, no relationship was found between TS mRNA/18S rRNA ratios and either TS activity or TS protein, consistent with the importance of post-transcriptional mechanisms in regulating TS activity. Two of the colorectal cell lines (BE and HCT116) and one of the human leukaemic cell lines (HL60), were intrinsically resistant to THYMITAQ (IC50 > 2 microM) in the absence of TS overexpression, suggesting that, subsequent to TS inhibition, events such as DNA repair and tolerance to apoptotic stimuli are also important determinants of sensitivity to THYMITAQ.","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, Sir James Spence Institute of Child Health, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",,,,,PMC2228199,,,,,,,,,,

Data on childhood leukaemia were examined from five previous studies of the author in which significant excesses had been found associated with population-mixing involving adults. Occupational titles were categorized according to the estimated level of work contacts as medium, high, very high or indeterminate. Occupations involving frequent contact with children were categorized as having a very high contact level given the high frequency of exposure to the infection postulated as underlying childhood leukaemia. There was a significant positive trend (P < 0.001) in childhood leukaemia risk at ages 0-14 years across the occupational contact categories from the reference group (comprising the medium and low plus indeterminate categories) through high to very high (i.e. high-child) contact categories in the combined data from the author's five studies of adult population-mixing; this significant trend also applied at ages 0-4 (P < 0.001) and 5-14 (P < 0.01) years. The excess in the high category was mainly because of paternal occupations connected with the construction industry and transport, suggesting a broader definition of the 'very high' contact category. No sign of these excesses was found in a limited examination of the question outside areas of population-mixing using mortality data for childhood leukaemia in the general population of England and Wales. The findings represent the first individual-based support for infection underlying childhood leukaemia that is promoted by population-mixing, as well as further support for the role of adults in transmission of the infection.","['Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Oxford, The Radcliffe Infirmary, UK.']",,,,,PMC2228196,,,,,,,,,,

F'lac and hemolysin plasmids were eliminated by some substituted phenothiazines from E. coli at a very low frequency. The same phenothiazine derivatives also were synergistic with tetracycline in bacteria and shown antimutagenic effect in Ames test. No mutagenic effects were observed in TA 98 strain of Salmonella typhimunium. Chloroethyl-substituted phenothiazines showed antimutagenicity equivalent to the parent compounds; however, phthalimido-substituted phenothiazines had higher antimutagenicity of 50%. P-glycoprotein responsible for multidrug resistance was also inhibited in tumor cells. The accumulation of the fluorescent rhodamine 123 in the phenothiazine treated multi-drug resistant tumor cells was measured by flow cytometry. Some of the substituted phenothiazines were effective P-glycoprotein blockers, while some compounds had moderate activity, but others were without effect as compared to 5 microM verapamil. On the basis of computer analysis there are some correlations between the biological activities and the dipole moments, and entropy of the studied molecules. Our results suggest that the inhibition of Hly+ plasmid replication and P-glycoprotein function may depend partly on similar electronic properties of the studied phenothiazine derivatives.

Alkyl-urea derivatives of phenothiazines displayed in vitro antitumor activity. The phenothiazine phthalimido derivatives (1-6) were not active on the majority of cancer cell cultures. In contrast, propylureas (9, 11) were active against some leukemia cell types. Only two compounds with the butylene [(CH2)4] linker (10, 12) were active against non-small lung cancer cells. Compounds containing the propylene linker were less effective. On colon cancer lines, tumor cells from the central nervous system and on melanoma cells the same compounds were effective, however, having substituents at the 2-position of phenothiazine seems to be important. Surprisingly, the majority of ovarian cancer cell lines (except one type, IGROVI) and five of eight renal cancer lines were not sensitive to these phenothiazine derivatives. The two butylene linked phenothiazine ureas (10, 12) had moderate antiproliferative action on two renal cancer cell lines. The prostate cancer and some breast cancer cell lines were not sensitive. Nevertheless some breast cancer cell lines were apparently sensitive to CF3-substituted phenothiazine alkylureas. On the basis of these experiments one may postulate that in the case of insensitive cells an mdr-gene encoded multidrug resistance efflux pump is responsible for the resistance.

METHODS: PSC 833 was evaluated for cytotoxicity in the MDR P388/ADR and MCF7/ADR cell lines. Cellular uptake levels and intracellular DOX distribution characteristics were assessed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. These parameters were correlated with the chemosensitivity of the MDR cells under varying conditions of exposure to PSC 833 and DOX. RESULTS: PSC 833 (1 microM) provided near complete MDR reversal and exhibited significant latent modulating activity indicative of a sustained inhibition of the PGP pump in P388/ADR and MCF7/ADR cells after removal of the MDR modulator. Interestingly, complete latent chemosensitizing activity could be achieved by pulsing cells with PSC 833 prior to DOX exposure. Increases in cellular DOX uptake by individual P388/ADR and MCF7/ADR cells induced by MDR modulators correlated well with their ability to chemosensitize the resistant tumor cells where intracellular DOX levels approaching those obtained for sensitive wild type cells was observed for PSC 833. CONCLUSION: The MDR modulator PSC 833 exhibits latent MDR modulating activity that appears well suited for modulating PGP mediated MDR in vivo where chemosensitization is complicated by difficulties in synchronizing therapeutic levels of modulator and anticancer drug at the tumor site.","['Division of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both agents reduced L1210 lymphoid leukemia DNA, RNA, and protein syntheses with the largest reductions occurring in DNA synthesis. Reductions in DNA synthesis appear to be mediated by inhibition of key enzyme activities (i.e., DNA polymerase a, IMP dehydrogenase, and PRPP amido transferase). These agents had little effect on in vitro L1210 DNA topoisomerase II activity at 100 microM but were able to cause synergistic increases in protein-linked DNA breaks when combined with etoposide (VP16). It was shown that these agents significantly reduced protein kinase C mediated phosphorylation of human topoisomerase II in vitro. Thus, inhibition of topoisomerase II phosphorylation may be a mechanism by which these agents and VP-16 are synergistic in causing protein-linked DNA breaks.","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products, School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7360, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were discovered in the context of leukemic transformation and as an autoantigen in primary biliary cirrhosis, respectively. Both proteins are expressed in the form of many COOH-terminally spliced variants, and their expression is enhanced by interferons (IFN). The recent finding that PIC1/SUMO-1, a small ubiquitin-like protein, is covalently linked to the RanGAP1 protein of the nuclear pore complex and also binds PML in yeast cells led us to determine whether PML is covalently modified by PIC1/SUMO-1 and whether the same is true for Sp100. We found an immune reaction of PML and Sp100 proteins with a PIC1/SUMO-1-specific monoclonal antibody by immunoblotting when using cell extracts prepared from stably transfected cells inducibly expressing one isoform of each protein as well as from nontransfected cells. In contrast, both proteins did not react when synthesized in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining showed that PIC1/SUMO-1 colocalized with Sp100 and PML in NDs except in mitotic cells, in which PML and Sp100 are dissociated. Cell fractionation and immunoblotting demonstrated that PIC1/SUMO-1 immunoreactive Sp100 in IFN-treated and untreated cells was exclusively nuclear, whereas nonmodified Sp100 was also found in the cytoplasm.

Because the natural history of CML varies and quality of life with CML may be excellent until shortly before death, deciding whether and when to pursue unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation is often difficult. OBJECTIVE: To compare early transplantation, delayed transplantation, and no transplantation for patients with chronic-phase CML on the basis of discounted, quality-adjusted life expectancy. DESIGN: A markov model comparing different strategies was constructed. This model considers patient age, quality of life, risk aversion, and the competing risks for CML progression and transplant toxicity. SETTING: Therapeutic decision at the time of diagnosis of CML. PATIENTS: The base case is a 35-year-old patient with intermediate-prognosis CML. Younger and older patients with better and worse prognoses are also evaluated. INTERVENTION: Early transplantation, delayed transplantation, and no transplantation. MEASUREMENTS: Quality-adjusted, discounted life expectancy. RESULTS: For patients with newly diagnosed CML, transplantation within the first year provides the greatest quality-adjusted expected survival, although this benefit decreases with increasing patient age. For a 35-year-old patient with intermediate-prognosis CML, transplantation within the first year results in 53 more discounted, quality-adjusted years of life expectancy than does no transplantation. This finding is robust even with varying baseline assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the use of early unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation for most patients with CML.","['Center for Outcomes and Policy Research, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",,"['CP-21161/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laparoscopic splenectomy causes a lower morbidity comparing to open conventional splenectomy. Frequent indications for elective splenectomy are immune thrombocytopenic purpura, spherocytosis, Non Hodgkin Lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease. Limiting factors to laparoscopic splenectomy may be the size of spleen, concomiting diseases as portal hypertension and adhesions in upper left abdomen. To remove a big sized spleen we placed it within a large specimen retrival bag, which was partly delivered through a port in the left flank to allow digital morcellation of the spleen and piecemal removal. Eight females and fifteen males with a median age of 45 years (16-73) underwent splenectomy of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (14), spherocytosis (2), Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (5), Hodgkin's disease (1) and hair cell leukemia (1) with a spleen weight of 985 grams. The median operating time was 94 min (40-165) and median blood loss was 214 ml (50-400). Accessory spleens were removed in two cases. The median postoperative hospital stay was 5.6 days (3-10). The only complication was a parechymatous bleeding which needed conversion to open splenectomy. With careful selection of patients, laparoscopic splenectomy can be safely performed on normal and even enlarged spleens. The lateral approach is safe and offers excellent visualization of the splenic vessels, pancreas, and accessory spleens.","['Klinik fur Chirurgie, Kantonsspital, St. Gallen.']",,,,,,"Indikationen, Technik und Ergebnisse der laparoskopischen Splenektomie.",,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the prevalence of infection caused by Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) in the CLMS. We investigated the presence of anti-BLV antibodies in 4,203 milk samples taken from 73 dairy farms belonging to the CLMS. An indirect ELISA, which is described and evaluated in this paper, was used to test the antibodies in milk. We classified the dairy farms according to their rate of infection. The percentage of dairy farms free of infection resulted in 31.50. On the other hand, 49.40% of the dairy farms showed a figure between 1% and 15% of infected cattle; 17.80% between 16% and 30%, and the remaining 1.30% turned out more than 30% of infected cattle. If compared with data obtained in the 1979-1981 period, which showed that 95.65% of the dairy farms was BLV-free, it is clear that a dramatic progress of the BLV infection has occurred for the last 15 years. Nevertheless, the CLMS is in a privileged position so as to incorporate an inexpensive control plan to eradicate the BLV infection, as almost 1/3 of its dairy farms is still BLV-free and 49.40% still has a low rate of BLV infection. Only about 20% of the dairy farms would require costly strategies of control.","['Departamento de Sanidad Animal y Medicina Preventiva, Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias, Universidad Nacional del Centro, Tandil, Argentina.']",,,,,,Virus de la leucosis bovina (BLV): prevalencia en la Cuenca Lechera Mar y Sierras entre 1994 y 1995.,,,,,,,,,

In primary disorders of bone marrow or immune system, allogeneic stem cells replace deficient cells. Acute leukemias can be cured, with in 50 to 80% disease free survival after 5 to 8 years. The allogeneic graft versus leukemia effect by immunoreactive cells reduces the relapse rate in myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. 40 to 70% of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia remain disease free after more than 5 years. Patients with malignant lymphoma have a 40 to 70% chance of cure with autologous transplantation, which is not increased by allogeneic cells, because of a higher incidence of severe complications. An increasing number of patients without option for cure is treated with the aim of prolonging remission or retarding disease progression, such as in chronic myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma and certain solid tumors. New studies suggest in breast cancer with axillary lymph node metastases, that adjuvant high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support will significantly improve disease free survival from 30 to over 60% after 3 to 5 years.

The mechanisms underlying this control are still unknown. However, recent studies suggest that some locally produced cytokines may be involved in the regulation of spermatogonial activity. In this context, Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) exhibits interesting properties regarding stem cells and, particularly, primordial germ cells. The present study aimed at investigating LIF production and LIF binding abilities by/of the different testicular cells types (somatic and germ cells). Our study demonstrates that LIF is produced within the testis, mainly by peritubular cells which are in the vicinity of spermatogonia, the latter cells expressing high levels of LIF receptors. These results strongly suggest an involvement of LIF in the control of spermatogonial activity.","[""Groupe d'etude de la Reproduction chez le Male, INSERM U 435, Universite de Rennes I.""]",,,,,,Controle paracrine des cellules souches de la spermatogenese: l'exemple du leukemia inhibitory factor.,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the nutritional support (NS) protocol for patients subjected to a BMT in our center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 55 patients were included (24 men and 31 women), who were subjected to BMT during 1994, with prior chemotherapy depending on the underlying disease. The nutritional condition (NC) was evaluated upon initiation and at the end of the NS, using anthropometric, biochemical, and immunological parameters. The NS was given by total parenteral nutrition (TPN), adapted to the needs, as of the second post-transplant day, until such time that oral nutrition was sufficient to supply the nutritional needs of the patients; oral ingestion was permitted at all times, according to the possibilities of the patient. For the statistical analysis, we used the Student's t test, Pearson's Chi squared test, and Spearman's test, with differences being considered significant for values < 0.05. RESULTS: The average duration of the TPN was 16 +/- 6 days, with a significantly longer time (p < 0.05) in patients with leukemia. The NC assessment was no different at the beginning and at the end of the NS, although all groups show a drop in the albumin levels at the end with respect to those at the beginning, with this being statistically significant in patients with leukemia (p < 0.05), and with solid tumors (p < 0.01), 14.5% of the patients maintained an acceptable oral ingestion (with 75% having lymphomas), and 34.5% did not show any associated oral ingestion. Te better albumin maintenance was correlated with acceptable oral ingestion (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional support of patients subjected to a BMT is effective for maintaining their NC levels. The longest duration of the TPN, the lowest frequency of associated oral ingestion, and the greatest decrease of the serum albumin, levels are seen in those cases which had the most aggressive chemotherapy prior to the BMT, which requires adaptation of the NS in function of the underlying disease. The association of oral ingestion may be beneficial due to its effect on the gastrointestinal tract.","['Unidad de Nutricion Clinica y Dietetica, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Espana.']",,,,,,Soporte nutricional en trasplante de medula osea.,,,,,,,,,

We show here that treatment of Jurkat cells with either anti-Fas antibodies, anthracyclin drugs or actinomycin D induces the activation of CPP32 (caspase-3) and apoptosis. However, DOX treatment did not induce the expression of membrane FasL or the release of soluble FasL and co-incubation with blocking anti-Fas antibodies prevented Fas-induced but not DOX-induced apoptosis. All the morphological and biochemical signs of apoptosis induced by anti-Fas or DOX can be prevented by Z-VAD-fmk, a general caspase inhibitor. DEVD-cho, a specific inhibitor of CPP32-like caspases which completely blocks Fas-mediated apoptosis, prevented drug-induced nuclear apoptosis but not cell death.

To examine the roles of activin-A, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, and follistatin, the binding protein for activin-A, in M phi function, we investigated their effects on foam cell formation of THP-1 M phi s. When THP-1 M phi s were treated with activin-A (5 nmol/L), foam cell formation and cellular cholesteryl ester accumulation were decreased. This downregulation was paralleled by a reduction in cell association and degradation of acetylated LDL. The inhibitory effect of activin-A on cell association and degradation was dose dependent, and the effect was blocked by concomitant addition of follistatin. Activin-A (5 nmol/L) also decreased the Bmax for acetylated LDL and scavenger receptor mRNA expression. Follistatin showed an effect opposite to that of activin-A and promoted M phi foam cell formation and cellular cholesteryl ester accumulation. It increased binding, cell association, and degradation of acetylated LDL and upregulated scavenger receptor mRNA expression. Because follistatin is the binding protein for activin-A, follistatin's effect is considered to be mediated by blocking the inhibitory effect of intrinsic activin-A. These results indicate that activin-A inhibits and follistatin promotes M phi foam cell formation by regulating scavenger receptor mRNA expression. We conclude that activin-A and follistatin play important roles in the process of atherosclerosis by regulating M phi foam cell formation.","['Department of Geriatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ocular manifestations of polycythemia vera include occipital cortex transient ischemic attacks, transient monocular blindness, vaso-occlusive disease, and retinal hemorrhages. CASE REPORT: A 56-year old man with longstanding polycythemia vera sought treatment for a chief symptom of blurred vision in the left eye and a red tinge to things first noticed on awakening that morning. He had preretinal and intraretinal hemorrhages and was subsequently found to be severely anemic as a result of postpolycythemic myeloid metaplasia after years of phlebotomy. Splenectomy controlled his anemia and thrombocytopenia, allowing transient improvement of the retinal hemorrhages. Acute leukemia subsequently developed and the patient died 7 weeks after initial examination. CONCLUSION: In this case, preretinal and intraretinal hemorrhages were found in a patient with longstanding polycythemia vera. The exact origin of these hemorrhages is uncertain. They are probably secondary to anemia, but the possibility that they are sites of extramedullary hematopoiesis must be considered. The appearance of retinal hemorrhages warrants careful investigation to rule out diabetes, hypertension, and anemia, as well as the various other blood dyscrasias.","['School of Optometry, University of Alabama at Birmingham, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The possible roles of these mechanisms in clinical drug resistance and clinical outcomes for patients with hematologic malignancies are now under investigation. Available data indicate that the blast content of topo II does not correlate with clinical outcome in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and this may also be true in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are resistant to topo II inhibitors because they express low levels of topo II.

The emergence of these mechanisms of MDR in multiple myeloma is enhanced by exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. Recently, clinical reversal of MDR by noncytotoxic P-gp modulators such as verapamil, cyclosporin A (CsA), and PSC 833 was explored in acute leukemia and multiple myeloma.

The majority of AML patients are intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy at initial diagnosis before chemotherapeutic exposure; such intrinsic resistance frequently results from expression of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR-1), which encodes a membrane transporter protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), that mediates drug efflux in leukemic cells. Expression of novel transporter proteins that confer alternative forms of multidrug resistance (MDR), such as the lung-resistance protein (LRP) and the MDR-associated protein (MRP), occurs more frequently in leukemic patients at relapse. Preliminary studies indicate that these proteins may also confer therapeutic resistance in leukemia. In patients older than 55 years of age, AML is characterized by a high frequency of unfavorable cytogenetics, P-gp expression, and functional drug efflux, which contribute to poor clinical outcome. In a multivariate analysis, secondary AML, unfavorable cytogenetics, and P-gp expression/function were each significantly and independently associated with a lower complete remission (CR) rate. Resistant disease was associated with P-gp expression and unfavorable cytogenetics. Strikingly, elderly patients with P-gp- de novo AML and favorable or intermediate cytogenetics had a CR rate of 81%. Patients with P-gp+ secondary AML with unfavorable cytogenetics had a CR rate of only 12%. Therefore, characterization of elderly AML patients at diagnosis using biologic parameters may help identify those patients who are likely to achieve a CR with conventional regimens, as well as those patients who require alternate treatment designed to overcome MDR. In contrast, expression of P-gp and functional drug efflux is detected in only 25% to 30% of AML patients less than 50 years of age. While P-gp expression is less strongly associated with a poor outcome in younger versus older AML patients, it remains strongly associated with resistant disease. Studies are ongoing to determine the prognostic significance of LRP and MRP in various forms of leukemia.","['UNM Center for Molecular and Cellular Diagnostics, University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque 87131, USA. cwillman@cobra.unm.edu']",,"['CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A minority of cases are early pre-B (clg-/slg-), do not express the characteristic pattern of cell surface antigens, and lack E2A-PBX1 fusion mRNAs. These latter cases are frequently hyperdiploid, with a modal chromosome number of 55-57.

Mortality analyses based on standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) showed overall mortality was significantly lower than expected compared with the U.S. general population (SMR = 82, 95% CI = 79-86). Total cancer mortality was also lower than expected (SMR = 92, 95% CI = 84-100). Significant mortality deficits from several malignant and nonmalignant diseases were reported. A significant mortality increase in the broad category of lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers was found (SMR = 133, 95% CI = 103-170). This increase was attributed to a nonsignificant elevation in leukemia of all cell types combined (SMR = 139, 95% CI = 92-201) and a borderline significant increase in other lymphatic tissue cancer (SMR = 158, 95% CI = 101-235). The elevation in leukemia was confined to workers hired before 1950. Furthermore, the leukemia excess was shown to have peaked during the 1960s, with mortality no longer elevated post-1980. Analyses of cell type-specific leukemias showed a similar temporal pattern for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) which was not significantly elevated (SMR = 136, 95% CI = 59-268). Mortality from other leukemia cell types was similar to or lower than expected. Mortality from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (SMR = 140, 95% CI = 88-211) and multiple myeloma (MM) (SMR = 121, 95% CI = 55-230) were increased, but neither was statistically significant nor likely to be related to refinery employment. No death from asbestosis was reported, and mortality from mesothelioma and pulmonary fibrosis was lower than expected. Lung cancer mortality for the overall cohort was similar to expected. For the overall cohort, analyses by duration of employment and time since first employment showed no evidence of any trends for increasing cause-specific mortality. Separate analyses of male workers employed in operator jobs showed mortality patterns that were more favorable than those of the total cohort. Maintenance craftworkers showed statistically significant elevations in mortality for prostate cancer (SMR = 145, 95% CI = 107-194), leukemia (SMR = 179, 95% CI = 111-273), and other lymphatic tissue cancer (SMR = 233, 95% CI = 138-368). Detailed analyses indicated that, among maintenance craftworkers, mortality was elevated for AML, NHL, and MM, but none was significant. Furthermore, no upward trend by duration of maintenance jobs was observed. A small increase of lung cancer was observed among maintenance craftworkers (SMR = 120, 95% CI = 99-145), which was borderline significant. No relationship between lung cancer and duration of maintenance employment was found. In contrast, a deficit of pulmonary fibrosis was reported among maintenance craftworkers (SMR = 62, 95% CI = 17-159). These findings are discussed in conjunction with results from other refinery studies, and the limitations of the study are discussed.","['Mobil Business Resources Corporation, Global Medical Services, New Hope, Pennsylvania 18938, USA. gerhard_k_raabe@email.mobil.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results revealed differing overall patterns. For men the highest frequencies were found for lymphoma, bladder cancer and cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx in Egypt, and for lung cancer, leukaemia and lymphoma in Gaza. For women, breast cancer had the highest frequency in both areas, followed by cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx in Egypt, and leukaemia and lymphoma in Gaza. The distribution of cancer occurrence by organ system also varied. In the light of the different ethnicities, lifestyles, socioeconomic levels and carcinogenic exposure among the countries of the Middle East, this kind of comparison can provide the background for more sophisticated approaches for discerning risk factors in cancer. We believe that further cooperation among participating countries will overcome the present limitations in data collection, registration and access.","['Institute of Occupational Health, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major indications are hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplastic syndromes. Unrelated donors are increasingly used and there are around 4 million volunteer donors available in different registers, the largest being the National Marrow Donor Program. Molecular typing has improved the typing technique which has resulted in a decreased risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), lower transplant-related mortality (TRM) and improved leukemia-free survival (LFS). Using HLA-identical siblings, patients with AML in first complete remission (1 CR) and high-risk ALL in 1 CR are clear indications for BMT. However, if an HLA-identical sibling is not available, it is not known today if an unrelated bone marrow or autografting is the best option for all patients with acute leukemia in 1 CR. Because BMT is the only curable treatment for CML, a search for an unrelated donor should start as soon as it is evident that an HLA-identical sibling is not available. BMT within a year from diagnosis is of major importance for outcome. Allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) have been used as an alternative to bone marrow. Preliminary studies indicate a faster engraftment, but prospective randomized trials are necessary to establish the role of allogeneic PBPC. Umbilical cord blood has also been used as a source of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. Using cord blood from HLA-identical siblings, engraftment seems to be delayed, but the probability of GVHD is low. Preliminary data using unrelated cord blood cells are encouraging. GVHD has an important antileukemic effect. Recently, a graft-versus-myeloma and a graft-versus-breast-cancer effect has been demonstrated. In patients who relapse after BMT, donor lymphocytes can induce remission, especially in patients with CML. With molecular techniques it is possible to detect relapse at an early stage, so called minimal residual disease. Liposomal amphotericin B has few side-effects and decreased the death rate by invasive fungal infection in BMT recipients. Early diagnosis and treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with new antiviral drugs have dramatically reduced the incidence and mortality in CMV disease. Cyclosporine combined with methotrexate is today the most widely used immunosuppressive regimen and has decreased GVHD and improved survival. However, several new immunosuppressive drugs need to be explored in clinical BMT. Immune modulation by for instance cytokines and cytokine inhibititors is a new exciting development.","['Department of Clinical Immunology, Huddinge Hospital, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.

The association with the human T-cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus type I is one of the distinctive etiopathogenetic features of this disease. However, unlike other acute transforming retroviruses, the human T-cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus type I lacks an oncogene within its genome. Other human postthymic leukemias, such as T-prolymphocytic leukemias, involve mostly the CD4 cellular subset and share many similarities to ATLs (aggressive course, cutaneous involvement, CD4+, CD29+, CD45RA- phenotype, and alpha-naphthyl-acetate esterase positivity). A chromosomal rearrangement at 14q32.1, involved in translocations or inversions with either the alpha/delta locus [t(14;14)(q11;q32.1), inv14(q11;q32.1)], or the beta-chain locus of the T-cell receptor [t(7;14)(q35;q32.1)] is found. These rearrangements disregulate a gene, TCL1, located at the 14q32.1 region, that we show is physiologically expressed in CD4/CD8 double-negative thymocyte cells, but not in more differentiated CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations. Here, using molecular and immunocytochemical analysis, we report that TCL1 is also overexpressed in 10 of 10 ATL specimens, indicating that this gene may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease.","['Laboratory of Vascular Pathology, Roma, Italy.']",,['CA 39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary AML cells were retrovirally transduced with the murine costimulatory molecule B7.1, a natural ligand for the T-cell receptors CD28 and CTLA-4, or the cytokine GM-CSF. Mice were vaccinated with irradiated AML cells expressing B7.1 or GM-CSF before or after inoculation of wild type AML cells. RESULTS: Intravenous injection of irradiated B7.1 or GM-CSF expressing AML cells can provide long lasting systemic immunity against a subsequent challenge of wild type AML cells. Vaccination with irradiated B7.1 or GM-CSF expressing AML cells results in rejection of established leukemia when the vaccination occurs in the early stages of the disease. However, when the vaccines are administered > 2 weeks after leukemic inoculation, only mice which receive the GM-CSF vaccine are cured of leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that tumor burden and vaccine efficiency are most likely to be the limiting factors in the curative potential of tumor vaccines. Novel approaches such as this experiment could provide improved therapeutic outcomes in patients with AML and other cancers.","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",,,27,,,,,,,,,,,,

SLVL usually runs a benign clinical course but symptoms related a benign clinical course but symptoms related to splenomegaly or hypersplenism may be a problem.

Together with its ligand, the stem cell factor (SCF), it plays an important role in hematopoiesis. In this study, we review the cellular distribution of CD117 in normal hematopoiesis and in hematopoietic malignancies focusing on the differential expression in subtypes of acute leukemias. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: This review is based on a literature search in the Medline database, personal publications and results obtained as a reference laboratory of the German AML-BFM, AMLCG and ALL multi-center therapy studies. STATE OF THE ART AND PERSPECTIVES: Membrane expression of CD117 can be found on leukemic blasts from approximately 60% of adult and childhood AML patients, often associated with an immature immunophenotype (CD34). Moreover, AML with t(8;21) are frequently CD117 positive. Despite earlier reports, most recent studies have not been able to demonstrate any significant prognostic impact of CD117 expression in either childhood or adult AML. A small proportion of T-lineage ALL (9%), mainly consisting of immature pro-T/pre-T-ALL, is CD117 positive. CD117 expression is rare in B-cell-precursor-ALL and occurs in less than 3% of cases. CD117 in combination with other antigens might facilitate the immunologic characterization of acute leukemias, especially those of myeloid and early T-cell origin.","['Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Robert-Rossle-Klinik, Humboldt-Universitat, Berlin, Germany.']",,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because there are no definitive data as to the most appropriate therapeutic approach to CNS leukemia in AML, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of AML patients with meningeal leukemia in order to increase our knowledge on this particular matter. METHODS: Out of 410 patients with de novo AML observed at our Institute from 1986 to 1995, 9 (2.2%) showed CNS leukemia (CNSL) during the follow-up. CNSL was treated as follows: in a first group of 4 patients we combined systemic HD Ara-C 3 g/m2 (every 12 hours by 3-hour infusion, for 6 doses), cranial radiation therapy and intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX); a second group of 4 patients was treated with HD Ara-C, IT MTX without cranial irradiation; HD Ara-C alone was administered in one patient. RESULTS: All patients of the first group and 2 patients of the second who achieved a complete remission (CR) had a median survival of 10 months (range 5-25+) after CNS involvement, while for the non-remitters it was 2 months (range 1-5). The only patient still living underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The combination treatment of HD Ara-C, IT MTX and cranial irradiation is well tolerated and seems to be an effective therapy for CNSL, presenting a high incidence of neurologic CR that correlates with a longer survival. As expected, the number of AML patients with CNSL was small, due to the fact that CNS in those patients is a rare complication. However, this study provides further information about the therapeutic possibilities in such restricted subsets of AML patients.","['Divisione di Ematologia, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo di Pavia, Universita degli Studi di Pavia, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored the in vitro Mitox- fludarabine (FAMP)- and pentostatin (Pento)-induced cytotoxicity and their interactions in CLL. METHODS: The peripheral lymphocytes of 24 CLL patients were tested at different drug concentrations, with Mitox, FAMP or their combinations in 22 cases, and with Mitox, Pento or their combinations in 20 cases, 18 of which were the same from the FAMP group. The MTT assay was chosen for the drug-induced cell cytotoxicity and flow cytometry analysis of the DNA hypodiploid peak for the study of the apoptotic process. Drug interactions were calculated in the MTT assay according to both multiplicative and maximum models. RESULTS: According to the lethal dose (LD) 50 values, when the three drugs were tested alone, 11 out of 22 and 8 out of 20 samples were sensitive to Mitox in the FAMP and Pento groups, respectively; on the other hand, 2 out of 22 and 0 out of 20 samples appeared sensitive to FAMP or Pento alone, respectively. Analyzing the MTT assay data with the multiplicative and maximum model, the combinations of Mitox+FAMP and Mitox+Pento at different drug concentrations were synergistic in 28.2% and 39.3%, respectively. At leukemic cell survival < or = 50%, 11.7% and 11.1% of all combinations were synergistic in the Pento and FAMP group, respectively. The number of synergistic interactions at a therapeutically achievable plasma-drug concentration was an inverse function of the Mitox concentration. In the FAMP group, a direct correlation was found between the LD50 values of both FAMP and Mitox and the number of synergistic interactions, while the Pearson correlation coefficient was not significant in the Pento group. Finally, as measured by the DNA hypodiploid peak, Mitox (0.25 microgram/mL) plus Pento (0.16 microgram/mL) showed a significantly enhanced apoptosis in comparison to each single drug, while Mitox failed to demonstrate an additive effect with FAMP (1 microgram/ml). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This experience demonstrates the extent of the in vitro synergism of Mitox with FAMP and Pento in inducing cell cytotoxicity; it also shows an adjunctive apoptotic effect for the Mitox-Pento association only.","['Centro Trapianti di Midollo Osseo e Terapia Sovramassimale Emato-Oncologica A.

However, it is not clear whether bcl-2 overexpression is a peculiar feature of CD5+ B-CLL. Based on this background we carried out a quantitative flow cytometric evaluation of intracellular bcl-2 levels on leukemic cells of CD5+ and CD5- B-CLL. METHODS: We assessed in flow cytometry levels of bcl-2 protein using a quantitative indirect immunofluorescence assay (QIFI kit) on samples from 46 previously untreated CD5+ B-CLL patients. Results were compared with those obtained on either normal peripheral blood B-lymphocytes or leukemic cells from 7 CD5- B-CLL patients intentionally selected for statistical comparison. RESULTS: A relatively homogeneous amount of bcl-2 protein which did not reflect either clinical-biological features at the time of diagnosis nor in vivo response to therapy was found. Results expressed as antibody binding capacity (ABC) accounted for a mean value of 12.2 +/- 1.5 x 10(3) molecules/cell (range, 6.4-13 x 10(3) molecules/cell). Levels of bcl-2 detected on CD5+ B-CLL leukemic cells were significantly lower than those of B peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors (p = 0.0001). The same applied when comparing CD5+ and CD5- B-CLL patients (bcl-2 ABC, 8.07 +/- 0.26 x 10(3) molecules/cell vs. 12.2 +/- 1.5 x 10(9) molecules/cell; p = 0.0001). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: According to the role of bcl-2 in preventing apoptosis, our results indicate that differences in the pattern of expression of such an oncoprotein, might, at least in part, explain the more aggressive clinical course of CD5- B-CLL forms.","['Divisione Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera, Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormalities of the p53 gene are the most common molecular lesions in human cancer, and may be of prognostic significance in hematologic malignancies. In this study, we examined the p53 gene status in a group of patients with ALL/BL to determine whether some types of mutants were more frequent in this selected group of patients. METHODS: We selected a group of 16 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) in order to investigate the presence of p53 mutations. DNA obtained from affected organs (bone marrow, lymph node and a renal mass) was used for the molecular studies. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of exons 5 to 9 of the gene was used to detect p53 mutants. After detecting an abnormal migration pattern on the SSCP, mutations were determined by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Point mutations were found in eight patients; a misense mutation in seven cases and a non-sense mutation in one case. The normal allele was also identified in 7 mutated samples. The same mutation at codon 282 was identified in three different patients, in whom an identical conformer was detected after SSCP analysis. Mutation at codon 282 was present in an extramedular relapse (renal) appearing after a BMT. No such alteration was present in the bone marrow analyzed at the same time. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that p53 mutations are quite frequent in recognized clinical groups.

When collected in CPD with half of the normal concentration of citrate and citric acid (0.5CPD) and stored in a new additive solution (Erythro-Sol), 2,3-DPG is better maintained. No studies of the oxygen affinity of red cells stored under these conditions have been published. In Erythro-Sol, red cells have a satisfactory in vivo recovery for 49 days but the conditions after 28 days, within which time most red cell units are transfused, have not been investigated. Of importance is also to be able to make platelet concentrates (PCs) from 0.5CPD blood. Little data are available concerning the clinical usefulness of platelets prepared from 0.5CPD buffy coats (BCs). METHODS: Blood was collected in 0.5CPD, held at 20 degrees C for 3-4 h, then separated with the bottom-and-top technique into red cells, plasma and BC. In a storage experiment with 6 U the 2,3-DPG and P50 values were determined weekly and a number of in vitro parameters were tested on day 28. In 6 donors the in vivo recovery and survival of red cells were determined using a single-chromium technique. Transfusions of 212 0.5CPD-Erythro-Sol red cell units were given to hematological patients under supervision. PCs derived from pools of 0.5CPD BCs suspended in PAS2 (T-Sol) were transfused to 20 thrombocytopenic patients and compared with CPD-BC-PCs suspended in PASI. Corrected count increments (CCI) were determined. RESULTS: The erythrocyte 2,3-DPG and P50 values were normal or slightly subnormal initially but increased to supernormal levels during the 1 week, and remained at these levels for a further 1-3 weeks; the 2,3-DPG was two thirds of normal after 28 days, the P50 was 3.72 +/- 0.28 kPa after 14 days and 2.84 +/- 0.41 after 28 days (mean +/- SD). The P50 values corresponded closely (r2 = 0.903) to 2,3-DPG. The in vivo recovery of 4-week-stored red cells was 89.6 +/- 5.5% and the T50 was 32.2 +/- 2.0 days. No adverse effects were observed in the transfusions. The CCI values did not differ between test and control groups; in both, 3- to 5-day-stored PCs gave lower CCI than fresh (0-2 days) PCs. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia AML (n = 11) had significantly lower CCI values than patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloma and lymphoma (n = 9; CCI 1 h: p = 0.001; CCI 24 h: p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Red cells stored in Erythro-Sol sustain a normal or slightly lowered oxygen affinity for 2-4 weeks, their viability is excellent, and they are well tolerated in clinical transfusions. Platelets prepared from 0.5CPD-BCs cause CCI, of the same magnitude as CPD-BCs.","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When KpnI alone was used in the procedure a nuclear LINE family whose elements had mitochondrial-DNA-like insertions was selected. Such elements were much more abundant in tumor than in normal tissue. The results with PstI alone and BamHI alone and each combined with KpnI indicated that there were mobile LINE elements with mitochondrial-DNA-like inserts in the nuclear genome of tumor. The mouse tissues were normal liver and a transplantable lymphoid leukemic ascites cell line L1210 that had been carried for 40 years. The rat tissues were normal liver and a hepatoma freshly induced by diethylnitrosoamine in order to minimize the role of 40 years of transplantation. Our unitary hypothesis for carcinogenesis of 1971, which suggested these experiments, has been augmented to include mobile nuclear elements with inserts of mitochondrial-DNA-like sequences.

However, neither molecular isotypes of receptors nor mechanisms involved in these somatostatin actions have been elucidated as yet. Here we show by using RT-PCR approach that mitogen-activated leukemia T cells (Jurkat) express mRNA for a single somatostatin receptor, sst3. This mRNA is apparently translated into protein since specific somatostatin binding sites (K11 = 78 +/- 3 pM) were detected in semipurified plasma membrane preparations by using 125I-Tyr1-SRIF14 as a radioligand. Moreover, somatostatin inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity with similar efficiency (IC50 = 23 +/- 4 pM) thus strongly suggesting a functional coupling of sst3 receptor to this transduction pathway. The involvement of sst3 receptor in immuno-modulatory actions of somatostatin was assessed by analysis of neuropeptide effects on IL-2 secretion and on proliferation of mitogen-activated Jurkat cells. Our data show that in the concentrations comprised between 10 pM and 10 nM, somatostatin potentiates IL-2 secretion. This effect is correlated with somatostatin-dependent increase of Jurkat cell proliferation since the EC50 concentrations for both actions were almost identical (EC50 = 22 +/- 9 pM and EC50 = 12 +/- 1 pM for IL-2 secretion and proliferation, respectively). Altogether, these data strongly suggest that in mitogen-activated Jurkat cells, somatostatin increases cell proliferation through the increase of IL-2 secretion via a functional sst3 receptor negatively coupled to the adenylyl cyclase pathway.","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Lyon, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some observations suggest that lower platelet counts can be appropriate in patients in stable condition, but the safety of lower thresholds is uncertain. METHODS: We evaluated 255 adolescents and adults (age, 16 to 70 years) with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (but not acute promyelocytic leukemia), who were treated in 21 centers. One hundred thirty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive a transfusion when their platelet count fell below 10,000 per cubic millimeter (or 10,000 to 20,000 per cubic millimeter in those with a temperature above 38 degrees C, with active bleeding, or a need for invasive procedures), and 120 patients were assigned to receive a transfusion when their platelet count was less than 20,000 per cubic millimeter. RESULTS: Patients in the group with a threshold of 10,000 platelets per cubic millimeter received 21.5 percent fewer platelet transfusions than the patients in the group with a threshold of 20,000 platelets per cubic millimeter (P=0.001). The numbers of red-cell units transfused were not significantly different between groups. Major bleeding (defined as any bleeding more than petechiae or mucosal or retinal bleeding) occurred in 21.5 and 20 percent of patients, respectively (P=0.41), and on 3.1 and 2.0 percent of the days of hospitalization. One episode of fatal cerebral hemorrhage occurred in the group with a threshold of 10,000 platelets per cubic millimeter; none occurred in the other group (P= 0.95). Actuarial estimates of survival during induction chemotherapy, actuarial estimates of the absence of major bleeding, and the length of hospital stay were not significantly different in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of major bleeding during induction chemotherapy in adolescents and adults with acute myeloid leukemia (except acute promyelocytic leukemia, which we did not study) was similar with platelet-transfusion thresholds of 20,000 per cubic millimeter and 10,000 per cubic millimeter (or 10,000 to 20,000 per cubic millimeter when body temperature exceeded 38 degrees C, there was active bleeding, or invasive procedures were needed).

Various intracellular signaling intermediates become activated and/or associate by/with Bcr-Abl, including the Src family kinase Hck. To elucidate some of the structural requirements and functional consequences of the association of Bcr-Abl with Hck, their interaction was investigated in transiently transfected COS7 cells. Neither the complex formation of Hck kinase with Bcr-Abl nor the activation of Hck by Bcr-Abl was dependent on the Abl kinase activity. Both inactivating point mutations of Hck and dephosphorylation of Hck enhanced its complex formation with Bcr-Abl, indicating that their physical interaction was negatively regulated by Hck (auto)phosphorylation. Finally, experiments with a series of kinase negative Bcr-Abl mutants showed that Hck phosphorylated Bcr-Abl and induced the binding of Grb2 to Tyr177 of Bcr-Abl.

Continuously proliferating cells evolved from cultures supplemented with nutrient medium containing human serum and granulocyte-macrophage (GM) colony-stimulating factor (CSF). Growth and viability of the HU-3 cell line was strictly dependent on the presence of GM-CSF, interleukin-3, or thrombopoietin (Tpo). Independent of the cytokine, the cells constitutively expressed a well-defined megakaryocyte phenotype, with 70-95% of the cells positive for CD4, CD34, and platelet glycoproteins Ib, IIb, and IIIa. Fewer than 10% of the cells had detectable erythroid glycophorin A. Erythropoiesis was induced in HU-3 parental cells and five clones harvested from culture medium containing GM-CSF by replacement of the growth-promoting cytokine with stem cell factor (SCF) and erythropoietin (Epo). During the first week of induction, the proliferating cells slowly acquired erythroid markers. Concomitant with a maturational growth arrest during the second week, there was a rapid accumulation of gamma and beta globin chains and benzidine reactive hemoglobin, as well as a distinct erythroid morphology. The culture declined after 12 days because of the transient effect of SCF in maintaining viability. Parental and cloned cells cultured for 7 days in Tpo-supplemented medium responded to the synergistic growth effect of SCF and Epo but were markedly suppressed in their yield of hemoglobinized cells. Recycling of the cells in GM-CSF for 4 days did not reverse the suppressive effect of Tpo. These results suggest a role for Tpo in the lineage commitment of erythromegakaryocytic progenitors by suppressing the erythroid potential. With its constitutive megakaryocyte phenotype and inducible erythroid potential, the self-renewing bipotential HU-3 cell line may represent one of the earliest stages in megakaryocytopoiesis before irreversible lineage commitment. The suppressive effect of Tpo on the erythroid potential of cloned HU-3 cells enhances the value of this cell line for deciphering the molecular and cellular events during lineage commitment of progenitor cells.","['Department of Medicine, Allegheny University of the Health Sciences, Philadelphia, PA 19102, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with NHL (52) or CLL (5) were treated with radiolabeled Lym-1 antibody between 1985 and 1994. Influence of response to treatment on survival was examined directly and was also adjusted for other factors previously found to be significant predictors of survival. A multivariate model that was based on baseline Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) predicted response and survival and was used to define risk groups. Proportional-hazards, Kaplan-Meier, and Landmark models were used to evaluate parameters for their ability to predict outcome. RESULTS: By using a proportional-hazards model with response as a time-dependent variable, overall response (P < 0.001) and complete response (P = 0.006) were predictive of increased survival in univariate analyses. Overall response continued to be significant (P = 0.02) in multivariate analyses, even when risk groups that also predicted survival were included. Median survival of responders was 84 weeks, whereas that of nonresponders was 22 weeks when the Landmark method, based on response status at 16 weeks from start of therapy, was used to generate survival curves. CONCLUSIONS: Response to treatment with radiolabeled Lym-1 was associated with increased survival, even when adjusted for baseline clinical parameters that also predicted for survival. The results provide the first unbiased evidence for survival effects of RIT in patients.","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, USA.']",,['CA 47829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, patients with splenomegaly have been ineligible for some trials of radioimmunotherapy because of the assumption that they would not benefit. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with NHL and five with CLL received an initial dose of 131I-Lym-1 ranging from 740-8140 MBq. Six patients had prior splenectomy. The remaining 48 patients had spleen volumes ranging from 140-2830 ml determined using x-ray computed tomography. Medical Internal Radiation Dose Committee formalism was used to determine dosimetry, and spleen volume was used to adjust the S value for the spleen of each patient. RESULTS: Spleen radiation dose decreased as spleen volume increased, although there was a positive correlation (r = 0.75) between spleen volume and spleen cumulated activity. There was no clear relationship between spleen volume and tumor radiation dose, although tumor radiation doses were low in five patients whose spleen volumes were greater than or equal to 970 ml. There was no apparent relationship between spleen volume and therapeutic response to 131I-Lym-1. Two of five patients whose spleen volumes were greater than or equal to 970 ml responded despite low tumor radiation doses, whereas two of six patients with prior splenectomy did not respond. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide no clear evidence that patients with splenomegaly should be excluded from radioimmunotherapy trials because of the assumption that they will not benefit. Splenomegaly was associated with decreased radiation dose to the spleen, and to tumors only for extraordinarily large spleens.","['University of California at Davis, School of Medicine, Sacramento, USA.']",,['CA 47829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a Phase II detoxifying enzyme that can detoxify chemically reactive metabolites, and may be important in an early cellular defense against tumorigenesis. DT-diaphorase is also an activating enzyme for bioreductive antitumor agents like mitomycin C (MMC) and EO9. DT-diaphorase is induced in many tissues by a wide variety of compounds including dithiolethiones and isothiocyanates. Dithiolethiones are chemoprotective agents against a variety of chemical carcinogens in animal models, and the dithiolethione analogue, oltipraz, is currently in Phase I and Phase II clinical chemoprevention trials. Similarly, the isothiocyanate derivative, sulforaphane, blocks the formation of carcinogen-induced mammary tumors in rats. The low toxicity of these inducers of DT-diaphorase makes them suitable for use as chemopreventive agents in high-risk individuals. Cells with elevated DT-diaphorase levels are generally more sensitive to bioreductive antitumor agents. Thus, we suggested that the antitumor efficacy of bioreductive agents can be enhanced by selective induction of DT-diaphorase in tumor cells compared with normal cells. We showed that 1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) can increase the level of DT-diaphorase activity and the cytotoxic activity of bioreductive agents in mouse lymphoma cells without increasing these activities in normal mouse marrow cells. D3T also increased DT-diaphorase activity in 24 of 33 human tumor cell lines representing nine tissue types with no obvious relationships between the tumor type, or the base level of DT-diaphorase activity, and the ability to increase enzyme activity. A series of dithiolethione analogues and dietary components were also shown to be good inducers of DT-diaphorase in human tumor cells. D3T increased DT-diaphorase activity in normal human bone marrow and kidney cells but the increases were small in these cells. Combination treatment with D3T and EO9 increased cell kill in HL-60 human leukemia cells compared with EO9 alone, but had no effect on EO9 toxicity in normal human kidney cells. Similarly, D3T increased tumor cell kill by EO9 in H661 human lung cancer cells and by MMC in T47D human breast cancer cells. Thus, inducers of DT-diaphorase may play an important role in cancer chemoprevention programs and may also be useful in enhancing the antitumor efficacy of bioreductive agents.","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Manitoba Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation, Winnipeg, Canada. begleit@cc.umanitoba.ca']",,['CA39416/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],81,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gadolinium complexes of folate-conjugated dendrimer-chelates increased the longitudinal relaxation rate of tumor cells expressing the high-affinity folate receptor, hFR. The coupling of folate to polymeric chelates, composed of a dendrimer backbone, targets these chelates to endogenous folate binding proteins. These proteins exist in both the serum of patients with cancer and on the cell surface of many human cancers of epithelial origin. METHODS: The authors attached folic acid to a generation four ammonia core polyamidoamine dendrimer. The folate-dendrimer was reacted with 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-6-methyl-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid to form the polymeric chelate f-PAMAM-TU-DTPA. For fluorescent studies, the generation four dendrimer was reacted with fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate and carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester, followed by capping the remaining amines with succinic anhydride. RESULTS: The study results show that cells accumulate the folate-conjugated dendrimer in a receptor specific manner. Tumor cells expressing the high-affinity folate receptor showed a 650% increase in the mean fluorescence. This increase occurred with a rapid rise to 325%, followed by a slow increase to 650%. It required both the expression of the hFR and the coupling of folic acid to the dendrimer. Excess free folic acid inhibited the binding of the folate conjugated polymer. Fluorescent microscopic study showed that the folate-conjugated dendrimer binds to the cell surface and is accumulated within the cells. Treatment of tumor cells that express the hFR with gadolinium complexes of the folate-conjugated polymeric chelate increases the longitudinal relaxation rate by 110%. This increase was inhibited by an excess of free folic acid. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that folate-conjugated magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents represent a promising new approach to tumor targeting.","['Biomedical Magnetic Resonance Laboratory, College of Medicine, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA.']",,"['1-R29-CA61918/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2-P41-RR05964-06/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '5-P41-RR05964/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Class I Hox proteins bind DNA cooperatively with both Pbx proteins and oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1, suggesting that leukemogenesis by E2a-Pbx1 and Hox proteins may alter transcription of cellular genes regulated by Pbx-Hox motifs. Likewise, in murine myeloid leukemia, transcriptional coactivation of Meis1 with HoxA7/A9 suggests that Meis1-HoxA7/9 heterodimers may evoke aberrant gene transcription. Here, we demonstrate that both Meis1 and its relative, pKnox1, dimerize with Pbx1 on the same TGATTGAC motif selected by dimers of Pbx proteins and unidentified partner(s) in nuclear extracts, including those from t(1;19) pre-B cells. Outside their homeodomains, Meis1 and pKnox1 were highly conserved only in two motifs required for cooperativity with Pbx1. Like the unidentified endogenous partner(s), both Meis1 and pKnox1 failed to dimerize significantly with E2a-Pbx1. The Meis1/pKnox1-interaction domain in Pbx1 resided predominantly in a conserved N-terminal Pbx domain deleted in E2a-Pbx1. Thus, the leukemic potential of E2a-Pbx1 may require abrogation of its interaction with members of the Meis and pKnox families of transcription factors, permitting selective targeting of genes regulated by Pbx-Hox complexes. In addition, because most motifs bound by Pbx-Meis1/pKnox1 were not bound by Pbx1-Hox complexes, the leukemic potential of Meis1 in myeloid leukemias may involve shifting Pbx proteins from promoters containing Pbx-Hox motifs to those containing Pbx-Meis motifs.","['Department of Pathology, University of California at San Diego School of Medicine, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. pknoepfler@ucsd.edu']",,"['R01 CA056876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2 PO1 CA50528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC25052,,,,,,,,,,

Both TDT and polymerase I strongly reacted with fragmented nuclei of apoptotic MOLT-16 and Jurkat cells, but only polymerase I strongly reacted with nonfragmented nuclei of early apoptotic cells. Anti-Fas MAb-treated MOLT-4 cells showed morphological changes corresponding to early apoptosis and were strongly positive for polymerase I only. MOLT-16 and Jurkat cells treated with anti-Fas MAb and inhibitors of endonuclease and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase showed the morphology of early apoptosis but were not strongly stained by TDT. Because DNA polymerase I has nick-translation activity, it is possible that DNA polymerase I reaction is positive in early apoptotic cells by detecting single-strand DNA cleavage, which occurs before extensive oligonucleosomal DNA cleavage and late morphological changes of apoptosis in leukemia cell lines. Although TDT is widely used to stain apoptotic cells, DNA polymerase I may be more applicable in special cases of apoptosis, in which cells undergo single-strand rather than double-strand DNA breaks. However, the procedure has limitations, such as the necessity to use cell smears for comparison with the TDT reaction.

Experimental animal models, such as transgenic mice, have demonstrated unambiguously that Bcr/Abl is capable of inducing leukemogenesis. The adaptor molecule Crkl is a major in vivo substrate of the deregulated Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase and functions as a molecular link with other signaling proteins. While associated in vivo with Bcr/Abl through its SH3 domain, Crkl can interact simultaneously via its SH2 domain with other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Here we report the identification of prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with a molecular mass of approximately 110 kDa, which bind specifically to the Crkl SH2 domain in leukemic tissues of P190BCR/ABL transgenic mice. We demonstrate that these proteins are identical to Hef1/Cas-L, which is related to p130(Cas). The proto-oncoprotein p120(Cbl) and Hef1, but not p130(Cas), were detectably phosphorylated on tyrosine in P190Bcr/Abl-expressing leukemic cells and were found in complex with Crkl, showing the existence of protein complexes in P190Bcr/Abl leukemic cells, consisting of P190Bcr/Abl, Crkl, and Hef1 or p120(Cbl). This supports a model in which Crkl acts as mediator between Bcr/Abl and downstream effectors. Since Hef1 is involved in the beta1-integrin signaling pathway, our study demonstrates that Bcr/Abl could specifically interfere with normal beta1-integrin signaling.","['Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Department of Pathology, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90027, USA.']",,"['CA 47456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 50248/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find that several hundred base pairs at each end of the viral DNA are organized in a large nucleoprotein complex, which we call the intasome. This structure is not formed when pre-integration complexes are made by infecting cells with integrase-minus virus, demonstrating a requirement for integrase. In contrast, footprinting of internal regions of the viral DNA did not reveal significant differences between pre-integration complexes with and without integrase. Treatment with high salt disrupts the intasome in parallel with loss of intermolecular integration activity. We show that a cellular factor is required for reconstitution of the intasome. Finally, we demonstrate that DNA-protein interactions involving extensive regions at the ends of the viral DNA are functionally important for retroviral DNA integration activity. Current in vitro integration systems utilizing purified integrase lack the full fidelity of the in vivo reaction.

The pseudoknot melts in two steps, corresponding to its two helical stems. The total enthalpy of denaturation is approximately 170 kcal/mol, approximately the value expected for the secondary structure. At low salt concentrations (<50 mM KCl) the unfolding transitions are not two-state, but they approach two-state behavior at higher salt concentrations. The structure is preferentially stabilized by smaller alkali metal ions (Li+ > Na+ > K+ > Rb+ > Cs+) and by NH4+; the same preferences are exhibited by one of the stems in the context of a hairpin. Divalent metal ions are not required to fold the pseudoknot but do stabilize it further. To examine divalent ion effects over a wide concentration range, urea was used to lower the RNA unfolding temperature and was shown not to affect characteristics of the pseudoknot unfolding in other respects.

Although this complication is mainly dependent on donor-derived T lymphocytes, very little information is available concerning the mechanism of lethality. In this study, we investigated both the expression of Fas/Fas-ligand (FasL) and lymphocyte subset reconstitution in patients who underwent HLA-matched related allogeneic BMT (n = 16) and normal donors (n = 10), and several distinct features were observed. First, the reconstitutions of CD3+ and CD56+ cells were different between the aGVHD+ and aGVHD- group. In particular, the percentage of CD3-CD56+ cells was significantly decreased in patients with aGVHD (P < 0.01). Second, the expansion of CD8+ (P = 0.01) and CD8+ CD28- T cells (P = 0.03) was a characteristic finding in patients with aGVHD. Finally, we found that the percentages of Fas+CD8+, Fas+HLA-DR+ and FasL+ CD8+ cells were significantly increased. Fas antigen was highly coexpressed on most of the lymphocyte subsets, especially on CD8+ cells (P < 0.01), and also, significantly higher coexpression of FasL on CD8+ cells was found in patients with aGVHD (P < 0.01). In summary, an increase in the percentage of CD8+ cells which express Fas and its ligand in patients with aGVHD after BMT points to a possible role for the Fas/FasL pathway in the effector phase of aGVHD.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Community periodontal index treatment necessity (CPITN), dental caries, missing or filled permanent teeth (DMFT) and dento-facial alterations according to WHO criteria were registered and evaluated.

Therefore, we isolated CD34-positive cells from leukapheresis samples of seven CML patients after induction therapy. These cells were analyzed using the colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and long-term culture-initiating cell (LTCIC) assays. In addition, we analyzed frequency and clonogenicity of single stem cells using the LTCIC assay at limiting dilution. Individual colonies derived from these assays were subsequently analyzed for the presence of the bcr-abl gene with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and for the presence of bcr-abl mRNA with RT-PCR. We compared these results with the cytogenetic analysis of the leukapheresis material. Molecular analysis of individual colonies correlated well with the results of cytogenetic analysis. However, in nine out of 18 samples, cytogenetic analysis exclusively demonstrated the presence of either Philadelphia chromosome-positive or -negative cells whereas with the molecular analysis of individual colonies tumor contamination or the presence of residual normal cells could be substantiated. We concluded that molecular analysis of individual colonies should be employed to further optimize induction protocols. With regard to stem cell mobilization we demonstrated that about 67 CFU-GM colonies and clusters were generated by one single LTCIC both for the CML samples and the samples obtained from patients with non-hematologic malignancy. This number is important since until now most centres use a number of four colonies and clusters generated by one LTCIC. Dividing the CFU-GM output in the LTCIC assay by four to determine LTCIC frequency could thus lead to an almost 20-fold overestimation of the LTCIC frequency. It is concluded that stem cell frequency analysis is an important tool with regard to the interpretation of mobilization protocols.","['Department of Hematology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 1985, we have intensified therapy for infants with ALL by including a month of high dose multiagent chemotherapy after remission induction. METHODS: Between 1985 and 1995, we treated 23 infants (age < 12 months). We compared the presenting characteristics and outcomes of these infants with the 11 infants treated on our protocols between 1973 and 1985, an era prior to the intensification of therapy. Available bone marrow samples from infants treated since 1985 were analyzed for the presence of MLL gene rearrangements by Southern blot analyses and for TEL-AML1 gene fusion by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 5.6 years, the 50-month event free survival (EFS) (+/- standard error) for the 23 infants was 54 +/- 11%, a significant improvement (P = 0.001) compared with the outcome for the 11 infants treated on our protocols prior to 1985 (EFS = 9 +/- 9%). Of the seven infants found to have a rearranged MLL gene, three (43%) remained in first complete remission. None of the nine infant bone marrow specimens tested had evidence of TEL-AML1 gene fusion. The intensified therapy was complicated by a high incidence of infections, including septicemia in 52% of patients and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis in 22% of patients. Late effects identified in the 13 long term survivors (median age, 6 years) included developmental delay and learning disabilities of varying severity (82% of evaluable patients), asymptomatic cataracts (67%), asymptomatic echocardiographic abnormalities (30%), obesity (27%), and short stature (18%). CONCLUSIONS: Intensification of therapy significantly improved the EFS of infants with ALL compared with previous, less intensive regimens and with the experience of other investigators. Future treatment for infants should attempt to improve efficacy while minimizing toxicity.","[""Children's Hospital, the Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['Cancer. 1998 Sep 1;83(5):1055-7.

The mechanism of activation in most cases has been due to point mutations at critical domains responsible for guanine nucleotide binding. These changes alter the conformation of the protein resulting in insensitivity of the protein to the GTPase activating protein which normally hydrolyses the active p21RAS GTP-bound form to the inactive GDP-bound form. RAS genes have potent effects on the differentiation and proliferation program of cells. The mechanism induced depends on the context in which RAS is found as well as its mutational status and indeed which RAS gene family member is involved. RAS mutations have been described early in the disease process in haematologically normal individuals at risk of mutations induced by either occupational hazard exposure, such as benzene, or of secondary disease after chemotherapy for a previous malignancy. It also been associated with disease progression from myelodysplasia (MDS) to acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), but it has also been described to be lost upon disease progression, thus showing that RAS mutations are unlikely to be initiating events or at least not required for maintenance of disease. As RAS appears to be involved in primary and secondary myeloid leukaemias, it is a good candidate for gene targeted therapeutic intervention. Studies to target RAS either directly or indirectly by interfering in the RAS pathway are underway. Clinical trials with a peptide RAS vaccine are also ongoing in solid tumours. This report seeks to review the evidence for RAS involvement as oncogenes, focusing on MDS, the reasons as to why the hot spots of codons 12/13 and 61 are particularly potent in activating the transformation potential of RAS and the different approaches being undertaken to translate laboratory findings into therapeutic reality.","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK.']",,,86,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to analyse the incidence of malignancies in a cohort of patients with sarcoidosis by linkage to a nationwide population based cancer register. METHODS: The cohort comprised 254 patients followed for a median of 25 years until death, emigration, or 31 December 1992, whichever came first. The expected number of cancer cases was calculated using the annual age and sex specific cancer rates from the Danish Cancer Registry. RESULTS: Thirty six cancers were registered, three of which were misclassified as sarcoidosis, leaving 33 cancers compared with 23 expected (standardised incidence ratio (SIR) = 1.4; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.0). Five lung cancers were observed compared with 2.5 expected, yielding an SIR of 2.0 (95% CI 0.7 to 4.7). There was no incidence of lymphoma and only one case of leukaemia. There was a significant excess number of pharyngeal cancers based on two cases (SIR = 15.4; 95% CI 1.7 to 56). CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the theory of an association between sarcoidosis and malignancy, and the main reason other studies have shown such an association is most likely to have been due to selection bias and misclassification.","['Danish Cancer Society, Division for Cancer Epidemiology, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['Thorax. 1998 Jul;53(7):625-6.

Hence, mechanisms that maintain the integrity of the endothelium are of interest in physiological and pathological states. In this study we show that apoptosis induced by growth factor and serum deprivation of endothelial cells occurs at all phases of the cell cycle and can be blocked by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) independently of its mitogenic activity. As the Bcl-2 family of proteins plays a prominent role in regulating cell survival, we attempted to identify Bcl-2 homologues expressed in endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that, in addition to the previously identified A1, four other members of the Bcl-2 family, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-X(L), and Bax, are expressed in endothelial cells. Of these family members, only Bcl-2 is induced by FGF-2. Overexpression of Bcl-2, using a retroviral vector, protects endothelial cells from serum and growth factor deprivation. There is no difference in FGF-2-induced proliferation between Bcl-2-overexpressing cells and those transduced with the empty retroviral vector. At early time points Bcl-2 is not up-regulated, but FGF-2 still has a protective effect. However, FGF-2 protects only adherent endothelial cells but not those that are cultured in suspension. The early effect of FGF-2 is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation but not on activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Thus, FGF-2 inhibits endothelial cell apoptosis by Bcl-2-dependent and independent mechanisms.","['McDonald Research Laboratories, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",,"['HL 18645/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 47151/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1858363,,,,,,,,,,

This ability is dependent on the environment of the peripheral nerve and an intrinsic capacity of motor neurons for regrowth. We report here the identification, using a technique known as messenger RNA differential display, of an extracellular signalling molecule, previously described as the pancreatic secreted protein Reg-2, that is expressed solely in regenerating and developing rat motor and sensory neurons. Axon-stimulated Schwann cell proliferation is necessary for successful regeneration, and we show that Reg-2 is a potent Schwann cell mitogen in vitro. In vivo, Reg-2 protein is transported along regrowing axons and inhibition of Reg-2 signalling significantly retards the regeneration of Reg-2-containing axons. During development, Reg-2 production by motor and sensory neurons is regulated by contact with peripheral targets. Strong candidates for peripheral factors regulating Reg-2 production are cytokines of the LIF/CNTF family, because Reg-2 is not expressed in developing motor or sensory neurons of mice carrying a targeted disruption of the LIF receptor gene, a common component of the receptor complexes for all of the LIF/CNTF family.","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK. rlivesey@mail.tcd.ie']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that elevated birth weight is associated with an increased risk of diagnosis-specific and age-specific groups of childhood cancers. METHODS: A case-control study, using a large Children's Cancer Group database, examined birth weight as a risk factor for childhood cancer. Birth weight information for the index child was available for 3711 cases and 816 control subjects. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Wilms' tumor, and neuroblastoma with increasing birth weight (p, trend = 0.006, 0.003, and 0.001, respectively). A statistically significant decreased risk of cancer was observed for soft tissue sarcoma (p, trend = 0.04). When data were stratified on the basis of age at diagnosis, many of these associations were apparent for children whose disease was diagnosed before the age of 2 years. Moreover, for acute myeloid leukemia, age at diagnosis was an important effect modifier. For children with acute myeloid leukemia whose disease was diagnosed before 2 years of age, there was a statistically significant increased risk with high birth weight (odds ratio = 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 5.5); there was no increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia with high birth weight noted for children whose disease was diagnosed after 2 years of age (odds ratio 1.3, 95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.2). CONCLUSIONS: Biologic studies are needed to address why high birth weight may increase risk (particularly at younger ages) of development of certain cancers.","['Department of Family Practice, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']",,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of action for cell death has been attributed to intracellular accumulation of dGTP, a potent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase and subsequently DNA synthesis, in thymocytes and T-cells but not B-cells. However, the mode of cell death has not been determined to be either necrosis or apoptosis. To examine the involvement of apoptosis in T-cells following PNP inhibition, MOLT-4 cells, a human T cell leukemia cell line, were co-treated with the PNP inhibitor, CI-1000 (2-amino 3,5-dihydro-7-(3-thienylmethyl)-4H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]-pyrimidin-4-one HCl), and 2'-deoxyguanosine (dGuo) which resulted in a concentration-dependent loss of cell viability (trypan blue) and inhibition of tritiated thymidine ([3H]-TdR) uptake. Staining of cells with the DNA dye Hoechst 33,258 showed nuclear morphology characteristic of apoptosis. Western blots (24 h lysates) were probed with antibodies against several proteins implicated in apoptosis. Anti-PARP revealed the presence of an 85 kD PARP breakdown product while, anti-alpha-spectrin revealed the accumulation a 120 kD breakdown product, both suggestive of CPP32 cleavage (caspase-3; an ICE-like cysteine protease). Western blots also detected the loss of the intact 32 kD caspase-3 isoform, a biochemical event associated with caspase-3 activation. Corresponding fluorometric activity assays detected a marked increase in caspase-3-like activity using the substrate Ac-DEVD-MCA. Lastly, a pan caspase inhibitor (Z-D-DCB) and 2'-deoxycytidine (dCyd), which is known to prevent dGTP accumulation following PNP inhibition, were able to prevent cell death and all indicators of caspase-3-like activity in MOLT-4 cells co-treated with dGuo and CI-1000. In summary, we provided several lines of evidence for the role of apoptosis and the contribution of caspase-3-like proteases in T-cell death following PNP inhibition.","['Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research, Warner-Lambert Company, Department of Immunopathology, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, USA.

While studies have looked at octreotide use in the setting of pancreatitis due to chronic alcohol use or trauma, little is known of its role in management of drug induced acute pancreatitis; particularly in the pediatric setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present a case of a 5 1/2-year-old white female who developed severe, necrotizing, hemorrhagic pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation secondary to L-asparaginase use as a part of her therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). She was managed initially with intravenous fluids, bowel rest, nasogastric suctioning, parenteral narcotices, and broad spectrum antibiotics. In addition, within 12 hours of admission to The Children's Hospital (TCH) in Denver, Colorado, she began therapy with octreotide (5 micrograms/kg/day IV divided b.i.d.). With this management, her pseudocyst decompressed without need for surgical intervention, her pancreatitis fully resolved, and she recovered full pancreatic function without any long-term sequelae. CONCLUSION: Use of octreotide may have served a role in limiting the severity of the disease process in this case. Further studies need to be done to verify its usefulness in this setting.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, USA.']",['Med Pediatr Oncol. 1998 Aug;31(2):127.

The patient showed the simultaneous presence at diagnosis of a 46 cytogenetic line in the spinal fluid and a 47 (+8) cell line in the BM, present in the great majority of the metaphases examined. DISCUSSION: This observation allows hypotheses on the relationship between BM and CNS disease in AML. Regardless of the pathogenetic mechanism, the cytogenetic findings of the present case clearly suggest that the leukemic population in the CNS compartment represents a less malignant cell process compared to the BM leukemic population. This easily fits in with the usually less malignant course of CNSL in AML.

PROCEDURE AND RESULTS: We utilized the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS; Aprex Corporation, Fremont, CA) for the study. Compliance was defined as the number of days doses were taken as a percentage of the total number of days doses were prescribed during the study period. The mean age of the patients was 7.3 years (range 2.6-17.2 (years). Patients were evaluated for a mean of 44 days (range 15-94 days). Thirty-three percent of patients (8) took less than 90% and 17% (4) took less than 80% of their prescribed pills. Eight patients were also evaluated for a difference in compliance between morning and evening administration. For the comparison of compliance between a morning vs. an evening schedule a tren toward improved compliance in the evening was found. Five patients had an increase and one patient a decrease in compliance with an evening schedule (differences ranged from 0.2% to 51.3%), with two patients having 100% compliance on both schedules.

Other parameters which may influence the prognosis include age, French-American-British-type, clinical variables and possibly the expression of certain immunophenotypic surface makers. However, only rarely has the expression of these markers been analyzed in multivariate models including the information from cytogenetics and clinical variables. We conducted a retrospective study of 117 consecutive adult patients with de novo AML diagnosed and treated in our institution during a 6-year period. Following standard induction chemotherapy with daunomycin and cytosine arabinoside 75 patients (64%) achieved complete remission (CR). The overall 5 year survival rate was 23% and, for patients achieving CR, 30%. When all patients were analyzed age, chromosomal aberration and lack of CD33 expression were of independent prognostic value. The overall 5 year survival rate was 28% for patients aged 55 years or younger, 25% for patients aged 56-65 years and 4% for those > 65 years, P = 0.041. Patients with good-risk chromosomal abnormalities presented an overall 5 year survival of 36%, compared to 25% in patients with normal karyotype, 22% in patients with intermediate risk abnormalities and 5% in patients with poor-risk abnormalities, P = 0.004. Patients with CD33+ myeloblasts had an overall survival of 25% at 5 years compared to 0% in the CD33- patients, P = 0.021. Analysis of the expression of CD7, CD34 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase on myeloblasts had no impact on overall survival in a multivariate analysis. Thus, this study confirmed the prognostic value of age and cytogenetic risk group and defined CD33 as a novel factor of independent prognostic importance in adult de novo AML.","['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Finsen Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conformational alterations of mitochondria induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), and the association with TNF alpha-induced apoptosis, were, therefore, studied in the human acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) cell line, CCRF-CEM and its vinblastine-resistant CEM/VLB100 cell line by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The CEM/VLB100 cell line possessed more condensed (C phase) mitochondria in the resting state compared with its parental cell line, consistent with increased activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Following exposure to TNF alpha, conformational alterations of mitochondria occurred in both apoptotic and non-apoptotic cells. Orthodox (O phase) mitochondria in non-apoptotic cells underwent C-phase, transitional O-phase and slightly swollen (S-phase) conformational changes. TNF alpha-induced mitochondrial swelling was a late event and was found to a far lesser extent than mitochondrial condensation. No swollen mitochondria were observed in apoptotic cells. Ultracondensed (UC phase) mitochondria were observed in cells undergoing both TNF alpha-induced and spontaneous apoptosis and were seen when TNF alpha-induced apoptosis was inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3MA). The structural integrity of UC phase mitochondria persisted through the apoptotic process. We conclude that TNF alpha-induced mitochondrial swelling and apoptosis are separate events. Mitochondrial ultracondensation is associated with the processes signalling apoptosis and is not a result of TNF alpha-induced apoptotic shrinkage.","['Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, U.K.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efflux assays are used to get an impression of functional resistance in those cells. Dyes like rhodamine 123 or 3'3'-diethyloxocarbocyanine iodide are commonly used for this purpose. A major known disadvantage is that dyes do not behave like cytotoxic drugs in efflux experiments. Assays using the self fluorescence of drugs like anthracyclines can not reveal a real impression of intracellular or effluxed drug due to quenching of the drug fluorescence in the nuclei of the cells. We have developed a reproducible and sensitive assay for direct and quantitative determination of drug efflux out of blast cells. This was done by a novel double radioactive labelling using a 3H-labelled drug and 14C-labelled sucrose as extracellular marker. So this assay can be applied to every drug of interest. Quenching of fluorescence is also by-passed with this technique as well as protracting washing or silicon oil procedures. As a model system we used the T-lymphoblastoid cell line CCRF CEM and its resistant sublines vincristine 100 and adriamycin 5000. The results were also transferable to clinical specimens of leukemic patients. In conclusion our assay may be used for precise and direct efflux measurement of a broad range of anti-cancer drugs in clinical MDR evaluation.,"['Medizinische Klinik I, Universitatsklinikum, Dresden, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,['Leuk Res 1998 Jan;22(1):101'],,,,,

It results in the fusion of the FEL (AF-4) gene on chromosome band 4q21 with the HRX (MLL) gene on chromosome band 11q23. This translocation results in the expression of fusion transcripts from both translocated chromosomes, with the derivative 11 product (fusing the amino-terminal third of the Hrx protein to the C-terminal two-thirds of the Fel protein) thought to be involved in leukemic transformation. The mechanism of transformation by Hrx-Fel in leukemic cells, however, is unknown and the specific leukemogenic contributions of Fel have not been defined. In this study, we demonstrate that Fel is capable of activating transcription from a minimal adenoviral E1b promoter as a Gal4-Fel fusion protein in transient transcriptional assays. The Fel transactivating sequences were localized to amino acids 365-572 which are consistently retained by Hrx-Fel fusion proteins created by t(4;11) translocations in leukemias. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the transactivation properties of Fel vary in different cell types. While Gal4-Fel constructs strongly activated transcription in Cos-7 cells and the MCF-7 breast tumor cell line, they displayed low to no activity in the precursor B-cell line REH, breast tumor cell line Gl-101A and epithelial-derived A431 cells.

In an attempt to minimize the non-hematologic toxicity and obtain a potent antileukemic effect, MSKCC activated a pilot study in previously treated adult ALL, using HD-ARA-C combined with idarubicin administered as a single high-dose infusion. We herein report our experience with a series of pediatric and adult high risk ALL and NHL patients treated with the protocol above, which confirms its feasibility, response rate and individual compliance. METHODS: In a clinical phase II study the combination of a single high dose (HD) idarubicin and HD cytosine-arabinoside (ARA-C), as designed at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, was applied to 70 adults and children with refractory or early relapse acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Therapy consisted of HD-ARA-C 3 g/m2/d on days 1-5, idarubicin 40 mg/m2 on day 3, prophylactic intrathecal methotrexate on days 1 and 4, and G-CSF 5 mg/kg/d s.c. from day 7 to hematopoietic reconstitution (PMN > 0.5 x 10(9)/L). RESULTS: Fifty-five of the 70 patients (78%) achieved complete remission (CR), four died in aplasia due to infection and 11 were non-responders. Recovery of blood counts occurred at a median of 21 days from the start of treatment. Non-hematologic side effects were extremely limited and consisted predominantly of infections. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In view of the highly unfavorable series of patients selected, this study confirms the feasibility and antileukemic activity of the HD-idarubicin + HD- ARA-C combination in patients with refractory and early relapse ALL and NHL. The excellent tolerance to this regimen does not preclude bone marrow transplantation as post-remission treatment.","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty-six AML patients, median age 66, with progressive disease and high tumor burden received idarubicin 8 mg/sqm i.v. d 1,3,5; cytarabine 200 mg/sqm by continuous i.v. infusion d 1-7; etoposide 60 mg/sqm i.v. d 1-5. A second course with the same drugs was planned irrespective of complete remission (CR) achievement. No consolidation was given; 44% had a documented preexisting myelodysplasia, 45% had a documented preexisting myelodysplasia, 45% presented with fever. Promyelocytic leukemias were excluded. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (53%) achieved CR and 9 PR for an overall response rate of 67%. Nine of them (13%) died early or during the aplastic phase. Preexisting myelodysplasia had no significant impact on CR achievement. Resistant disease was associated with CD7 phenotype and unfavorable karyotype. Overall survival and disease free survival were 14 and 13 months, respectively. The major toxicity consisted of infectious complications (WHO > 2 in 24% of patients). Six patients died for infection, 2 for heart failure, 1 for pulmonary embolism. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This induction regimen with attenuated doses of idarubicin is feasible and effective, but long-term survival remains an unresolved problem. Alternative post remission approaches are advisable in the aim of improving the remission duration.","['Divisione di Ematologia, Policlinico Careggi, Florence, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We set out to evaluate in a multicenter study the efficacy and tolerability of an intensive therapy with IDA and Ara-C in patients with RAEB and RAEB-t, the rate and duration of CR and the overall survival in adults treated with full doses and in the elderly treated with lower doses; furthermore, we investigated the efficacy of low-dose maintenance chemotherapy. METHODS: Pretreated adult patients with de novo RAEB and RAEB-t, meeting at least one of the following criteria, were included: neutrophils < 0.5 x 10(9)/L or moderate neutropenia with infectious episodes, platelets < 30 x 10(9)/L or moderate thrombocytopenia but with bleeding symptoms, transfusion > 4 red cell units/months, rapid increase of bone marrow blasts. Induction treatment consisted of a cycle with IDA and Ara-C. Adult patients less than 65 years old were treated with the following doses: Ara-C 1 g/m2/day i.v. 6-hour infusion, on days 1-4, IDA 10 mg/m2/day i.v., on days 1-3. Elderly patients (> or = 65 yrs) were treated with lower doses: Ara-C 1 g/m2/day 6 hours infusion, on days 1 and 2, IDA 10 mg/m2/day i.v., on days 1 and 2. Responders followed a consolidation course identical to induction. RESULTS: From February 1994 to February 1997, 25 patients were enrolled, 20 males and 5 females aged between 22 and 76, 10 were > or = 65 years old, 7 had RAEB and 18 had RAEB-t. Twelve cases (48%) achieved complete remission (CR), 7 cases (28%) achieved partial remission, 4 patients were resistant and two patients (8%) died during the aplastic phase. A significantly higher CR rate was found in younger patients (p = 0.036), while gender, FAB subtype, presence of Auer rods, cytogenetic findings, and the interval from diagnosis to treatment did not significantly influence CR achievement. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that in de novo RAEB and RAEB-t, the employed treatment with IDA and Ara-C is associated with satisfactory frequency of response with acceptable toxicity.","['Medicina Interna ed Oncologia Medica, Universita di Pavia, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We enrolled 25 previous responder patients in standard induction therapy to receive maintenance oral IDA 5 mg daily on days 1-14 at 2-week intervals for at least 6 months. We also evaluated the cell-cycle and apoptosis in leukemic cells from patients after IDA administration and, as a control, from HL60 lines exposed to IDA and IDAol in vitro. RESULTS: Long-term long-dose IDA was well-tolerated. Neutrophil and platelet count never below under 1 x 10(9)/L and 50 x 10(9)/L respectively in CR patients, and no infectious complications were encountered. Non-hematological toxicity was also acceptable: easily controlled nausea and vomiting, non-recorded diarrhea or mucositis were reported. The convenience of oral administration contributed to excellent compliance. DNA analysis performed in vivo after IDA and IDAol exposure showed an increase of G2/M cell frequencies and evidence of sub-G1 peak. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, long-term low doses of oral IDA would appear valuable as a maintenance regimen for elderly patients. Our results seem to confirm the preliminary hypothesis that IDA + IDAol induce an increase of apoptosis in leukemic cells.","['Cattedra Divisione di Ematologia con Trapianto di Midollo, Universita di Palermo, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main objective of the study was to assess the influence of radiation exposure on existing levels of cancer morbidity and mortality. Time trends and relative population risks were analysed. Based on this analysis, it was concluded that the current levels of morbidity from cancers among the populations residing in the studied areas were primarily a result of a complex of factors which predated the exposure from the Chernobyl accident. However, there seems to be an unfavourable trend concerning malignant neoplasms of the respiratory organs for women residing in the contaminated areas. To date, no statistically significant effect of radiation on cancer morbidity (except for thyroid cancer in women) has been noted. The levels of cancer morbidity and mortality in the contaminated areas generally reflect the changes in cancer incidence in the oblast as a whole. The findings are consistent with international data on latent periods for the induction of radiogenic cancers and the biological effects for similar levels of exposure to populations residing in contaminated territories. Further studies are necessary in order to monitor possible effects that are related to the accident.","['Medical Radiological Research Centre of RAMS, Obninsk, Russian Federation.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a good response to high-dose treatment of leukemias has additionally been attributed to a so-called low deamination phenotype of cytarabine inactivation. Consequently, these findings would support plasma level monitoring of cytarabine and its metabolite uracil arabinoside in high-dose cytarabine regimens. This pharmacokinetic study presents data attempting to reevaluate these observations. Thirty-seven patients were treated by 3-h high-dose cytarabine infusions (9 patients 1000 mg/m2, 28 patients 3000 mg/m2) as part of their treatment for acute leukemia. Serial blood samples during and post infusion were analysed for cytarabine (araC) and its deamination product uracil arabinoside (araU) using HPLC with UV-detection.

On the other hand, JSB1 MoAb was tested in 173 of these samples. At onset, PGP was detected in 57.4% of cases with C219 and 75.9% of cases with JSB1. There was no correlation between PGP expression and sex, age, marrow blast percentage or extramedullary disease. On the contrary, strict correlations were noted either between C219 negativity and FAB M3 subtype or between C219 positivity and FAB M5 group (P = 0.003). Significant correlation was found between PGP phenotype and CD7, as 143 of 223 samples had similar patterns of staining with C219 (P < 0.0001). Finally, there was a close relationship between C219 and JSB1 positivity: all the C219+ cases were positive for JSB1 (P < 0.0001). Concerning the karyotype, most patients with monosomy or del (7) were MDR positive; on the other hand, most patients with t(8;21) or t(15;17) were MDR negative. Rh123 accumulation studies showed a significant decrease of mean fluorescence intensities both in C219 and in JSB1 positive cases in comparison with PGP negative ones (P < 0.001). A significant decrease of remission induction rates (CR) was highlighted both between C219+ and C219- and between JSB1+ and JSB1- cases (32.1% v 62.1% and 32.6% v 73.8%, respectively, with P < 0.0001). The overall survival and the remission duration (CCR) were significantly shorter both in C219+ and in JSB1+ patients with no relationship to age. Furthermore, a higher rate of early relapses was noted among MDR+ when compared with MDR- patients both for C219+ and JSB1+ cases. The combination (C219- JSB1+) identified a subset of patients with an intermediate prognosis. On multivariate analysis, C219 and JSB1 were confirmed to be independent prognostic factors for achievement of CR, overall survival and CCR. In conclusion, the assessment of MDR phenotype by flow cytometry is a crucial prognostic factor of treatment outcome in AML.","[""Cattedra e Divisione Ematologia, Universita' Tor Vergata, Roma, Italy.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition they frequently have unusual T-cell populations in the peripheral blood including an increase in the number of activated T-cells and an inverted CD4:CD8 ratio. More recently several reports have documented the presence of large, monoclonal populations of T-cells in patients with paraproteinaemia, B-CLL and hairy cell leukemia. Such cells can reach very high levels in the peripheral blood, occasionally representing over 50% of all CD8+ T-cells. These clonally expanded cells have a characteristic morphology and phenotype in that they are often large, granular cells with natural killer cells markers. Their properties have not been studied in detail but they appear to suppress immunoglobulin production and kill cell targets in an MHC-unrestricted manner. The relationship of clonal T-cells to the B-cell tumour is unclear. They may be directly interacting with the malignant clone or alternatively be nonspecifically activated secondary to a disruption of the immune homeostasis by tumour cells. If they indeed represent an attempt by the immune response to control the malignant cells it is possible that they may be utilised in future attempts at immunotherapy.","['Department of Haematology and Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, U.K.']",,,31,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such studies should be interpreted with caution because they were typically carried out in the presence of serum which not only contains significant amounts of FGFs, but other cytokines as well. The development of greatly improved techniques for isolating purified populations of primitive hematopoietic cells, for culturing such cells in serum free conditions, and for analyzing the molecular consequences of exposing these cells to FGF cytokines allow the conclusions of these earlier studies to be tested more rigorously. Our investigations, and those of others, suggest that FGFs may not play an important direct role in regulating the development of human hematopoietic stem cells.

The function of WT1, which is a zinc finger protein and has domains characteristic of transcription factors, is not well understood. The level of expression is highest in leukaemias with immature phenotypes. Expression of WT1 is downregulated during differentiation of leukaemic cell lines and high levels of WT1 expression can cause cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. This may reflect a role in the control of normal haematopoiesis, which can be abrogated by mutations in the gene and form part of the pathway towards leukaemogenesis.","['Section of Paediatrics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",,,103,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxic potency of MEN 10710 was increased from 10- to 100-fold, as compared to tallimustine or L-PAM in murine L1210, human LoVo and MCF7 tumor cell lines. MEN 10710 was still active against L1210/L-PAM leukemic cells, while a partial cross-resistance was observed in LoVo/DX and in MCF7/DX cells selected for resistance to doxorubicin and expressing a MDR phenotype. Treatment with verapamil (VRP) reduced the resistance to tallimustine, but not to MEN 10710, in MCF7/DX cells. The cytotoxic effects reflect in vivo antitumor potency and toxicity in the treatment of human tumor xenografts. MEN 10710 was more effective in A2780/DDP, an ovarian carcinoma selected for resistance to cisplatin. On the other hand, the IC30 for inhibiting murine granulocyte/macrophage colony formation was 50 times higher for MEN 10710 than for tallimustine, suggesting a lower myelotoxic potential.

Thus, immune dysfunction and increased oxidation induced by murine retrovirus infection were largely prevented by DHEA.","['Arizona Prevention Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724, USA.']",,['R25-RR10163/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its pharmacokinetics were studied in mice. The drug was administered intravenously and orally to ICR mice to assess its pharmacokinetic parameters in plasma and whole blood. The lipophilic drug was administered in small unilamellar liposomes 100-400 nm in diameter. The concentrations of NOAC in plasma and erythrocytes were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). When given orally a rather low amount of the delivered NOAC was absorbed as the unchanged drug, resulting in a bioavailability of 1.1% from the plasma and 12.9% from whole blood. As shown elsewhere, the amount of drug absorbed is sufficient to provide excellent cytotoxic activity in the L1210 leukemia and in human xenograft models after oral administration. The mean residence time of NOAC after intravenous administration was 3.5 h in plasma and 6 h in whole blood giving NOAC a terminal half-life in blood substantially longer than that of cytosine arabinoside. After oral administration the mean residence time was 18 h in plasma and whole blood. In summary, NOAC has a prolonged half-life after intravenous administration compared with cytosine arabinoside. The distribution of NOAC in blood is highly dependent on its mode of administration.","['Institute of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A functional study of cell surface A2b adenosine receptors was performed on the T cell leukaemia line, Jurkat. 2. A2b receptors were coupled both to the adenylate cyclase system and to intracellular calcium channels. In fact, the agonist of A2b receptors, 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), led to a transient accumulation of intracellular calcium by an inositol phosphate-independent mechanism. 3. The NECA-induced accumulation of cGMP was not responsible for the calcium mobilization via A2b receptors. 4. The calcium response elicited by activation of A2b receptors was independent of that evoked by activation of the T cell receptor. 5. These findings not only delineate a novel transduction mechanism for adenosine but also support a specific role for adenosine in modulating signals elicited via the T cell receptor.","['Departament de Bioquimica i Biologia Molecular, Facultat de Quimica, Universitat de Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.']",,,,,PMC1565051,,,,,,,,,,

Current classification often does not clearly separate these entities since they share many features, both clinically and hematologically. We report here a case that satisfies criteria for both chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, appearing to fluctuate between the two. This lends further evidence for the heterogeneity of these disorders and the need for better definition. An improved classification scheme would allow for more accurate reporting and research into etiology and treatment. The complex cytogenetic abnormalities of the case are unique and to our knowledge have not been reported previously. Also, this case report underscores the importance of cytochemical stains when such disorders are under consideration.","['Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts, Hospital Laboratories and Medical Center, Worcester 01655, USA.']",,,25,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic study of these cases usually requires mitogenic stimulation and can often be hindered by a lack of response of the tumour cells to mitogen, poor quality metaphases, complex markers and proliferation of normal cells. In situ hybridisation with fluorescence-labelled chromosome-specific centromeric DNA probe, single or low copy sequences and whole chromosome paints which hybridise to complementary sequences allow the detection of numerical and structural abnormalities on metaphase and interphase cells with much greater efficiency. Comparative genomic hybridisation uses whole genomic tumour DNA as probe which is hybridised to normal metaphases. It is particularly useful for detecting chromosomal changes without being dependent on the dividing tumour cells.

METHOD: Children aged 2 to 5 years with cancer diagnoses and their parents and families (n = 38) were assessed immediately after diagnosis, 1 year after diagnosis, and 2 years after diagnosis. At each assessment, the psychological adjustment of the children and their families was compared with the adjustment of a cohort of children and families in the general community (n = 39). RESULTS: Children with cancer and their parents experienced significantly more emotional distress than children and parents in the community during the period immediately after diagnosis. However, the number of problems experienced by the children with cancer and their parents declined during the first year after the children's diagnosis and stabilized at a level comparable with that found among children and parents in the general community. CONCLUSION: Although the results are consistent with reports that suggest that in the longer term the prevalence of psychological problems among children with cancer is similar to that found among children in the general community, they also highlight the considerable distress experienced by children and parents during the period immediately after the children's diagnosis.","['Department of Psychiatry, University of Adelaide, Australia. msawyer@medicine.adelaide.edu.au']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 83 newly diagnosed pediatric ALL patients with early pre-B cell phenotype treated at our hospital during the last 8 years, four patients were diagnosed as having hypercalcemia (> 14 mg/dl). In these 4 hypercalcemic ALL patients at onset, serum calcium levels ranged from 14.6 to 20.8 mg/dl (normal 7.4-9.0 mg/dl), and serum PTHrP levels were markedly elevated to 112-240 pmol/l (normal range: 17.6-61.2 pmol/l). Unlike patients with ordinary ALL in childhood, gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) and skeletal symptoms (bone pain, gait disturbance) were the chief complaints. Because of these characteristic symptoms, bone marrow aspiration was carried out in two patients in an attempt to diagnose ALL before leukemic cells appeared in peripheral blood. Serum calcium levels were promptly normalized by induction chemotherapy. The four patients have been in complete remission from 35+ to 125+ months.

We examined the ability of mizoribine, an IMP dehydrogenase inhibitor, to induce differentiation in HL-60 and U937 cells as well as in fresh leukemic blast cells from patients with non-lymphocytic leukemia. Treatment with mizoribine reduced intracellular GTP levels and induced morphologic and functional differentiation in these two cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. HL-60 and U937 cells developed polymorphic nuclei and macrophage-like cytoplasm, respectively, as well as expression of CD11b and CD14 antigens and the ability to oxidize NBT. These changes became evident when intracellular GTP levels decreased to approximately 30% of untreated controls and were abrogated by addition of guanosine to the media. However, in fresh leukemic cells, the cells showing maturation in response to mizoribine were limited in those derived from two of ten patients having non-lymphocytic leukemia. These findings suggest mizoribine could induce differentiation in HL-60 and U937 cells through a decrease of intracellular GTP levels. Further study is required to determine its clinical use in patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical School, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In ROIIC, drug dose is modified for each patient to achieve hematologic target points, based on the concept that this achievement, not a preset drug dose, increases the likelihood of attaining CR. However, the existing target points lack objectivity, therefore prohibiting worldwide use of ROIIC. In addition, the achievement of these target points does not statistically relate to CR, which contradicts the concept of ROIIC. To solve these problems, we evaluated various parameters of 117 AML cases treated by ROIIC to identify the factors relating to CR. Of 117 AML subjects, 75 achieved CR with ROIIC and most cases achieving CR did so with one ROIIC course. Not the administered dose of drugs but several hematologic parameters at the end of ROIIC correlated significantly with CR. A total of four parameters, all related to the leukemic cell mass, were independent predictive factors of CR. A formula consisting of these parameters predicted CR cases with high sensitivity (98%) and non-CR cases with high specificity (96%). Based on this formula, an objective target point (a bone marrow blast mass ratio between before and after ROIIC of below 0.15), valid for dose modification during ROIIC, was established. These results validate the concept of ROIIC and enable objective dose modification in ROIIC and universal application of this therapy. Further, the formula predicting non-CR cases at the end of ROIIC is useful for deciding early therapeutic intervention for such cases.","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter includes HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and HTLV-1 uveitis (HU) and other diseases with unestablished associations such as arthropathy, pneumopathy, dermatitis, exocrinopathy and myositis. ATL is defined as neoplastic clonal growth of HTLV-1-infected T-cells and is characterized by unique clinical features including hypercalcemia and severe organ infiltration of leukemic cells. HAM/TSP and HU are characterized by infiltration of HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes and dysregulated production of cytokines. Four major subtypes (genotypes) of HTLV-1 have been identified, which depend more on geography than disease. No disease-specific variants or mutations have been identified to date. A viral transcriptional regulator, Tax, regulates virus and cellular gene expression through binding to transcription factors or other cytoplasmic cellular molecules. Aberrant expression of cellular genes will affect fundamental cellular functions. The interaction between HTLV-1-infected cells and different kinds of cells in the host appears to be one of the basic mechanisms underlying the development of HTLV-1-associated diseases. This interaction may play a major role in determining tumorigenicity and in forming clinical features of the disease. Increased provirus load found in patients with HAM/TSP and HU results from clonal expansion of the HTLV-1-infected T-cells, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-associated diseases. Regulatory mechanisms of clonal growth remain unknown. Efforts to characterize functions of the viral proteins and the virus-infected cells and to understand the natural history of the HTLV-1-infection are required to determine the mechanisms of HTLV-1 viral pathogenesis.","['Department of Pathology, University of Tokyo, Japan. tnabe@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",,,204,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many purging agents used in autologous bone marrow transplantation protocols, including hyperthermia, preferentially kill cycling cells. A pretreatment with Goralatide offers a possibility to reduce the haemotoxicity in many purging settings. The impact of Goralatide on the hyperthermic purging protocol was investigated in normal and myeloid leukaemic (SA8) murine cells. The median survival time after transplantation (i.e. leukaemia incidences) was used as an in vivo parameter to determine the effects on leukaemic cells. The hyperthermic effect on normal and leukaemic cells was also investigated in vitro using the cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC) assay. A heat treatment of 90 min at 43 degrees C resulted in a 4-log depletion of leukaemic stem cells. For normal progenitor cells (CFU-GM) a 2-log cell kill was shown. The reduction in proliferative activity of the CFU-GM after an 8 h incubation with 10(-9) M Goralatide resulted in a decrease in the heat sensitivity of the progenitor subset to approximately a 1-log cell kill. The leukaemic precursor cells seem insensitive to Goralatide inhibition, implicating an increase in the therapeutic window of the hyperthermic purging protocol. Finally, simulated remission bone marrow (5% leukaemic blasts) was incubated with Goralatide followed by a heat treatment of 90 min at 43 degrees C. Lethally irradiated (10 Gy) mice transplanted with heat-treated remission bone marrow (10(6) normal bone marrow cells versus 5 x 10(4) leukaemic cells) died of aplasia while Goralatide-pretreated remission bone marrow could rescue the irradiated mice without revealing leukaemic engraftment. These findings confirmed the enhanced protection against hyperthermia of the normal haemopoietic subsets by Goralatide and thus increased the success of the hyperthermic purging protocol.","['Department of Radiobiology, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were harvested using standard aphereses from day 5 of G-CSF Patients underwent one to four (median three) aphereses.

This can be accomplished by conventional cytogenetic methods, fluorescence in situ hybridization or RT-PCR. Such techniques are time consuming and not universally available. The intracellular distribution of the PML protein in promyelocytes is characteristically altered in APL and this can be detected by immunocytochemistry.

Only 53% of the patients had been fully banded by standard methods. With CGH, 36 patients retained a normal chromosomal profile and 36 had unbalanced abnormalities. No amplification was detected. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with centromeric and unique sequence probes was used in those cases with discrepancies or unsuccessful karyotype to validate CGH results.

These represented patients randomized in previous trials, between 1986 and 1994, which compared empirical antibiotic regimens for fever in neutropenic patients. There were fewer childhood acute myeloid leukaemia patients than adults but more acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases and more with solid tumours undergoing intensive myelosuppressive therapy. The children were less likely to be undergoing first induction therapy but the relative incidence of patients receiving relapse schedules or maintenance therapies were not significantly different in the two age groups. Children less frequently had a defined site of infection than adults and where they had a defined site there were more upper respiratory tract but fewer lung infections. There was a similar low incidence of shock at presentation in the two groups but the children's median neutrophil count was lower, and their median duration of granulocytopenia before the trial was shorter. The incidence of bacteraemia was similar, but clinically documented infection was less frequent and fever of unknown origin consequently more common in children. Children developed more streptococcal bacteraemias and fewer staphylococcal bacteraemias than adults (P=0.003) but the relative incidence of various gram-negative species was similar (P=0.57). In general, the children had a better overall success rate and lower mortality than adults. Death from infection was only 1% in children versus 4% in adults (P=0.001), and time to defervescence was shorter in children. In the younger age group, univariate logistic regression models showed high temperature, prolonged neutropenia before the trial and shock as prognostic indicators for the presence of bacteraemia. Solid tumour patients were significantly less likely to have a bacteraemia. Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent prognostic value of these indicators. Using the logistic equation of the selected model, the overall discriminant ability was poor. However, it was possible to identify a small subgroup without shock or high fever and with a short prior duration of neutropenia which carries a particularly low risk of bacteraemia, who could be considered for early discharge, monotherapy and shortened courses of antibodies, in prospective trials.","['Haematology Department, Great Ormond Street Childrens Hospital, London, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Megakaryocyte gene expression of MELC was also compared to that of other haemopoietic cell populations from normal mice and mice infected with the anaemic strain of the Friend virus.

In this study, retroviral insertional mutagenesis was employed to identify oncogenes that cooperate with the E2A-PBX1 transgene in lymphomagenesis. Neonatal retroviral infection substantially reduced length of survival due to accelerated development of lymphomas (81 versus 130 days). The Pim1 gene was targeted by retroviral insertions in 48% of accelerated lymphomas whereas less than 5% contained activated c-Myc and none contained activated Pim2. However, Pim1 DNA rearrangements were frequently sub-stoichiometric and not present at all sites of involvement in an otherwise monoclonal lymphoma indicating that Pim1 activation occurred late in the course of lymphomagenesis. Tumor subpopulations containing activated Pim1 alleles displayed a substantial growth advantage over Pim1 negative cells following serial transfer to secondary, syngeneic recipients. Cooperative interactions were observed in intercrossed Pim1 and E2A-PBX1 transgenic mice in which all double transgenic progeny developed lethal, diffuse T lineage lymphomas by 3 months of age, whereas only 13% of E2A-PBX1 and none of Pim1 single transgenic intercross progeny developed lymphomas by 1 year. Tumors from double transgenic mice were monoclonal providing evidence that additional genetic events were required for transformation. Therefore, Pim1 and E2a-Pbx1 cooperate in T lineage lymphomagenesis but they are not sufficient and the role of Pim1 is more likely to be associated with tumor progression.","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305, USA.']",,['CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although comprehensive understanding of specific mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of either disease has not yet been achieved, the viral regulatory protein Tax is believed to play a significant role. Previous studies demonstrated the potential of Tax to transform host cells. Here, it is shown that the Tax transactivator has in addition the potential to induce T cell death by apoptosis. Using an inducible system (Jurkat cell line JPX-9), significant apoptotic cell death upon Tax expression was observed. In an attempt to detect the cellular genes mediating this effect, it was found that induction of Tax was associated with marked upregulation of the Fas ligand (FasL) gene. Tax-induced apoptosis was inhibited when the Fas/FasL pathway was interrupted by YVAD-cmk, the inhibitor of ICE-like proteases. Transient expression experiments provided additional support for the putative role of endogenous FasL in Tax-induced apoptosis. Upon cotransfection with Tax-expressing plasmid, the transcriptional activity of the FasL promoter was found to be significantly upregulated in Jurkat cells and several other cell lines, as measured by reporter gene expression. Furthermore, cotransfection using different Tax mutants demonstrated that both CREB and NF-kappaB activation domains of Tax protein were required for the transactivation to take effect.","['Department of Virus and Cancer, Danish Cancer Society, Aarhus C, Denmark.']",,,,['GENBANK/AF027385'],,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, some aspects of macrophage response to particle exposure might conceivably result from alterations in glycosylation. Therefore, the effect of mineral particles on protein glycosylation was investigated in phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-differentiated U-937. Jacalin, a lectin specific for O-glycosylated structures, showed a global increase in O-glycosylation in particle-treated cells. In contrast, no significant modifications were observed with concanavalin A, a lectin that recognizes certain N-glycosylated structures. The sialic acid-specific lectins Sambucus nigra agglutinin and Maackia amurensis agglutinin and the galactose-specific lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin revealed a complex pattern of alterations in glycoprotein glycosylation after crystalline silica or manganese dioxide treatments. Expression of sialyl Lewis(x), a glycosylated structure implicated in leukocyte trafficking, could not be detected in control or treated cells. This finding was consistent with the decrease in sialyl Lewis(x) expression observed during PMA-induced differentiation. In conclusion, various treatments used in this study induced quantitative as well as qualitative changes in protein glycosylation. Whether these changes are due to glycosidase release or to an alteration in glycosyltransferase expression remains to be determined. The potential functional implications of these changes are currently under investigation.","['INSERM, U139, IM3, Faculte de Medecine 8, Creteil, France.']",,,,,PMC1470180,,,,,,,,,,

Both resistant long-term nonprogressor (B10.BR) and progressor (BALB.K) mice generate an early immune response that results in a dramatic decrease in the number of virus-infected cells. Despite this early immune response, mice from both strains become persistently infected. However, resistant B10.BR mice also demonstrate a late T-cell-mediated response that may be causally related to long-term nonprogression whereas susceptible BALB.K mice fail to demonstrate this late T-cell response. In the present studies, the T-cell subsets involved in the effective early immune response in both B10.BR and BALB.K mice as well as the late T-cell response in B10.BR mice were determined by in vivo antibody-mediated depletion. Results from these studies demonstrate that during the early acute phase of infection, elimination of CD4+ T cells ablated the ability of both BALB.K and B10.BR mice to decrease the burden of virus-infected cells. However, elimination of CD8+ T cells ablated this result in BALB.K but not B10.BR mice. Thus, despite the fact that both immunocompetent B10.BR and BALB.K mice are able to decrease the number of virus-infected cells during the early acute phase of infection, there is a difference in the T-cell subsets that mediate this effect in these strains of mice. In addition, characterization of the late immune response that keeps virus at very low levels during the persistent stage of virus infection in resistant B10.BR mice demonstrated that simultaneous elimination of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells allowed the emergence of virus-infected cells whereas the elimination of either subset alone showed no effect compared to untreated control mice that are immunologically intact. Since B10.BR and BALB.K are identical with respect to their H-2k-haplotypes, it appears that the differences between these strains with respect to the generation of effective early and late anti-virus immune responses are regulated by a non-H-2-linked gene(s).","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Allegheney University of the Health Sciences, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the spectrum of histologies, chromosomal abnormalities and clinical outcome in patients with teratoma with malignant transformation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 46 patients with germ cell tumor meeting morphologic criteria for malignant transformation. Histology, disease extent and treatment were correlated with survival. Tumors in 12 patients were studied by conventional cytogenetics or molecular genetic techniques for the isochromosome 12p [i(12p)], a marker for germ cell tumor, as well as other chromosomal abnormalities. RESULTS: The site of first detection of malignant transformation occurred in the primary tumor of 21 cases (44%), at a metastatic site in 20 (43%) and in both sites in 5 (10%). Sarcoma was the most frequent histology, identified in 29 patients (63%) with rhabdomyosarcoma the most common subtype. Seventeen tumors (37%) contained a solid tumor histology other than sarcoma, with adenocarcinoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor as the most common histologies. Four patients with mediastinal germ cell tumor containing sarcoma also had hematological malignancies, including a focus of nonHodgkin's lymphoma in the mediastinal primary tumor (1) and nonlymphocytic leukemia in spleen or bone marrow (3). Patients who had teratoma with malignant transformation components confined to the testis or retroperitoneum completely resected experienced a longer survival than those with distant metastases or incompletely resected tumors (p = 0.003). Chromosomal abnormalities associated with germ cell tumor (i[12p]) were identified in 11 of 12 tumors containing adenocarcinoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, sarcoma and leukemia. In addition to i (12p), chromosomal rearrangements characteristic of the transformed histology were detected in 4 tumors. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of nongerm cell histologies, including sarcoma, adenocarcinoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor and leukemia, may occur in association with germ cell tumor. Chromosomal abnormalities in these tumors include i (12p), reflecting germ cell tumor clonality, as well as chromosomal abnormalities associated with the transformed histology.

No constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation was detected on any STAT in CLL cells. To assess the phosphorylation of serine residues of STAT1 and STAT3 in CLL cells, we raised antibodies that specifically recognize the form of STAT1 phosphorylated on ser-727 and the form of STAT3 phosphorylated on ser-727. We found that in 100% of patients with CLL (n = 32), STAT1 and STAT3 were constitutively phosphorylated on serine. This was in contrast to normal peripheral blood B lymphocytes or CD5+) B cells isolated from tonsils, in which this phosphorylation was absent. Serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was seen occasionally in other leukemias, but it was a universal finding only in CLL. The serine phosphorylation of these STATs was a continuous process, as incubation of CLL cells with the kinase inhibitor H7 led to the dephosphorylation of these serine residues. The STAT serine kinase in CLL cells has not been identified, and appears to be neither mitogen-activated protein kinase nor pp70(s6k). In summary, the constitutive serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 is present in all CLL samples tested to date, although the physiologic significance of this modification remains to be determined.","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. david_frank@dfci.harvard.edu']",,"['CA-41619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-66966/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC508527,,,,,,,,,,

At least five complementation groups (FA-A-FA-E) have been identified. The relative prevalence of FA-A has been estimated at an average of approximately 65% but may widely vary according to ethnic background. In Italy, 11 of 12 patients analyzed by cell-fusion studies were assigned to group FA-A, suggesting an unusually high relative prevalence of this FA subtype in patients of Italian ancestry. We have screened the 43 exons of the FAA gene and their flanking intronic sequences in 38 Italian FA patients, using RNA-SSCP. Ten different mutations were detected: three nonsense and one missense substitutions, four putative splice mutations, an insertion, and a duplication. Most of the mutations are expected to cause a premature termination of the FAA protein at various sites throughout the molecule. Four protein variants were also found, three of which were polymorphisms. The missense mutation D1359Y, not found in chromosomes from healthy unrelated individuals, was responsible for a local alteration of hydrophobicity in the FAA protein, and it was likely to be pathogenic. Thus, the mutations so far encountered in the FAA gene are essentially all different. Since screening based on the analysis of single exons by genomic DNA amplification apparently detects only a minority of the mutations, methods designed to detect alterations in the genomic structure of the gene or in the FAA polypeptide may be helpful in the identification of FAA mutations.","['Servizio di Genetica Medica, IRCCS-Ospedale CSS, Foggia, Italy.']",,['E.0364/Telethon/Italy'],,,PMC1716093,,,,,,,,,,

A cohort of the 394 relatives of the 125 probands contributed 7,939 person-years of observation. Among the relatives as a whole, we found a statistically significant increased risk of developing all malignancies except non-melanoma skin carcinoma (21 observed relatives with cancer and 12.46 expected, for a standardized incidence ratio [SIR] of 1.69), of developing breast cancer (SIR = 3.09) and of developing haemolymphatic system neoplasms (SIR = 4.03). This was mainly due to the excess cancer risk in the relatives of probands with intracranial tumours, who showed a significant 3.1-fold risk for developing all cancers but non-melanoma skin tumours. Our findings and the previously reported steep rise in the incidence of childhood brain tumours in our area may imply that not only genetic factors but also shared environmental agents might be involved in the observed aggregation of cancer in the families of probands with intracranial tumours.","['Cancer Registry of the Province of Trieste, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the deletion and methylation status of MTS1 and MTS2 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of both T-cell (17 cases) and B-cell phenotypes (29 cases), and p16INK4A and p15INK4B mRNA expression in 36 of these cases. Biallelic or monoallelic loss of both MTS1 and MTS2 was observed in 12 cases of B-ALL and nine cases of T-ALL. Two cases of T-ALL showed deletion of MTS1 but not MTS2. The 5' CpG region of MTS2 was hypermethylated in 12 cases of precursor B-ALL and eight cases of T-ALL but no hypermethylation was found in the 5' CpG region of MTS1. All cases with homozygous deletion of MTS1 or MTS2 had no or low levels of mRNA expression and similar low levels of expression were found in cases in which MTS2 was present but fully methylated. Thus hypermethylation of MTS2, in contrast to MTS1, is frequent in childhood ALL. Furthermore our data show that although inactivation of MTS1 by deletion is common, inactivation of MTS2 by a combination of deletion and hypermethylation is more frequent in both B-ALL (20/29, 69%) and T-ALL (17/17, 100%). This suggests that both MTS1 and MTS2 are important targets of the 9p21-22 deletion.","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INTERVENTIONS: We compared uptake and polyglutamation of [3H]-MTX by freshly isolated leukemic blasts in vitro after 24-hour exposure to 1, 10, and 50 microM [3H]-MTX. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean MTX uptake (pmol/10(6) cells) was 0.78 +/- 0.19, 2.3 +/- 0.54, and 5.9 +/- 1.9, respectively, and mean polyglutamation was 82%, 66%, and 46%. Consequently, mean MTX polyglutamates were 0.68 +/- 0.18, 1.5 +/- 0.47, and 2.2 +/- 0.67 pmol/10(6) cells. Three of 15 patient samples had no detectable polyglutamation of MTX at 50 microM but MTX polyglutamates were detectable at 1 microM. Two of these three had a decrease in MTX polyglutamates at 10 versus 1 microM. In eight precursor B cell samples there was a significant difference in median MTX polyglutamates at 1 versus 10 microM but not 10 versus 50 microM. CONCLUSION: Increasing extracellular MTX concentrations may be counterproductive for some patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. If MTX polyglutamates are important for efficacy, optimal delivery of MTX may have to be determined by individual metabolism rather than by targeting a specific drug concentration.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9063, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A compilation of previously published hematologic malignancies with translocations involving the long arms of chromosomes 1 and 5 revealed a total of 23 cases--11 with unbalanced and 12 with balanced t(1;5)--with the following morphologies: 11 AML, three MDS, two Philadelphia-positive chronic myeloid leukemias, three chronic myeloproliferative disorders, three acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and one chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Four patients had received chemotherapy including alkylating agents for a previous malignancy and one had been exposed to thorotrast. Among the 14 patients for whom survival data exist, all except three have died. The t(1;5) was found as the sole abnormality in six cases, whereas it was apparently secondary--occurring in a subclone or together with the well-known primary abnormalities t(8;21), t(9;22), and t(15;17)--in nine cases. The breakpoints in 1q varied from 1q11 to 1q43, with a clustering to 1q21-23, and the 5q breaks occurred in 5q11 to 5q35, mainly in the distal 5q3 region.

A feature shared by some family members, and by other proteins that function in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation, is the presence of a 130- to 140-amino acid motif dubbed the SET or Tromo domain. Here we present analysis of SET1, a yeast member of the trithorax gene family that was identified by sequence inspection to encode a 1080-amino acid protein with a C-terminal SET domain. In addition to its SET domain, which is 40-50% identical to those previously characterized, SET1 also shares dispersed but significant similarity to Drosophila and human trithorax homologues. To understand SET1 function(s), we created a null mutant. Mutant strains, although viable, are defective in transcriptional silencing of the silent mating-type loci and telomeres. The telomeric silencing defect is rescued not only by full-length episomal SET1 but also by the conserved SET domain of SET1. set1 mutant strains display other phenotypes including morphological abnormalities, stationary phase defects, and growth and sporulation defects. Candidate genes that may interact with SET1 include those with functions in transcription, growth, and cell cycle control. These data suggest that yeast SET1, like its SET domain counterparts in other organisms, functions in diverse biological processes including transcription and chromatin structure.","['Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado 80309-0347, USA.']",,,,,PMC25717,,,,,,,,,,

The increase in spi-1 expression ranged from 4- to 8-fold with the different interferons. K562 cells can be differentiated in vitro towards erythroid cells or monocyte-macrophage cells. Interestingly, the regulation of spi-1 by interferon-alpha depended on the differentiated phenotype of K562 cells: interferon-alpha failed to induce spi-1 in erythroid differentiated cells, whereas it induced spi-1 in monocyte-macrophage differentiated cells.

To elucidate if PML may play a role in cellular response to DNA damage, PML expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining in HeLa cells treated with ionizing radiation (IR) and cisplatin. Our studies demonstrated IR at 20Gy, and cisplatin at 6 micrograms/ml caused more than 5-10 fold increases in PML protein expression in the PML Oncogenic Domain (POD) by immunofluorescent staining. Northern blotting showed that there was no gross increase in mRNA levels indicating that the induction is a post-transcriptional event. Flow cytometry showed that HeLa cells treated with IR were progressively arrested in G1, which correlates with the optimal expression of PML in the cell cycle. To determine if PML expression was under the control of the tumor suppressor p53, which is known to arrest cells in G1, HeLa cells were transfected with the wild-type p53 gene. PML expression in p53 transduced cells were 5-10 fold higher than the control, indicating that the enhanced expression of PML is apparently dependent on the p53 pathway. These data also indicate that PML may play an important role in cellular response to DNA damage such as DNA repair or apoptosis during G1 arrest.","['Department of Clinical Oncology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sir Y.

In addition, analysis of binding data using tritiated 17 beta E2 as ligand at high concentrations (10-40 nM) and either unlabeled 17 beta E2 or raloxifene as competitors gave similar results demonstrating the presence of type II EBS in these cells. Picomolar concentrations of raloxifene significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited cell proliferation. Moreover, the compound at nanomolar concentrations induced a significant dose- and time-dependent increase of progesterone receptor, and activated apoptotic cell death.

All three cell lines expressed surface GPIIb-IIIa as measured by flow cytometry and by binding of 125I-anti-GPIIb-IIIa monoclonal antibody. Preincubation of cells with human AB serum or platelet releasate increased GPIIb-IIIa surface expression. GPIIb transcripts were identified in all three cell lines by Northern blot analysis. Furthermore, we readily detected GPIIb transcripts in fluorescence activated cell sorted (FACS) myeloid cells from normal human bone marrow by RT-PCR. Cloning and sequencing of the PCR products established the identity of GPIIb transcripts in the leukemic cell lines and CD34+/CD33+ normal bone marrow cells.

RI58 cDNA encodes a protein of 58kDa which has a similarity in its amino acids sequence to interferon (IFN)-inducible proteins. In addition, RI58 was induced by recombinant human IFN-alpha (rhIFN-alpha) in NB4 cells. RI58 was detectable within 4 hours post-stimulation with rhIFN-alpha, while it took as long as 1day after retinoic acid stimulation. Culture supernatant from retinoic acid-treated NB4 cells also induced RI58 expression similarly as rhIFN-alpha. This activity in culture supernatant was inhibited by anti-leukocyte IFN antiserum which showed specific reactivity to rhIFN-alpha.

HBV encodes a protein, pX, which abducts the cellular transcriptional machinery in several ways including direct interactions with bZIP transcription factors. These interactions increase the DNA affinities of target bZIP proteins in a DNA sequence-dependent manner. Here we use a series of bZIP peptide models to explore the mechanism by which pX interacts with bZIP proteins. Our results suggest that pX increases bZIP.DNA stability by increasing the stability of the bZIP dimer as well as the affinity of the dimer for DNA. Additional experiments provide evidence for a mechanism in which pX recognizes the composite structure of the peptide.DNA complex, not simply the primary peptide sequence. These experiments provide a framework for understanding how pX alters the patterns of transcription within the nucleus. The similarities between the mechanism proposed for pX and the mechanism previously proposed for the human T-cell leukemia virus protein Tax are discussed.","['Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520-8107, USA.']",,"['1-F32-GM17858-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 53829/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intracellular Ca2+ level was increased by treatment with UA. Intracellular Ca2+ inhibitors, such as intracellular Ca2+-release blockers (dantrolene, TMB-8 and ruthenium red) and an intracellular Ca2+ chelator (BAPTA/AM), significantly blocked the UA-induced increased intracellular Ca+ concentration.

We previously reported the production of HGF/SF from various human leukemia cell lines and a high level of the growth factor in blood and bone marrow plasma from patients with various types of leukemia. We determined here the effects of hematopoietic cytokines on HGF/SF production in human leukemia cell lines, KG-1, a myeloid cell line, and RPMI-8226, a B cell line. Interferon (IFN)-gamma remarkably stimulated HGF/SF production in both cell lines at concentrations of more than 0.1 or 1 IU/ml. IFN-alpha and IFN-beta were as effective as IFN-gamma in RPMI-8226 cells, but less than IFN-gamma in KG-1 cells. HGF/SF gene expression in KG-1 cells was also up-regulated by IFN-gamma. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-6 had no effect on HGF/SF production in the 2 leukemia cell lines. We also determined the effects of HGF/SF inducers known for human fibroblasts on the growth factor production in leukemia cells. Out of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), cholera toxin, IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, the former three were as effective as IFN-gamma in KG-1 cells, but only TNF-alpha stimulated HGF/SF production in RPMI-8226 cells, whose effect was less than those of IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-gamma. The effect of IFN-gamma in KG-1 cells was synergistic with that of PMA. In contrast with the effect in leukemia cells, HGF/SF induction by IFN-gamma in human skin fibroblasts was much less than that by PMA or cholera toxin. These results indicated that IFN-gamma is a potent inducer of HGF/SF in human leukemia cells. This finding suggests the presence of a homeostatic control mechanism in liver regeneration and repair: hepatic injury, DNA synthesis inhibition, or apoptosis caused by IFN-gamma is subsequently overcome by cytokine-induced HGF/SF, a potent promoter of liver DNA synthesis.","['Department of Immunochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Japan. gohda@pheasant.pharm.okayama-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To isolate factors binding to U5RE, we screened a cDNA expression library by south-western blotting with a U5RE probe. Screening 2 x10(6) clones gave a positive clone with a 3.8 kb insert encoding a novel 671 residue polypeptide, named HTLV-I U5RE binding protein 1 (HUB1), with five zinc finger domains and a Kruppel-associated box like domain; HUB1 may be related to a repressor belonging to the Kruppel type zinc finger protein. A 4.0 kb mRNA for HUB1 is ubiquitously expressed among all human tissues tested. HUB1 recognizes the TCCACCCC sequence as a core motif and exerts a strong repressive effect on HTLV-I LTR-mediated expression. A new repressive domain, named HUB1 repressive (HUR) domain, was identified, rather than the Kruppel-associated box like domain. The N-terminal region upstream of HUR domain seemed to be also indispensable to the repression. Thus, we propose that HUB1 is a new type repressor and plays an important role in the HTLV-I U5-mediated repression.","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, 2-5-1 Mishima, Settsu, Osaka 566, Japan.']",,,,['GENBANK/D30612'],PMC147159,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60/Bcl-2 cells displayed a 5-fold increase in Bcl-2 protein compared with empty-vector counter-parts (HL-60/pCEP4) but comparable levels of Bax, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL. After exposure to an equimolar concentration of ara-C (10 microM for 6 hr), HL-60/Bcl-2 cells were significantly less susceptible to apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, and loss of clonogenicity than HL-60/pCEP4 cells. The protective effect of increased Bcl-2 expression was manifested by a failure of ara-C to induce activation/cleavage of the Yama protease (CPP32; caspase-3) and degradation of one of its substrates, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase to an 85-kDa cleavage product. When HL-60/Bcl-2 cells were preincubated with bryostatin 1 (10 nM; 24 hr) or coincubated with either staurosporine (50 nM; 6 hr) or UCN-01 (300 nM; 6 hr) after a 1-hr preincubation, exposures that exerted minimal effects alone, ara-C-induced apoptosis and DNA fragmentation were restored to levels equivalent to, or greater than, those observed in empty-vector controls. These events were accompanied by restoration of the ability of ara-C to induce CPP32 cleavage and activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation, and inhibition of colony formation. Western analysis of Bcl-2 protein obtained from overexpressing cells treated with bryostatin 1, staurosporine, or UCN-01 revealed the appearance of a slowly migrating species and a general broadening of the protein band, effects that were insensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Alterations in Bcl-2 protein mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were reversed by treatment of lysates with alkaline phosphatase or protein phosphatase 2A; actions of the latter were blocked by the specific phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. In vivo labeling studies of Bcl-2 protein demonstrated increased incorporation of [32PO4]orthophosphate in drug-treated cells. Last, phosphorylated Bcl-2 failed to display decreased binding to the proapoptotic protein Bax.

Although the biochemical properties of polyamine transport in mammalian cells have been extensively studied, attempts to isolate and characterize the actual protein(s) have met with limited success. As one approach, photoaffinity labelling of cell surface proteins using a polyamine-conjugated photoprobe may lead to the identification of polyamine-binding proteins (pbps) associated with the transport apparatus and/or other regulatory responses. In a previous study [Felschow, MacDiarmid, Bardos, Wu, Woster and Porter (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 28705-28711], we demonstrated that the photoprobes N4-ASA-spermidine and N1-ASA-norspermine [where the ASA (azidosalicylamidoethyl) group represents the photoreactive moiety] competed effectively with polyamines for transport and selectively labelled two major pbps at 118 and 50 kDa on the surface of murine and human leukaemia cells. In the present study, a new and more potent polyamine-conjugated photoprobe, N1-ASA-spermine, has been synthesized and used to develop a method based on detergent lysis for identifying putative cell-surface pbps on solid-tumour cell types. Transport kinetic assays showed that the new photoprobe competed with spermidine uptake with an apparent Ki of 1 microM, a value 20-50-fold lower than those of earlier probes. In L1210 cells, the new probe identified pbp50 and pbp118 thus reaffirming their identity as pbps. Two new bands were also detected. In A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells, N1-ASA-spermine identified pbps at 39, 62, 73 and 130 kDa, the latter believed to be a size variant of pbp118. The presence of pbp130/118 in two very different cell types suggests the generality of the protein among mammalian cell types as well as its importance for further study. The high affinity of the photoprobe for the polyamine-transport system strongly suggests that at least some of the identified pbps may be associated with that function.","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",,"['CA-01072/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1219001,,,,,,,,,,

Both soluble and transmembrane forms of the protein have been described and several LIF-R mRNAs have been reported previously. In order to determine the coding potential of LIF-R mRNAs we have isolated and characterized the mouse LIF-R gene. mRNA encoding soluble LIF-R (sLIF-R) is formed by inclusion of an exon in which polyadenylation signals are provided by a B2 repeat. This exon is located centrally within the LIF-R gene but is excluded from the transmembrane LIF-R mRNA by alternative splicing. The transmembrane receptor is encoded by 19 exons distributed over 38 kb. Two distinct 5' non-coding exons have been identified, indicating the existence of alternative promoters. One of these is G/C rich and possesses a consensus initiator sequence as well as potential Sp1 binding sites. Expression of exon 1 from this promoter occurs in a wide variety of tissues, whereas expression of the alternative 5' untranslated region (exon 1a) is normally restricted to liver, the principal source of sLIF-R. During pregnancy expression of exon 1a becomes detectable also in the uterus. Expression of exon 1a increases dramatically during gestation and is accompanied by a similar quantitative rise in expression of sLIF-R mRNA. These findings establish that expression of LIF-R is under complex transcriptional control and indicate that regulated expression of the soluble cytokine receptor isoform may be due principally to an increase in the activity of a dedicated promoter.","[""Centre for Genome Research, University of Edinburgh, King's Buildings, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, Scotland, U.K.""]",,,,"['GENBANK/AF014933', 'GENBANK/AF014934']",PMC1219000,,,,,,,,,,

Correlation experiments with a standard cell growth inhibition assay and a radiometric method for measurement of thymidylate (dTMP) synthesis ([5-3H]-2'-deoxyuridine tritium release assay) were performed. No significant differences were observed in the IC50 values for the four cell lines tested as determined by cell growth evaluation (cell number counts) and the ATP-TCA after a 72 h MTX exposure. After short-term (4 h) high-dose MTX exposure, no significant correlation between ATP-TCA and the classic [5-3H]-2'-deoxyuridine tritium release assay was observed in both CCRF-CEM/S and CCRF-CEM/P cells. CCRF-CEM/T and CCRF-CEM/E displayed, instead, complete resistance with both methods. When using conditions proposed for clinical application (long-term exposure, i.e. 144 h) the ATP-TCA permitted the identification of cell lines highly resistant to MTX (CCRF-CEM/F and CCRF-CEM/E), while intermediate MTX resistance due to altered polyglutamylation was not detectable. Detection of this kind of resistance was obtained, as expected, using a short-term exposure (4 h) to MTX followed by a long-term efflux (72 h) in drug-free medium. On the basis of these results, ATP-TCA appears to be a suitable method for the evaluation of cytotoxicity induced by MTX.","['Department of Clinical Pathophysiology, University of Florence, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HGFs given on days simultaneously with CT might sensitize the leukemic cells and enhance their susceptibility to CT. HGFs applied after CT might hasten hematopoietic recovery and reduce morbidity or mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We set out to evaluate the use of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; 5 microg/kg) in a prospective randomized study of factorial design (yes or no GM-CSF during CT, and yes or no GM-CSF after CT) in patients aged 15 to 60 years (mean, 42) with newly diagnosed AML. GM-CSF was applied as follows: during CT only (+/-, n = 64 assessable patients), GM-CSF during and following CT (+/+, n = 66), no GM-CSF (-/-, n = 63), or GM-CSF after CT only (-/+, n = 60). RESULTS: The complete response (CR) rate was 77%. At a median follow-up time of 42 months, probabilities of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 years were 38% and 37% in all patients. CR rates, OS, and DFS did not differ between the treatment groups (intention-to-treat analysis). Neutrophil recovery (1.0 x 10(9)/L) and monocyte recovery were significantly faster in patients who received GM-CSF after CT (26 days v 30 days; neutrophils, P < .001; monocytes, P < .005). Platelet regeneration, transfusion requirements, use of antibiotics, frequency of infections, and duration of hospitalization did not vary as a function of any of the therapeutic GM-CSF modalities. More frequent side effects (eg, fever and fluid retention) were noted in GM-CSF-treated patients predominantly related to the use of GM-CSF during CT. CONCLUSION: Priming of AML cells to the cytotoxic effects of CT by the use of GM-CSF during CT or accelerating myeloid recovery by the use of GM-CSF after CT does not significantly improve treatment outcome of young and middle-aged adults with newly diagnosed AML.","['Dutch-Belgian Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Group (HOVON) and Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research: Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands. lowenberg@haed.azr.nl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past few years, studies have revealed an association between the virus and disorders of organ systems including myelopathy, polymyositis, alveolitis, and Sjogren's syndrome. In addition, we have proposed that HTLV-I-associated proliferative changes in nonlymphocyte synovial cells are termed HTLV-I-associated arthropathy(HAAP). To clarify the pathologic association of HTLV-I with this arthropathy, we attempted to detect HTLV-I proviral DNA in synovial tissue. Proviral HTLV-I DNA was detected not only in peripheral blood mononuclear cells but also in fresh synovial tissue cells and lymphocyte-depleted cultured synovial cells. We also detected mRNA for HTLV-I tax/rex in cultured synovial cells by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, induction of chronic inflammatory arthropathy in mice transgenic for HTLV-I tax gene strongly suggested the pathogenic mechanism of HAAP. Histologic findings of affected joints in mice showed erosions of bones and pannus-like granulomtous change with infiltration of mononuclear cells. Thus, this novel mechanism might explain synovial proliferation caused by HTLV-I. Tax-expressing transgenic mouse lines also demonstrated that tax itself could serve as an oncogne in fibroblastic cells. Tumors occurred in 100% of the mice with reproducible time periods after wounding. We established cell lines, which expressed high levels of c-fos, c-myc, myb, PDGF, TGF-beta, Zif, and IL-6. Antisense ablation of the p65 subunits of NF-kappa B profoundly inhibited tumor growth in vitro with no apparent affect on the growth of normal cells. These studies were successfully extended to tax-transgenic animals. Intraperitoneal injections of NF-kappa B p65 antisense at the 40 micrograms/g weight dose led to growth arrest after 7 days, and apparent involution after 20 days of treatment. We think activation of NF-kappa B by Tax is important for tumor progression. This paper supports the importance of analyzing molecular pathomechanisms.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kagoshima University of School of Medicine.']",,,23,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical diagnoses of 44 patients with monoclonal band(s) were all ATL. In contrast, the clinical diagnoses of 39 patients without monoclonal band(s) were diseases other than ATL. We also performed a long PCR of HTLV-1 to characterize the integrated provirus. The method allowed us to find a defective provirus, which was frequently observed in aggressive forms of ATL; 14 of the 18 patients with acute type(78%), 6 of the 9 patients with lymphoma type(67%), and 2 of the 12 patients with chronic type(17%) had the defective provirus. We established a simultaneous PCR for each region of HTLV-1 for further examination of the defective provirus. To detect the monoclonality of IgH gene rearrangement of B-cells, we performed PCR according to the method described.

Over a 12-year period, sixty-five patients with leukemia and fifteen patients with systemic lymphoma underwent cerebral CT and/or MR imaging. Nine patients (11.3%) were diagnosed as CNS involvement of leukemia and lymphoma. The diagnostic criteria of CNS involvement were as follows; 1) Histological proof was confirmed by surgery, 2) Tumor cells were found in the cerebrospinal fluid examinations, 3) Increase in size of the lesion during observation without specific treatment, and 4) Response to the treatment for leukemia or lymphoma. All of nine patients fulfilled more than two criteria of 1)-4). The CT and MR abnormalities in these patients were correlated with the findings of histology, cerebrospinal fluid cytology, and/or treatment. The age of the patients ranged from 0 to 15 years old. They consisted of 6 boys and 3 girls. The CT examinations were performed before and after contrast administration. MR examinations were performed on a 1.5-T unit, and T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density-weighted images were obtained using spin-echo or fast spin-echo sequences. Tumor masses were present in seven with leukemia (acute lymphoblastic leukemia 4; acute myeloblastic leukemia 1; acute promyelocytic leukemia 1; acute monocytic leukemia 1), and in two with malignant lymphoma. On the CT scan, tumor masses were hyperdense with contrast enhancement. On the MR images, their signals were variable. In all of nine patients, tumor masses were contiguous with a meningeal surface. Postcontrast T1 weighted images were valuable in demonstrating meningeal infiltration. Tumoral hemorrhage was found in two patients. In a patient with tumor at the superior sagittal sinus, venous infarct was observed. CNS leukemic and lymphomatous masses are almost hyperdense on the CT and they are characteristically contiguous with a meningeal surface. MR imaging was valuable in demonstrating meningeal infiltration. Findings of CT and MR imaging, cerebrospinal fluid examinations, and response to the treatment are useful in the differentiation of CNS involvement of leukemia and lymphoma from other lesions such as infectious diseases and leukoencephalopathy.","['Department of Radiology and Pediatrics, Akita University School of Medicine, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeting this potent immune reaction towards tumors by using IgE that reacts with a tumor-associated antigen, may induce a local inflammation at the tumor site, and may therefore promote tumor regression. We have previously shown that murine IgE bound to tumor cells can activate murine mast cells to release TNF-alpha and histamine. To further investigate the therapeutic potential of IgE-mediated immunotherapy of carcinomas, we have developed human/murine chimeric versions, containing the murine variable regions and human constant regions, of both G250 and 323/A3 IgE. These chimeric IgEs are reactive respectively with the G250 renal cell carcinoma antigen and the Ep-CAM molecule, which is highly expressed by most carcinomas. Transfection of the respective chimeric heavy and light chain genes into recipient Sp2/0 myeloma cells yielded chimeric IgE-producing clones. Chimeric G250 and 323/A3 IgE reacted with tumor cells expressing the G250 antigen or Ep-CAM, respectively. To generate a cell line that expresses Fc receptors for human or chimeric IgE, the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-7 was transfected with the human Fc epsilon RI alpha chain (RBL-7TZ) and subsequently tested for binding of chimeric IgE. Functional assays showed that both chimeric IgEs activated RBL-7TZ cells to release TNF-alpha when cultured with tumor cells that express the respective specific antigen. Furthermore, both chimeric IgEs were able to activate freshly isolated human basophils.","['Department of Pathology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The early phase of murine embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation, characterized by a gradual growth arrest, is accompanied with hsp27 transient accumulation. This differentiation process also correlated with changes in hsp27 phosphorylation and oligomerization. The role of hsp27 was investigated in ES clones stably transfected with murine or human hsp27 genes, placed in sense or antisense orientation. Several clones were obtained that either underexpressed endogenous murine hsp27 or overexpressed murine or human hsp27. Maintained undifferentiated, these clones showed similar growth rates. We report here that hsp27 constitutive overexpression enhanced the differentiation-mediated decreased rate of ES cell proliferation but did not alter morphological changes. In contrast, hsp27 underexpression, which attenuated cell growth arrest, induced differentiation abortion because of an overall cell death by apoptosis. Recently, we showed that hsp27 interfered with cell death probably because of its ability to modulate intracellular glutathione. hsp27 accumulation during ES cell differentiation was also correlated with an increase in glutathione, which was attenuated by hsp27 down-expression. Hence, hsp27 transient expression seems essential for preventing differentiating ES cells from undergoing apoptosis, a switch that may be redox regulated.","['Laboratoire du Stress Cellulaire, Centre de Genetique Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS UMR-5534, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon-I, 69622 Villeurbanne Cedex, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Camptothecin (CPT) and etoposide (VP-16) also markedly enhanced PKCalpha activity during apoptosis in HL60 cells. However, CPT did not affect PKCbetaI, betaII and zeta, and activated PKCdelta. PKCalpha activation was not due to increased protein levels or proteolytic cleavage but was associated with PKCalpha autophosphorylation in vitro and increased phosphorylation in vivo. We also found that not only PKC delta but also PKC betaI was proteolytically activated in HL60 cells during apoptosis. The PKCalpha activation and hyperphosphorylation were abrogated by N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(O-methyl)-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk) under conditions that abrogated apoptosis. z-VAD-fmk also prevented PKCdelta and betaI proteolytic activation. Together these findings suggest that caspases regulate PKC activity during apoptosis in HL60 cells. At least two modes of activation were observed: hyperphosphorylation for PKCalpha and proteolytic activation for PKC delta and betaI.","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Division of Basic Sciences, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All 6 HGV-infected patients were negative for the presence of the HGV RNA minus strand in the liver when tested with a strand-specific Tth-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and 5 were positive for the presence of the plus strand, albeit at low levels.

Here we demonstrate that the 74 kDa form is translated in rat basophilic leukemia cells, followed by conversion to the 53 kDa form, and that the 74 kDa form is a short half-life protein because of the degradation mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Degradation of the 74 kDa form was stimulated in the presence of an ATP-generating system, accompanied by ubiquitination, and inhibited by specific proteasome inhibitors such as ZL3H and lactacystin.

By use of polyclonal antibodies, the human p19ARF (hp19ARF) protein has been identified in the nucleus of various cells including normal cultured fibroblasts. The level of this protein did not fluctuate throughout the cell cycle and was more elevated in fibroblasts with limited or arrested growth, suggesting that p19ARF accumulated in presenescent or senescent cells. Interestingly, hp19ARF was not detected in several hemopoietic tumor cell lines (mainly of B-type lymphoid origin) that expressed abundant amounts of the p16beta transcript.

We have previously defined a minimally deleted region of 130 kb centromeric to the marker D13S272, and constructed a PAC and cosmid contig encompassing this area. In the present study we have made a detailed restriction and transcriptional map of the region of interest. Using these tools we have screened a panel of 206 primary CLL clones and three cell lines. In five CLL cases we found limited deletions defining the region of interest to an area of no more than 10 kb. Two adjacent genes, termed Leu1 and Leu2 (leukemia-associated gene 1 and 2), were mapped to the minimally deleted region, with several patients showing deletion borders within these genes. The Leu1 and Leu2 genes show little homology to previously published genes at the nucleotide and expected translated amino acid sequence level. Mutational analysis of the Leu1 and 2 genes in 170 CLL samples revealed no small intragenic mutations or point mutations. However, in all cases of 13q14 loss examined, the first exon of both genes, which are only 300 bp apart, were deleted.

Further, they have important functions in embryonic development. Hence, identification and characterization of members of this family are important. We identify a novel ETS family member, ELF3, and report its human and murine cDNA sequences. The mouse cDNA has an alternatively spliced transcript with an extra 60 bp inserted. Hence we present the organization of the murine Elf3 gene together with its exon/intron structure. This gene consists of 9 exons and 8 introns spanning 4.8 kb. ELF3 binds and transactivates ETS sequences and interestingly also shows the ability to bind a GGAT-like purine core, a preferential ETS1/ETS2 type binding site. The expression of ELF3, unlike most other ETS family members, is absent in hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic organs in humans and mice. Intriguingly, the gene is specifically expressed in cell lines of epithelial origin and in organs such as lung, stomach, intestine, kidney that have specialized epithelial cells. We localize the human gene to 1q32.2, a region that is amplified in epithelial tumors of the breast, lung and prostate.

To investigate possible consequences of wild-type p53 loss, we reconstituted CEM-C7H2, a subclone of CCRF-CEM, with a temperature-sensitive p53 allele (p53ts). Stably transfected lines expressed high levels of p53ts and shift to the permissive temperature (32 degrees C) caused rapid induction of p53-regulated genes, such as p21(CIP1/WAF1), mdm-2 and bax. This was followed by extensive apoptosis within 24 h to 36 h, supporting the notion that mutational p53 inactivation contributed to the malignant phenotype. p53-dependent apoptosis was preceded by digestion of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a typical target of interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE)-like proteases/caspases, and was markedly resistant to the ICE/caspase-1 and FLICE/caspase-8 inhibitor acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp.chloromethylketone (YVAD), but sensitive to the CPP32/caspase-3 inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp.fluoromethylketone (DEVD) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp.fluoromethylketone (zVAD), a caspase inhibitor with broader specificity. This indicated an essential involvement of caspases, but argued against a significant role of ICE/caspase-1 or FLICE/caspase-8. Actinomycin D or cycloheximide prevented cell death, suggesting that, in this system, p53-induced apoptosis depends upon macromolecule biosynthesis. Introduction of functional p53 into CEM cells enhanced their sensitivity to the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin, but not to the tubulin-active compound vincristine. Thus, mutational p53 inactivation in ALL might entail relative resistance to DNA-damaging, but not to tubulin-destabilizing, chemotherapy.","['Institute for General and Experimental Pathology, Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms responsible for this pattern of expression are poorly understood, but are likely to illuminate the molecular basis for stem cell development and lineage commitment. We have identified multiple lineage-restricted DNase I hypersensitive sites in a 45 kb region spanning the murine SCL locus. Committed erythroid cells and CD34 positive primitive myeloid cells exhibited both shared and unique DNase I hypersensitive sites whereas none were found in T cells. The function of each hypersensitive site was studied using both transient and stable reporter assays in erythroid, primitive myeloid and T cells.

The drug was administered using two different protocols, a 'high-dose' one involving 5 daily doses of 200 mg/kg, expected to cause depletion of the repair enzyme O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) and thus favour the selective accumulation of the premutagenic lesion O6-methylguanine (O6-meG) relative to other adducts, and a 'low-dose' one involving 10 daily doses of 20 mg/kg procarbazine. Substantial accumulation of O6-meG was observed in both tissues examined 6 h after the end of the 'high-dose' treatment, with the liver accumulating somewhat higher levels than the bone marrow (28.0 +/- 1.8 fmol/microg DNA and 18.5 +/- 1.1 fmol/microg DNA respectively). However, significant increases in mutant frequency 10 days after the end of treatment were observed only in the bone marrow, reaching a 16-fold increase over background following the 5 x 200 mg/kg treatment. Sequence analysis of the mutations induced after this treatment revealed a mixed spectrum, in which G:C-->A:T transitions (characteristic of O6-meG miscoding) were only a secondary feature: Among 20 mutants analysed, only six such mutations were found, including three at CpG sites, which might have arisen from deamination of 5-methylcytosine.

PML is a nuclear matrix-associated phosphoprotein whose expression is regulated during the cell cycle. Disruption of PML function by t(15;17) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) plays a critical role in leukemogenesis. To further study the role of PML in the control of cell growth, we have stably overexpressed PML protein in the HeLa cell line. This overexpression of PML significantly reduced the growth rate of HeLa cells and suppressed anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. We consequently investigated several parameters correlated with cell growth and cell cycle progression. We found that, in comparison with the parental HeLa cells, HeLa/PML stable clones showed proportionally more cells in G1 phase, fewer cells in S phase and about the same number in G2/M phase. The HeLa/PML clones showed a significantly longer doubling time as a result of a lengthening of the G1 phase. No effect on apoptosis was found in HeLa cells overexpressing PML. This observation indicates that PML suppresses cell growth by increasing cell cycle duration as a result of G1 elongation. To further understand the mechanism of the effect of PML on HeLa cells, expression of cell cycle-related proteins in HeLa/PML and parental HeLa cells was analyzed. We found that Rb phosphorylation was significantly reduced in PML stable clones. Expression of cyclin E, Cdk2 and p27 proteins was also significantly reduced. These studies indicate that PML affects cell cycle progression by mediating expression of several key proteins that normally control cell cycle progression. These results further extend our current understanding of PML function in human cells and its important role in cell cycle regulation.","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",,"['CA 55577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Updated data were obtained for 9 trials initiated by the CALGB between 1974 and 1992. The updated data were compared with the original published results. RESULTS: It was apparent from all the studies that hazard rates for death and relapse are greatest in the first year, decrease substantially between Years 1 and 2, then decrease further between Years 2 and 3. Rates of death and relapse are quite low after 3-4 years. Large numbers of patients are long-term disease free survivors. Overall, these patients have excellent function and a normal quality of life.

Extensive medical files are maintained at the ECOG Coordinating Center and are updated regularly. METHODS: Data on 1414 eligible patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), treated on 6 ECOG protocols during the period 1976-1994, were reviewed to determine the number of long-term survivors (LTS) and to identify factors that predicted LTS. Disease free survival and factors impacting quality of life were examined as well. RESULTS: Of the 1414 patients, 274 survived for > or = 3 years and were considered LTS. A logistic regression analysis revealed that factors predicting LTS included age < 55 years, female gender, treatment between 1985 and 1990, white blood cell count < 10,000 cells/mm3, and hemoglobin > 10 g/dL. Disease free survival improved with escalating intensity of therapy. Quality-of-life data showed that infections were fairly common. Significant graft-versus-host disease occurred in 6 of 40 patients who received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and contributed to the deaths of 4 individuals. Information on employment, insurance, social or marital difficulties, and psychosocial issues was more difficult to obtain. CONCLUSIONS: Prognosis in AML is a complex interaction involving the cellular origin of the malignant clone, morphology, and evolving therapeutic strategies. The most recent ECOG studies incorporate these variables and should provide additional insights into factors affecting LTS in patients with AML.","['Hematology/Medical Oncology Unit, University of Rochester Cancer Center, New York 14642, USA.']",,"['CA 11083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 22318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors therefore chose to review long-term follow-up data from 3 studies conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) between 1978 and 1990. METHODS: The analysis included data on 2083 patients enrolled in SWOG studies S7823, S8124, and S8600. The results were based on data available as of November 15, 1996. RESULTS: The probability of survival 8 years after entry was 9% in Study S7823, 14% in S8124, and 15% in S8600. For patients age < 50 years, the probabilities were 14%, 24%, and 20%, respectively. For patients ages 50-64 years, the probabilities were 7%, 8%, and 8%, respectively. For those age < 50 years who achieved complete remission, the 8-year probability of disease free survival was 17% in Study S7823, 28% in S8124, 17% with standard dose cytarabine in S8600, and 26% with high dose cytarabine in S8600. Relapse was the major reason for failure after complete remission in all three studies. When the results of the 3 studies were combined, most of the 743 relapses had occurred by Year 3 and nearly all the rest by Year 5. Among the prognostic factors universally available for study, three were highly associated with survival in all three studies: age, French-American-British disease classification, and white blood cell count at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the fact that most deaths occurred during the first 3 years, it is appropriate to report the results of clinical trials after patients have been followed for 4 years. Despite modest gains, the results of chemotherapy for AML remain disappointing, especially in the treatment of older patients.","['The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the University of Washington School of Medicine, and the Southwest Oncology Group, Seattle 98104, USA.']",,"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study examined the extended follow-up on these patients. METHODS: The analyses included cytogenetic and clinical data, with a median follow-up of 14.7 years, from 54 patients with treatment-associated AML and 628 with de novo AML. Of these patients, 291 received induction therapy that would be considered standard by today's criteria; no patient received high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) intensification. RESULTS: Among the patients with treatment-associated AML, the only long-term survivor in retrospect appears to have had de novo AML. Among the patients with de novo AML, achievement of complete remission and survival varied significantly based on cytogenetic classification among all 628 patients as well as among those who did and did not receive standard induction therapy. The remission rate and survival were significantly better with standard induction therapy for patients with t(15;17) and normal cytogenetics. Multivariate analyses showed that karyotype was an independent predictor of survival for all patients and those receiving standard induction therapy. Only 8.9% of patients were alive 5 years following diagnosis, but 5 years of continuous remission was synonymous with cure. Even among 5-year survivors who had suffered a previous relapse, 41% appeared to be cured. Survival among patients in continuous remission for > or = 10 years varied significantly by cytogenetic classification. In the absence of HiDAC intensification, no complete responders with t(8;21) and only 7% with normal cytogenetics survived continuously 10 years disease free. CONCLUSIONS: Cure of AML following specific therapies must be evaluated in the context of cytogenetics. A meta-analysis incorporating cytogenetic data is indicated for patients with > or = 10 years of follow-up.","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors therefore updated results from a 1981 report on a study conducted by the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center (UMMCC) and a 1989 report on a study conducted by the North American Marrow Transplant Group (NAMTG). METHODS: Minimum follow-up of 21.6 years for living patients was obtained for 26 patients who received weekly cytarabine and 6-thioguanine maintenance therapy after achieving complete remission (CR) in the UMMCC study. Minimum follow-up of 7.7 years was obtained on 87 patients treated with high dose cytarabine intensification in first remission in the NAMTG study. RESULTS: In the UMMCC study, the LFS rate was 28% and the overall survival rate was 15%. Nineteen percent of patients died in first CR at 1.3-12 years. Three patients remain alive in initial CR at >20 years. In the NAMTG study, the LFS rate was 49% and the overall survival rate was 45%. A total of 38 patients (44%) remain alive in initial CR at a median of 11.4 years after diagnosis. An additional patient is alive in second CR at 8.6 years after diagnosis. In both studies, relapses after 3 years were relatively uncommon (11-12%). CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy alone is curative in more than 40% of AML patients who achieve CR. Short-term, high dose cytarabine intensification appeared more efficacious, without increased toxicity, compared with low dose, prolonged cytarabine-based maintenance. However, for patients who cannot receive intensification, prolonged, low dose maintenance therapy is an acceptable alternative for achieving cure. A minimum follow-up of 3 years is a reasonable predictor of long-term survival and should be obtained in studies evaluating therapeutic outcome in cases of AML.","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparisons between the original data and longer-term follow-up data may be of interest, particularly with regard to promising new therapies. METHODS: In 1996, survival data were updated from three prospective, randomized comparisons of idarubicin and daunorubicin that began in 1984 and 1985. These were trials of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), the U.S. Multicenter Study Group, and the Southeastern Cancer Study Group (SEG). The original results of these trials were reported in 1991 and 1992. RESULTS: The original results of the SEG trial demonstrated no significant difference between idarubicin and daunorubicin. The updated survival analysis showed similar results. The MSKCC trial revealed a significant advantage of idarubicin compared with daunorubicin in both the original and the updated analyses. The U.S. Multicenter trial found a significant difference favoring idarubicin in the original analysis, but the difference was not significant in the updated analysis. CONCLUSIONS: It is essential that the median length of follow-up be clearly stated in any clinical trial. When the results obtained with a particularly promising new drug or procedure are presented early in the course of study (within 1-2 years), the investigators should strongly consider a repeat evaluation after an additional 3-5 years of follow-up.","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Less is known about the risk of such patients developing subsequent cancers or about their ability to return to work. METHODS: The authors analyzed outcomes among 1892 patients who received treatment for newly diagnosed AML at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1965 to May 1995. RESULTS: Because failure rates declined to relatively low levels after a first or later complete remission of > or = 3 years' duration, such patients comprised a ""potentially cured"" cohort. The criterion for entry into this cohort was fulfilled by 215 patients (10.7%; 203 in first complete remission and 12 in second remission). At a median of 6.2 years after entry into the cohort (i.e., 9.2 years from complete remission), 163 patients (76%) remain alive and in complete remission. Approximately 9% and 5% of the 1892 patients have been in complete remission for > 5 years and > 10 years, respectively. The pretreatment prognostic importance of cytogenetics is still apparent even after 5 years in complete remission. On average, members of the potentially cured cohort were not observed to be at increased risk of subsequent invasive malignancies compared with a normal population. Furthermore, two-thirds of those in the potentially cured cohort who were working full time before diagnosis of AML claimed to have returned to full-time work.

Suspicious or persistent masses are referred to the otolaryngologist who is faced with the dilemma of deciding which ones require surgical excision. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in adults helps distinguish lesions requiring excision from those that do not. Few reports exist of its use in children PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1991 and December 1994, 67 FNAs were performed on children, 29 of which (43%) were for head and neck masses. Based on the FNA findings, 16 patients underwent surgery. RESULTS: In 13 patients, the final pathology was consistent with the FNA findings: granulomatous diseases (3), branchial cysts (3), acute/chronic lymphadenitis (3), thyroglossal cyst, hemangioma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Castleman's disease (one each). There was one misdiagnosis, no false positives, and two nondiagnostic specimens. Based on the results of FNA, surgery was not performed in the remaining 10 patients. The cytology was: cervical lymphadenopathy (7), abscess formation (1), lymphangioma (1), and leukemia (1). CONCLUSION: We conclude that FNA in an extremely useful tool in the management of head and neck masses in children. It is very well-tolerated by children, and we did not encounter any complications.","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, West Virginia University, Morgantown 26506-9200, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These V gamma 9 V delta 2 T cells recognize the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-deficient B cell line Daudi and broadly distributed nonpeptidic antigens present in bacteria and parasites. Here we show that unlike alpha beta or V gamma 9- gamma delta T cells, the majority of V gamma 9V delta 2 T cells harbor natural killer inhibitory receptors (KIR) (mainly CD94/NKG2A heterodimers), which are known to deliver inhibitory signals upon interaction with MHC class I molecules. Within V gamma 9V delta 2 T cells, KIR were mainly expressed by clones exhibiting a strong lytic activity against Daudi cells. In stark contrast, almost all V gamma 9V delta 2 T cell clones devoid of killing activity were KIR-, thus suggesting a coordinate acquisition of KIR and cytotoxic activity within V gamma 9V delta 2 T cells. In functional terms, KIR inhibited lysis of MHC class I-positive tumor B cell lines by V gamma 9V delta 2 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and raised their threshold of activation by microbial antigens presented by MHC class I-positive cells. Furthermore, masking KIR or MHC class I molecules revealed a TCR-dependent recognition by V gamma 9V delta 2 CTL of ligands expressed by activated T lymphocytes, including the effector cells themselves. Taken together, these results suggest a general implication of V gamma 9V delta 2 T cells in immune response regulation and a central role of KIR in the control of self-reactive gamma delta CTL.","['INSERM U463, Institute de Biologie, Nantes, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An excisional biopsy of the inguinal node was performed. Histopathologic examination revealed abscess-forming granulomatous lymphadenitis compatible with cat scratch disease. A Warthin-Starry silver stain showed pleomorphic bacilli in the lymph node. So we confirmed a serological response to Bartonella henselae, the causative agent of cat scratch disease, using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The IgG antibody level to B. henselae was positive at 42 EIA Unit before treatment. After treatment with intravenous cefepime and oral tosufloxacin, his physical symptoms improved and the antibody level decreased to less than 12 EIA Unit.

Recently, that model was implemented as MarCell, a user-friendly MS-DOS computer program that allows users from a variety of technical disciplines to evaluate complex radiation exposure. The software allows menu selections for different sources of ionizing radiation. Choices for cell lineages include progenitor, stroma, and malignant, and the available species include mouse, rat, dog, sheep, swine, burro, and man. An attractive feature is that any protracted irradiation can be compared with an equivalent prompt dose (EPD) in terms of cell kinetics for either the source used or for a reference such as 250 kVp x rays or 60Co. EPD is used to mean a dose rate for which no meaningful biological recovery occurs during the period of irradiation. For human as species, output from MarCell includes: risk of 30-day mortality; risk of whole-body cancer and leukemia based either on radiation-induced cytopenia or compensatory cell proliferation; cell survival and repopulation plots as functions of time or dose; and 4-week recovery following treatment.","['Life Sciences Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee 37831, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based upon the criteria of nucleic acid homology > or =80%, all of the bovine VH gene sequences isolated from the expressed antibody repertoire constitute a single VH gene family, which we have designated as bovine VH1 (Bov VH1). An analysis of 44 bovine IgM-secreting mouse x cattle heterohybridomas, originating from polyclonally-activated PBLs from bovine leukemia virus-infected cattle, revealed that all of these expressed Bov VH1 (100%) based upon DNA sequencing and Northern dot blot. The bovine VH genes showed highest DNA sequence similarity, ranging between 81.5 and 87.6%, with a single sheep VH gene family (related to human VH4) and are, thus, closest to the VH genes from another ruminant species. The Bov VH1 gene family is most homologous to the murine VH Q-52 (71.8-78%) and human VH4 (67.4-69.8%) gene families, which belong to mammalian group, I, clan, II, VH genes. The CDR3 length of rearranged bovine VDJ genes is characteristically long (15-23 amino acids). The bovine JH gene segments were most homologous to human JH4 (82.1-87.2%) and JH5 (84.6-89.7%) genes, suggesting the existence of at least two JH gene segments. An analysis of CDRs provides evidence that somatic hypermutations contribute significantly to the generation of antibody diversity in cattle. Southern blot analysis of BamH I, EcoR I and Hind III digested genomic DNA from four cattle breeds (Holstein, Jersey, Hereford and Charolais) revealed three RFLP patterns; the genomic complexity of Bov VH1 ranged between 13 and 15 genes.

We show by photometric and polarographic methods, that didox and amidox are capable of forming an iron complex. However, their cytotoxic action cannot be completely circumvented by addition of Fe-ammoniumcitrate, indicating that the iron complexing capacity may not be responsible for the mechanism of action of these compounds.

RA increases the level of 2'5'oligoadenylate synthetase, p68 kinase, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and Sp100 in both HL-60 and WISH cells. Moreover, RA and IFN act cooperatively to increase the expression of these proteins. RA also inhibits vesicular stomatitis virus replication and induces a higher antiviral state and growth inhibition when combined with IFN. RA stimulates the IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) gene expression directly through the GAS motif and causes the induction and secretion of IFNalpha. Additional mechanisms could be involved as RA increases the level of signal transducing activators of transcription (STAT) proteins, and enhances the IFN-induced STAT activation, suggesting that cooperative effects by RA and IFN are mediated through multiple pathways.","['CNRS-UPR 9051, Hopital St Louis, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It transforms immature hematopoietic cells in vitro and abrogates IL-3-dependent growth. The mechanisms by which p210BCR-ABL mediates its oncogenicity are not well elucidated. Identifying transcription factors targeted by the chimeric protein may help to clarify these mechanisms. We have analysed the effect of p210BCR-ABL expression on NF-kappaB activity in DA1 cells (an IL-3-dependent murine myeloid progenitor cell line). A specific stimulation of NF-kappaB activity by kinase-active wild-type p210BCR-ABL has been evidenced by transcriptional activation assays. Electrophoretic mobility supershift assays revealed the presence of p65 protein (RelA) DNA binding activity in p210BCR-ABL transformed DA1 cells but not in parental DA1 cells. Activation of RelA in transformed DA1 cells may occur by protein stabilization. Experiments using oligonucleotides antisense to RelA showed that p210BCR-ABL transfected cells failed to survive after IL-3 removal. Moreover, inhibition of cellular growth was shown following treatment of p210BCR-ABL transformed DA1 cells by p65 antisense oligonucleotides. This study suggests that p65 NF-kappaB may be an effector for p210BCR-ABL and probably contributes to its induced transformation process.","['INSERM U124, Onco-Hematologie Moleculaire, Institut de Recherches sur le Cancer de Lille, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cyclosporin analogue SDZ PSC 833 [(3'-keto-Bmt1)-(Val2)-cyclosporin] (PSC 833) has been shown to possess powerful chemosensitization properties in vitro, in addition to being intrinsically nontoxic. However, coadministration of PSC 833 with anticancer drugs, such as daunorubicin, doxorubicin (DOX), and Taxol, have resulted in the exacerbation of anticancer drug toxicity, which is due to altered anticancer drug pharmacokinetics. Here, we hypothesized that optimization of the anticancer drug delivery, using liposomal carriers, may, by avoiding these adverse interactions, offer a significant advantage over nonencapsulated drugs. Toxicity studies were conducted in normal BDF1 mice, with i.v. DOX (free or liposome encapsulated) administration and p.o. PSC 833 in single and multiple dosage regimens over a 15-day study period. p.o. administration of PSC 833, at a dose of 100 mg/kg, reduced the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of i.v administered free drug by 2.5-3-fold, in single- and multiple-dose regimens. In contrast, PSC 833 administration resulted in only a 20% reduction of the MTD for DOX encapsulated in 100-nm 1,2 distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/cholesterol liposomes (55:45 molar lipid ratio) in a single-dose regimen and had no effect on the liposomal DOX MTD for the day 1, 5, and 9 treatment schedule. Modest modulation of P-glycoprotein-mediated MDR was observed in the murine P388/ADR solid tumor model when PSC 833 was administered with free DOX at the MTD. In contrast, liposomal DOX combined with PSC 833 resulted in tumor growth inhibition that was comparable to that observed for drug-sensitive P388/WT tumors. This efficacy of P388/ADR tumors treatment was dependent on PSC 833 because treatment with liposomal DOX alone provided significantly less antitumor activity. Pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution data demonstrated that DOX encapsulated in 1,2 distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/cholesterol liposomes exhibited comparable plasma elimination and tissue distribution properties in the presence and absence of PSC 833, whereas free DOX displayed reduced plasma elimination rates and altered tissue distribution in the presence of PSC 833. These results provide evidence that PSC 833 can induce P-glycoprotein modulation and chemosensitize MDR tumors in the absence of altered DOX pharmacokinetics when liposomal carriers are used. This suggests that the improved tumor selectivity of anticancer drugs that are administered in liposomal formulations may avoid the complications that are associated with free drug-MDR-reversing agent combinations and enhance the therapy of multidrug-resistant tumors.","['Department of Medical Oncology (Advanced Therapeutics), British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to identify the mechanism of such apoptosis resistance, a mRNA differential display analysis was used. Among a total of 12 bands with reduced expression in VC-33 cells, 1 cDNA clone was isolated that was hybridized to the wild-type transcript but not to the VC-33 transcript on Northern blotting. Partial sequence of this gene revealed 98% homology to mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5. When cell growth and intracellular ATP levels under glucose starvation were measured, VC-33 cells were found to be more sensitive than wild-type cells. Thus, NADH dehydrogenase deficiency may contribute, at least in part, to the mechanism of resistance to apoptosis in VC-33 cells.","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further investigate the mutational profile of this gene in human cancers, we examined a large set of human tumor specimens and cancer cell lines of many types for 10q23 allelic losses and MMAC1 sequence alterations. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the MMAC1 locus was observed in approximately one-half of the samples examined, consistent with the high frequency of 10q allelic loss reported for many cancers. Of 124 tumor specimens exhibiting LOH that have been screened for MMAC1 alterations to date, we have detected variants in 13 (approximately 10%) of these primary tumors; the highest frequency of variants was found in glioblastoma specimens (approximately 23%). Novel alterations identified in this gene include a missense variant in a melanoma sample and a splicing variant and a nonsense mutation in pediatric glioblastomas.

In addition, in this set of tumor cell lines, we detected 11 (approximately 14%) homozygous deletions that eliminated coding portions of MMAC1, a class of abnormality not detected by our methods in primary tumors.

To further characterize this interaction, we studied herein the effects of Et3Pb+ on the cell viability of normal and leukemic human lymphocytes and analysed the expression and dynamics of the monomer/polymer equilibrium of tubulin in these cells. Short- and long-term cell culture experiments demonstrated significantly different dose-dependent effects of Et3Pb+ on cell viability of leukemic compared to normal lymphocytes. Indeed, in the presence of increasing concentrations of Et3Pb+ (10(-12)-10(-5) M), primary cultures of chronic lymphocytes (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic (ALL) leukemic human Lymphocytes were much more sensitive to Et3Pb+ treatment when compared to normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). The IC50 values were approximately 5 x 10(-6) M for PBL and 8 x 10(-10) M for both CLL and ALL respectively, when cells were preincubated for 3 h with this agent. These experiments revealed a 1000-fold higher responsiveness of leukemic cells to Et3Pb+ treatment. Quantitative immunoblot analysis showed that leukemic cells express up to 4-fold higher total tubulin amounts. However, the proportion of polymerized tubulin in leukemic compared to normal lymphocytes increased only slightly (up to 1.4-fold). These findings reveal a significant decrease in the polymeric to total tubulin ratio in leukemic lymphocytes, indicating important modifications in tubulin dynamics and reorganization of the microtubular structures. Our results demonstrate that leukemic cells are much more sensitive than normal lymphocytes to Et3Pb+ action. This effect may be due to the altered monomer/polymer dynamic equilibrium of tubulin shown in leukemic cells. It is, therefore, worthwhile exploring future applied uses of Et3Pb+ as a potential suppressor of leukemic cell growth.","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, University of Crete and the University General Hospital, Heraklion, Greece.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The topoisomerase IIalpha activity levels remained reduced as the cells became increasingly more resistant. In contrast, the topoisomerase II mRNA and protein levels returned to approximately the parental levels in resistant cells growing in higher drug concentrations (40-160 ng/mL). Parental cells expressed the multidrug resistance protein (MRP), but beginning with PC4-A5 MRP expression decreased and remained reduced in increasingly resistant cell lines. At high levels of ADR resistance, the cells expressed the mdr3 gene concomitant with the appearance of vincristine resistance and energy-dependent daunomycin and vincristine efflux. Glutathione levels, internal pH, and expression of the major vault protein (MVP) remained unchanged in all cell lines. Fluorescence microscopy revealed no alterations in daunomycin distribution or vesicle numbers between the parental and resistant cell lines.

Both lymphomas are CD3+, CD4-, CD8- and T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha beta +. The cytotoxicity was not MHC restricted or dependent on the density of MHC class I of the target cells, and the mouse lymphoma killed the rat yolk sac tumour target. The cytotoxic action was fast and up to 80% specific killing was observed in 4-h 51Cr release assays. A rat B cell hybridoma was established from a Wistar/Furth (WF) rat immunized with the syngeneic lymphoma G1-Tc1 producing an immunoglobulin (Ig)G2c monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 1F2. This binds to the lymphomas G1-Tc1 and YAC-1 and also to a murine non-cytolytic Rauscher lymphoma RMA, but not to any other of several rat, mouse or human cell types tested. The 1F2 completely inhibited the killing of rat yolk sac tumours by the two cytolytic lymphomas, but did not interfere with the killing mediated by natural killer (NK) cells or cytolytic lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. Immunochemical analysis of solubilized cell membranes of the lymphoma G1-Tc1 demonstrates that the 1F2 antibody recognizes an epitope on a retroviral gp 70 envelope protein. This indicates that a retroviral protein is involved in the lytic activity of the two lymphomas.","['Department of Tumor Immunology, Wallenberg Laboratory, Lund University.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With their dual specificity BsAb may recognize effector cells (e.g. T cells) on one hand and tumour cells (e.g. malignant B cells) on the other hand. The authors analysed whether T cell activation and subsequent killing of malignant B cells mediated by the bispecific antibody CD3 x CD19 was reflected by the release of cytokines. In addition, the authors investigated whether the in vitro cytokine release was similar to that observed in vivo in the patients treated with BsAb. The in vitro release of cytokines into the supernatant of cell cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and malignant B cells was measured after incubation with either the bispecific antibody CD3 x CD19 or the monospecific anti-CD3 (aCD3) antibody in the presence or absence of interleukin (IL)-2. Release of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, soluble (s) CD4, sCD8 and sCD25 by PBMC was equal under both conditions and could be used as an indicator for T cell activation. However, the cytokine pattern and level did not correlate with the cytotoxic capacity, which was 4 logs higher with BsAb + IL-2 compared to aCD3 + IL-2. The in vitro pattern of cytokine release was similar to that observed in vivo in the serum of patients treated with BsAb and IL-2, indicating the possibility of predicting cytokine release in future patients with other therapeutic regimens.","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The level of topo II mRNA started to decrease immediately after the start of treatment with bufalin, with a subsequent decrease in the amount of topo II alpha protein. These changes preceded the fragmentation of DNA, a typical feature of apoptosis. The results suggest that bufalin caused a marked decrease in the steady-state level of topo II alpha mRNA, which led to a decrease in the amount and activity of the enzyme and to the induction of apoptosis. A reduction in the level of topo II alpha by bufalin was also observed in other lines of human leukemia cells such as ML1 and U937. The results were exploited to potentiate the effects of cisplatin and retinoic acid (RA) on HL-60 cells: pretreatment of HL-60 cells with 10(-7) M bufalin for 6 h increased the inhibitory effects of cisplatin and RA on cell growth and enhanced the induction of cell death.","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell line data suggest that reversal of MDR is possible using modifying drugs such as cyclosporin A (CSA) and its analogue PSC 833. We have investigated the effects on cell kill of the addition of CSA and PSC 833 to daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitozantrone, etoposide and cytarabine in 52 fresh cell samples from AML patients using an MTT assay. Pgp status was determined by using monoclonal antibodies JSB-1 and MRK-16 and by assessment of rhodamine efflux. Although overall each cytotoxic-modifier combination produced significant improvements in cell kill compared to cytotoxic alone (P values ranged from P < 0.001 to P = 0.017), modifiers also produced significant cytotoxicity in their own right, and no consistent difference was seen between responses in Pgp-positive and negative groups. Up to one in three Pgp-positive samples failed to show any improvement in cell kill with the addition of CSA or PSC 833, possibly owing to co-expression of alternative resistance mechanisms not affected by the MDR modifiers. The best responses were seen when PSC 833 was added to idarubicin, with 7 out of 22 Pgp-positive cases (32%) showing five-fold improvements in cell kill or better compared to idarubicin alone. Comparison of equimolar concentrations of the two modifiers in the Pgp positive group failed to show a significant difference in cell kill, though PSC 833 was markedly superior to CSA in a minority of highly responsive samples which demonstrated clear evidence of MDR reversal. Our in vitro data suggest that MDR modifiers such as CSA and PSC 833 could play an important role in the therapy of AML and indicate the need for prospective randomised trials to assess their clinical efficacy.","['University Department of Clinical Haematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the growth factor dependent MO7e cells, serum and growth factor starvation resulted in an early 50% fall in activity which was maintained over 24 h. Treatment of cells which growth factors or agents which induce differentiation activated AKT1. The subcellular localization of AKT1 in MO7e cells was altered as it was activated. High AKT1 kinase activity was associated with membrane fractions in stimulated cells, in contrast to the much lower AKT1 activity in membranes of cells starved of serum and growth factor for 1 h.

Using different lamin B2-specific antibodies, we detected two different lamin B2 species termed lamin B2 and B2A. Although phosphorylation of lamin B2 in leukemic cells was reminiscent of resting cells, the majority of ALL and AML samples showed significantly higher and more altered lamin B2A phosphorylation compared to PBMC.

It is exclusively expressed in myeloid and T-lymphoid cells and appears to have an important role in inducing expression of several myeloid-specific genes. We used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique to examine DNA from 93 hamster/human radiation hybrid clones in order chromosomally to map C/EBP-epsilon to 14q11.2 (between D14S264 and D14S275) which is telomeric to the T-cell receptor alpha and delta genes and centromeric to several other myeloid gene products including Cathepsin G (CTSG) and Chymase-1 (CMA1). To determine whether C/EBP-epsilon behaves as an altered tumor-suppressor gene, samples from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) evolving to AML were studied for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using microsatellite sequences that we identified within 0.2 kb of the amino-terminus of the human C/EBP-epsilon gene. Allelic loss of the C/EBP-epsilon gene was detected in four out of 20 (20%) evolving MDS cases and in none of the 17 AML and 17 T-cell leukemia cases. Mutational analysis of the gene was performed using PCR-SSCP on 37 AML and 40 MDS cases including those with LOH at the gene. No abnormalities were found suggesting that the altered gene in this region is not C/EBP-epsilon. Also, C/EBP-epsilon was examined by Southern blot analysis on DNA samples from 20 AML patients and 10 AML cell lines. No rearrangements or amplifications of the gene were detected. Taken together, we have mapped C/EBP-epsilon to 14q11.2, a region containing other myeloid and T-lymphoid specific genes. Furthermore, no structural alterations were detected in the C/EBP-epsilon gene.","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine 90048, USA.']",,"['CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70675-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-nine patients (24 pre-B and 5 of T-cell lineage) were investigated for loss of heterozygosity (LOH), using 49 highly polymorphic markers distributed over 13 chromosomal arms which are known or postulated to contain TSGs. The highest rates of allelic losses were observed in chromosomes 9p and 12p which were deleted in 29 and 32% of the informative patients, respectively. These are among the most frequent alterations found in childhood ALL. Other losses were found at a lower frequency in chromosomes 6p, 6q, 9q, 17p, and 17q. No LOH was found at chromosomes 3p, 5q, 11p, 11q, 13q and 18q in any patient.

Since achievement of a second complete remission (CR) is the initial step in successful retreatment effort, it is important to develop salvage protocols for children with relapsed or refractory ALL. In the present study, we developed a new salvage protocol (MLL-93) and applied the concept of dual chemical modulation of cytarabine, hydroxyurea, and etoposide with the alternative administration of high doses of myeloid- and lymphoid-directed agents. We also planned to perform allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) following a CR if patients had HLA-identical donor(s). The six patients treated with the MLL-93 protocol achieved a second CR. One patients in CR died of interstitial pneumonia after an unrelated allogeneic BMT. The other five patients have been in CR for 12-41 months.

From our routine biopsy material we collected four cases of haematological malignancies presenting as acute appendicitis or acute abdomen, caused or accompanied by tumoral infiltration of the appendix. Appendicitis was the initial manifestation that allowed diagnosis of the underlying disease. The clinical histories and histological examinations of the appendices and of one autopsy are described. We report the first detailed description of acute myeloid leukaemia involving the appendix, and three cases of lymphomatous infiltration of the appendix presenting with appendicitis, and give an overview of the literature. In these days of budgetary cuts in national health services, where one may be tempted not to have seemingly commonplace cases of appendicitis histologically verified, our cases emphasize that careful histopathological examination of all appendectomy specimens should be mandatory. Despite the fact that leukaemia and lymphoma of the appendix are rare, our cases illustrate that these must be included in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis and that physicians and surgeons have to be aware of these conditions.","['Department of Pathology, Jules Bordet Institute, Free University of Brussels, Belgium.']",,,46,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the expressions of RB protein and cyclin A protein in 13 small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) lines and 14 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lines by immunoblotting. RB protein was not present or was of a mutant type in 77% of the SCLC lines (10/13) but was present in all the NSCLC lines. Cyclin A was expressed in 38% of the SCLC lines (5/13) and in 86% of the NSCLC lines (12/14). A positive correlation (P = 0.0034) between expression of cyclin A and wild-type RB protein was found by Fisher's exact probability test. Densitometric analysis of the expression of RB protein in RB(+) lung cancer lines showed that the phosphorylated form was predominant in 2/3 of the SCLC and 8/14 of the NSCLC lines. The positive correlation between the expressions of RB protein and cyclin A suggests that RB protein in most RB(+) lung cancer cell lines is a target of cyclin-A-dependent kinase and that the tumor-suppressor function may be inactivated by phosphorylation.,"['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Tokushima University School of Medicine, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Great Britain. SUBJECTS: 35,949 children diagnosed as having cancer, together with matched controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parental employment as radiation worker as defined by inclusion in the National Registry for Radiation Workers and being monitored for external radiation before conception of child; cumulative dose of external ionising radiation for various periods of employment before conception; dose during pregnancy. RESULTS: After cases studied by Gardner and colleagues were excluded, fathers of children with leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma were significantly more likely than fathers of controls to have been radiation workers (relative risk 1.77, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 3.03) but there was no dose-response relation for any of the exposure periods studied; indeed, the association was greatest for those with doses below the level of detection. No increased risk was found for fathers with a lifetime preconception dose of 100 mSv or more, or with a dose in the 6 months before conception of 10 mSv or more. There was no increased risk for the group of other childhood cancers. Mothers' radiation work was associated with a significant increase of childhood cancer (relative risk 5.00, 1.42 to 26.94; based on 15 cases and 3 controls). Only four of the case mothers and no controls were radiation workers during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the hypothesis that paternal preconception irradiation is a cause of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma; the observed associations may be chance findings or results from exposure to infective or other agents. If there is any increased risk for the children of fathers who are radiation workers, it is small in absolute terms: in Britain the average risk by age 15 years is 6.5 per 10,000; our best estimate, using all available data, is that the increase is 5.4 per 10,000. For mothers, the numbers are too small for reliable estimates of the risk, if any, to be made.","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford. gjd@ccrg.ox.ac.uk']","['BMJ. 1998 May 30;316(7145):1672; author reply 1673.

Such patients have a decreased survival time, compared with the survival time among patients without weight loss, and loss of total body protein leads to substantial impairment of respiratory muscle function. These changes cannot be fully explained by the accompanying anorexia, and nutritional supplementation alone is unable to reverse the wasting process. Despite a falling caloric intake, patients with cachexia frequently show an elevated resting energy expenditure as a result of increases in Cori cycle (i.e., catalytic conversion of lactic acid to glucose) activity, glucose and triglyceride-fatty acid cycling, and gluconeogenesis. A number of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-apha, interleukins 1 and 6, interferon gamma, and leukemia-inhibitory factor, have been proposed as mediators of the cachectic process. However, the results of a number of clinical and laboratory studies suggest that the action of the cytokines alone is unable to explain the complex mechanism of wasting in cancer cachexia. In addition, cachexia has been observed in some xenograft models even without a cytokine involvement, suggesting that other factors may be involved. These probably include catabolic factors, which act directly on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and the presence of which has been associated with the clinical development of cachexia. A polyunsaturated fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, attenuates the action of such catabolic factors and has been shown to stabilize the process of wasting and resting energy expenditure in patients with pancreatic cancer. Such a pharmacologic approach may provide new insights into the treatment of cachexia.",,"['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1998 Apr 15;90(8):628.

The present study was designed for prospective evaluation of coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters in leukaemic children receiving different ASP preparations during the course of re-induction. Forty leukaemic children receiving ASP (Medac: n = 13; Bayer: n = 10; Erwinia: n = 17) at 3-day intervals during re-induction were enrolled in this study. Blood samples for coagulation studies were obtained before each ASP administration together with serum samples for pharmacokinetic monitoring. Compared with Medac ASP 10,000 IU/m2, patients receiving Bayer ASP or Erwinia ASP showed significantly higher fibrinogen values. Antithrombin and plasminogen showed normal values in children after Erwinia ASP. Alpha2-antiplasmin and D-Dimer were no different in the groups studied. Neither side-effects, nor sustained asparagine depletion was observed in the majority of children treated with Erwinia ASP. CONCLUSION: Data of this study show a down-regulation of coagulation proteins in children treated with Medac ASP, less pronounced in patients after Bayer or Erwinia ASP. Since children treated with Erwinia ASP showed no adequate asparagine depletion during the course of ASP therapy, a dose adjustment should be discussed to guarantee asparagine depletion, the specific metabolic therapy for ALL.","[""Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Munster, Germany.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Direct evidence for a prenatal origin can only be derived by prospective or retrospective detection of leukemia-specific molecular abnormalities in fetal or newborn samples. We report a PCR-based method that has been developed to scrutinize neonatal blood spots (Guthrie cards) for the presence of numerically infrequent leukemic cells at birth in individuals who subsequently developed leukemia. We demonstrate that unique or clonotypic MLL-AF4 genomic fusion sequences are present and detectable in neonatal blood spots from individuals who were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at ages 5 months to 2 years and, therefore, have arisen during fetal hematopoiesis in utero. This result provides unequivocal evidence for a prenatal initiation of acute leukemia in young patients.

The mechanism of HTLV-I oncogenesis in T cells remains partly elusive. In vitro, HTLV-I induces ligand-independent transformation of human CD4+ T cells, an event that correlates with acquisition of constitutive phosphorylation of Janus kinases (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins. However, it is unclear whether the in vitro model of HTLV-I transformation has relevance to viral leukemogenesis in vivo. Here we tested the status of JAK/STAT phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity of STAT proteins in cell extracts of uncultured leukemic cells from 12 patients with ATLL by either DNA-binding assays, using DNA oligonucleotides specific for STAT-1 and STAT-3, STAT-5 and STAT-6 or, more directly, by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody for JAK and STAT proteins. Leukemic cells from 8 of 12 patients studied displayed constitutive DNA-binding activity of one or more STAT proteins, and the constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway was found to persist over time in the 2 patients followed longitudinally. Furthermore, an association between JAK3 and STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-5 activation and cell-cycle progression was demonstrated by both propidium iodide staining and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in cells of four patients tested. These results imply that JAK/STAT activation is associated with replication of leukemic cells and that therapeutic approaches aimed at JAK/STAT inhibition may be considered to halt neoplastic growth.","['Basic Research Laboratory, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",,,,,PMC28404,,,,,,,,,,

LIM-only proteins are presumed to act primarily through protein-protein interactions. We, and others, have identified a widely expressed protein, Ldb1, whose C-terminal 76-residues are sufficient to mediate interaction with LMO2. In murine erythroleukemia cells, the endogenous Lbd1 and LMO2 proteins exist in a stable complex, whose binding affinity appears greater than that between LMO2 and the bHLH transcription factor SCL. However, Ldb1, LMO2, and SCL/E12 can assemble as a multiprotein complex on a consensus SCL binding site. Like LMO2, the Ldb1 gene is expressed in fetal liver and erythroid cell lines. Forced expression of Ldb1 in G1ER proerythroblast cells inhibited cellular maturation, a finding compatible with the decrease in Ldb1 gene expression that normally occurs during erythroid differentiation. Overexpression of the LMO2 gene also inhibited erythroid differentiation. Our studies demonstrate a function for Ldb1 in hemopoietic cells and suggest that one role of the Ldb1/LMO2 complex is to maintain erythroid precursors in an immature state.","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",,,,['GENBANK/AF030333'],PMC28370,,,,,,,,,,

IL-6-differentiated B cells die by apoptosis, as evidenced by increases in Annexin V binding activity, PARP cleavage, and chromatin disorganization.

Fractalkine, a novel transmembrane molecule with a CX3C-motif chemokine domain atop a mucin stalk, induces both adhesion and migration of leukocytes. Here we identify a seven-transmembrane high-affinity receptor for fractalkine and show that it mediates both the adhesive and migratory functions of fractalkine. The receptor, now termed CX3CR1, requires pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein signaling to induce migration but not to support adhesion, which also occurs without other adhesion molecules but requires the architecture of a chemokine domain atop the mucin stalk. Natural killer cells predominantly express CX3CR1 and respond to fractalkine in both migration and adhesion. Thus, fractalkine and CX3CR1 represent new types of leukocyte trafficking regulators, performing both adhesive and chemotactic functions.","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Settsu, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the importance of early diagnosis by tissue biopsy and early treatment with surgical debridement and systemic antifungal therapy cannot be overemphasized.

Peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation in response to phytohaemagglutinin, concanavalin A, recombinant interleukin-2, dextran sulphate, Pisum sativatum agglutinin and wheat germ agglutinin was investigated. Serum immunoglobulin and beta 2 microglobulin levels were determined. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, follicle-stimulating hormone luteinizing hormone, 17 beta-oestradiol, testosterone, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, thyroglobulin and thyrotropic hormone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Active and indolent CLL presented differences in immunological characteristics, as demonstrated by the more severe suppression of T lymphocyte function, reduced IgA level and considerably higher serum beta 2-microglobulin values in active disease. Immune disturbances were accompanied by hormonal imbalance, depending on disease status: lower ACTH, cortisol and triiodothyronine levels were established to occur in active CLL compared to indolent disease. Male patients demonstrated striking changes in sex hormones, which were more evident in active disease.

Although a sequence identical to previously determined Pbx-binding sites is not present in the promoter region of the human CYP17 gene, three putative Pbx-binding sites are identified by sequence similarity analysis. Coexpression of Pbx1 and a catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) greatly enhances reporter gene transcription via the 5'-flanking region of the human CYP17 gene. Upon gel shift analysis utilizing nuclear extracts from human adrenal H295R cells, one of the three putative Pbx1-binding sites, -250/-241 bp, shows the typical intense doublet observed with other Pbx-binding sites. 5'-Deletion analyses of the reporter construct containing this Pbx-binding site showed approximately sixfold induction by coexpression of Pbx1 and PKA compared to the basal transcription, suggesting that Pbx1 binds the -250/-241 bp sequence and participates in cAMP-dependent regulation of the human CYP17 gene.","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-0146, USA.']",,"['1R01HD33852-01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'DK28350/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'ES00267/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently described the production of AC133, a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) that binds to a novel cell surface antigen present on a CD34(bright) subset of human HSCs. This antigen is a glycosylated protein with a molecular weight of 120 kD. Here, we report the molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding this antigen and show that it does not share homology with any previously described hematopoietic or other cell surface antigen(s). The AC133 polypeptide has a predicted size of 97 kD and contains five-transmembrane (5-TM) domains with an extracellular N-terminus and a cytoplasmic C-terminus. Whereas the expression of tetraspan (4-TM) and 7-TM molecules is well documented on mature and immature hematopoietic cells and leukocytes, this 5-TM type of structure containing two large (255-amino acid [aa] and 290-aa) extracellular loops is unique and does not share sequence homology with any known multi-TM family members. Expression of this protein appears limited to bone marrow in normal tissue by immunohistochemical staining; however, Northern analysis suggests that the mRNA transcript is present in a variety of tissues such as the kidney, pancreas, placenta, and fetal liver. The AC133 antigen is also expressed on subsets of CD34+ leukemias, suggesting that it may be an important early marker for HSCs, as well as the first described member of a new class of TM receptors.","['AmCell Corp, Sunnyvale, CA 94089, USA.']",,,,"['GENBANK/AF027208', 'GENBANK/AF039663']",,,,,,,,,,,

AC133 antigen is selectively expressed on CD34(bright) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (progenitors) derived from human fetal liver and bone marrow, and blood. It is not detectable on other blood cells, cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), fibroblast cell lines, or the myeloid leukemia cell line KG1a by standard flow cytometric procedures. All of the noncommitted CD34(+) cell population, as well as the majority of CD34(+) cells committed to the granulocytic/monocytic pathway, are stained with AC133 antibody. In vitro clonogenicity assays have demonstrated that the CD34(+)AC133(+) double-positive population from adult bone marrow contains the majority of the CFU-GM, a proportion of the CFU-Mix, and a minor population of BFU-E. The CD34(dim) and AC133(-) population has been shown to contain the remaining progenitor cells. AC133-selected cells engraft successfully in a fetal sheep transplantation model, and human cells harvested from chimeric fetal sheep bone marrow have been shown to successfully engraft secondary recipients, providing evidence for the long-term repopulating potential of AC133(+) cells. A cDNA coding for AC133 antigen has been isolated, which codes for a polypeptide consisting of 865 amino acids (aa) with a predicted size of 97 kD. This antigen is modeled as a 5-transmembrane molecule, a structure that is novel among known cell surface structures. AC133 antibody provides an alternative to CD34 for the selection and characterization of cells necessary for both short- and long-term engraftment, in transplant situations, for studies of ex vivo expansion strategies, and for gene therapy.","['AmCell Corp, Sunnyvale, CA 94089, USA.']",,"['AI35940/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL49042/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL52955/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,['GENBANK/AF027208'],,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, soluble tumor-derived DNA was analyzed in serum and plasma samples of patients with B-cell malignancies. DNA was extracted from tumor cell specimens as well as serum and plasma samples collected from 110 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute B-precursor lymphoblastic leukemia and was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain DNA. In 54% of serum or plasma samples analyzed at different times before and during treatment, clonal DNA from a rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain locus was detectable. When examined at diagnosis and before any treatment, clonotypic DNA was found in serum or plasma of 86% of the patients. Serum or plasma from patients with systemic or bulky disease was uniformly PCR positive, whereas clonotypic DNA was also recovered from the serum or plasma from the majority of patients with limited disease stages. Degradation of clonal DNA by nucleases in vitro was shown to be one cause of false-negative PCR results. This technical drawback can be relieved by adding a nuclease inhibitor like EDTA, ie, by using plasma instead of serum for PCR analysis. Treatment of patients with cytotoxic drugs was followed by rapid clearance of DNA from the peripheral blood, suggesting that soluble tumor-derived DNA might be associated with viable and proliferating tumor cells. Follow-up studies showed a close correlation of persisting soluble tumor-derived DNA with resistant disease or early relapse. In summary, these data suggest that tumor-derived DNA can be detected in serum or plasma of the majority of patients with B-cell malignancies and that testing of serum or plasma for tumor-associated DNA may be a novel parameter for monitoring response to treatment.","['Department of Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that CGP 57148 selectively kills p210BCR-ABL-expressing cells. To extend these observations, we evaluated the ability of CGP 57148 to inhibit other activated ABL tyrosine kinases, including p185BCR-ABL and TEL-ABL. In cell-based assays of ABL tyrosine phosphorylation, inhibition of ABL kinase activity was observed at concentrations similar to that reported for p210BCR-ABL. Consistent with the in vitro profile of this compound, the growth of cells expressing activated ABL protein tyrosine kinases was inhibited in the absence of exogenous growth factor. Growth inhibition was also observed with a p185BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cell line generated from a Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL patient. As CGP 57148 inhibits the PDGFR kinase, we also showed that cells expressing an activated PDGFR tyrosine kinase, TEL-PDGFR, are sensitive to this compound. Thus, this compound may be useful for the treatment of a variety of BCR-ABL-positive leukemias and for treatment of the subset of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients with a TEL-PDGFR fusion protein.","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon 97201-3098, USA.']",,['CA01422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and by screening for the TEL/AML1 rearrangement by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), it has been demonstrated to be the most frequent known structural chromosomal abnormality in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is closely correlated with a B-cell precursor (BCP) phenotype and is considered a favorable prognostic factor. However, little is known about the incidence of the translocation in relapsed patients and the duration of complete remission (CR) in children expressing the TEL/AML1 fusion gene. We therefore examined 49 bone marrow samples from children with ALL at first or second relapse that were consecutively mailed to our laboratory to test for the presence of t(12; 21) using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. The TEL/AML1 rearrangement could be identified in nine of 44 (20%) of the patients, a result similar to the reported incidence at diagnosis. Most of the TEL/AML1-positive children showed no adverse clinical features at diagnosis (eg, white blood cell [WBC] count <100 x 10(9)/L or age <10 years), and regarding these data, there were no differences versus children who were negative for the fusion gene. However, the period of remission was about 1 year longer in children expressing TEL/AML1 (P = .046), and the majority of relapses in this group appeared late (<2 years after diagnosis). Our findings therefore reinforce the urgent need for further prospective studies with a long follow-up period to determine the true prognostic significance of t(12; 21) and to avoid premature changes of treatment strategies.","[""Department of General Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Children's University Hospital, Giessen, Germany.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the long latency period between infection and development of ATL, as well as the small fraction of the infected population that actually develops this disease, suggest that factors in addition to the virus are involved in its pathogenesis. Mutation of tumor suppressor gene p53 has been found in both HTLV-I-transformed T-cell lines and ATL cases at relatively low frequency. However, increasing evidence supports p53 functional impairment in HTLV-I-transformed T cells. Tax, the major transactivator of HTLV-I, is critical for the initial events involved in transformation. We have considered the possibility that p53 may regulate transcription of viral and cellular genes important for viral replication and transformation. Inactivation of p53 function might then permit constitutive expression of these viral and cellular genes. We have investigated the effects of wild-type and mutant p53 on Tax-mediated activation of the HTLV-I long terminal repeat (LTR) and the promoters of several cellular genes including the interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF ), and IL-2 receptor alpha chain gene. Jurkat, HuT78, and U937 cells were cotransfected with plasmids containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT ) reporter gene under viral or cellular promoter control and the Tax expression vector, in addition to vectors for a wild-type or mutant p53. Wild-type p53 is a potent repressor of viral and cellular activation by Tax. Mutations within p53 severely inhibit this downregulation. We also show that wild-type p53 suppresses transcription from the HTLV-I LTR in Jurkat-Tax, a T-cell line stably expressing Tax, and MT-2, a HTLV-I-transformed T-cell line. Wild-type, but not mutant, p53 interfered with the binding of TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the TATA motif of the HTLV-I LTR.

The clinical implications of this finding are the subject of the present study in which samples of CML patients, including a group treated with interferon alpha (IFNalpha) were surveyed. The methylation status of the abl promoter was monitored by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the Pa region after digestion with several site-methylation sensitive restriction enzymes. Some 74% of the DNA samples from blood and marrow drawn in the chronic phase were nonmethylated, similar to control samples from non-CML patients. The remaining 26% were partially methylated in the abl Pa region. The latter samples were derived from patients who were indistinguishable from the others on the basis of clinical presentation. Methylated samples were mostly derived from patients known to have a disease of longer duration (26 months v 7.5 months, P = .01). Samples of 30 IFNalpha-treated patients were sequentially analyzed in the course of treatment. Fifteen patients with no evidence of Pa methylation before treatment remained methylation-free. The remainder, who displayed Pa methylation before treatment, reverted to the methylation-free status. The outcome is attributed to IFNalpha therapy, as the Pa methylation status was not reversed in any of the patients treated with hydroxyurea. Methylation of the abl promoter indicates a disease of long-standing, most likely associated with a higher probability of imminent blastic transformation. It appears to predict the outcome of IFNalpha therapy far better than the cytogenetic response.","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah Hospital and The Lautenberg Center for Immunology, The Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used a severe combined immunodeficient/nonobese diabetic (SCID/NOD) mouse model of JMML and examined the effect of inhibiting these cytokines in vivo with the human GM-CSF antagonist and apoptotic agent E21R and the anti-TNFalpha monoclonal antibody (MoAb) cA2 on JMML cell growth and dissemination in vivo. We show here that JMML cells repopulated to high levels in the absence of exogeneous growth factors. Administration of E21R at the time of transplantation or 4 weeks after profoundly reduced JMML cell load in the mouse bone marrow. In contrast, MoAb cA2 had no effect on its own, but synergized with E21R in virtually eliminating JMML cells from the mouse bone marrow. In the spleen and peripheral blood, E21R eliminated JMML cells, while MoAb cA2 had no effect. Importantly, studies of mice engrafted simultaneously with cells from both normal donors and from JMML patients showed that E21R preferentially eliminated leukemic cells. This is the first time a specific GM-CSF inhibitor has been used in vivo, and the results suggest that GM-CSF plays a major role in the pathogenesis of JMML.

A recent study also showed that the Fas (CD95/APO1) mediates apoptotic signal from cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Sixty-four patients with AML were studied for the expression of Fas in the context of CD34 and CD38 coexpression. The clinical relevance of Fas expression and function on AML was also investigated. Fas was expressed on 2% to 98% of AML cells (2% to 20% in 11 patients, 20% to 50% in 20 patients, 50% to 80% in 24 patients, and 80% to 98% in nine patients). Only 44.4% of patients with AML M1 (French-American-British [FAB] classification) were Fas+ (>/=20% of leukemia cells expressed Fas), whereas 89.1% of patients with AML M2, M3, M4, M5 were Fas+ (P < .01). Among 43 CD34+ patients (>/=20% leukemia cells were CD34+), 34 were Fas+, and 19 of 21 CD34- patients were Fas+ (P = NS). Thirteen cases were studied for their expression of Fas in the context of CD34 and CD38 using three-color analysis. Fas is expressed at a high level in the gated CD34+CD38+/- and CD34+CD38+ population. In 10 AML samples, Fas was expressed at a higher level in CD34+/CD38+ population than in CD34+/CD38+/- or CD34- cell populations. Fas-induced apoptosis by anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (MoAb) was determined by morphologic features and colorimetric DNA fragmentation assay. Induction of apoptosis was found in 14 of 24 cases. However, no statistically significant correlation was observed between Fas expression and induction of apoptosis. Leukemia colony-forming unit assays suggested that in some cases, Fas-induced apoptosis occurred in the clonogenic cell populations. Parameters such as laboratory and clinical data at initial diagnosis were correlated with Fas expression and only response to initial induction chemotherapy showed significant correlation with Fas expression (P < .05). We conclude that the majority of AML cells exhibit variable expression of Fas, and apoptosis could be induced by anti-Fas MoAb in some cases. Our results suggest the Fas-mediated apoptosis may be clinically relevant, whereas the issue of clonogenic leukemia cells and Fas expression needs further studies.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have characterized 7 cases of morphologic APL found to lack the t(15; 17) on conventional cytogenetic assessment. In 6 of 7 cases, cryptic PML-RARalpha rearrangements were identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH); whereas, in the remaining patient, APL was associated with the variant translocation, t(11; 17)(q23; q12-21), leading to the formation of PLZF-RARalpha and RARalpha-PLZF fusion genes. In each of the cases with cryptic PML-RARalpha rearrangements, PML-RARalpha transcripts were detected in the absence of RARalpha-PML, consistent with the concept that PML-RARalpha is the critical oncogenic fusion protein. In 4 of these cases with evaluable metaphase spreads, the occurrence of a nonreciprocal translocation was confirmed by FISH with sole formation of the PML-RARalpha fusion gene; in 3 cases with morphologically normal chromosomes 15 and 17, RARalpha was inserted into PML on 15q, whereas in the remaining patient the PML-RARalpha fusion arose due to insertion of 15q-derived material including PML into RARalpha on 17q. Immunofluorescence studies were performed using antibodies raised against PML and PIC 1, a ubiquitin-homology domain protein previously identified as an interaction partner of PML. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of subtypes other than M3, PIC 1 was localized to the nuclear membrane and colocalized with PML within discrete nuclear bodies. In APL cases with cryptic PML-RARalpha rearrangements, the characteristic microparticulate pattern of PML staining was detected with partial colocalization with PIC 1, indicative of disruption of the nuclear bodies; whereas in t(11; 17)-associated APL, PML and PIC 1 remained colocalized within discrete nuclear bodies, as observed in non-APL cases. Although deregulation of the putative growth suppressor PML and delocalization of other nuclear body constituents have been advocated to play a key role in the development of t(15; 17)-associated APL, the present study shows that disruption of PML nuclear bodies per se is not a prerequisite for the pathogenesis of APL.","['Cancer Genetics Laboratory, Division of Medical & Molecular Genetics, UMDS, London, UK.']",,['A3585/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a significant reduction in the number of patients requiring systemic antifungal therapy in the filgrastim group during induction treatment (34% v 43%; P = .04). In conclusion, filgrastim is safe in that it had no negative impact on the prognosis of the AML patients.

The presence of the BCR/ABL oncoprotein is necessary and sufficient for malignant transformation seen in CML. We thus hypothesized that transfer of a vector that combines a drug-resistance gene with anti-BCR/ABL antisense (AS) sequences may allow for posttransplant chemotherapy to decrease persistent disease while rendering inadvertently transduced CML stem and progenitor cells functionally normal. We constructed a retroviral vector, LasBD, that combines the methotrexate (MTX)-resistant tyrosine-22 dihydrofolate-reductase (tyr22-DHFR) gene and AS sequences directed at the b3a2 BCR/ABL breakpoint. b3a2 BCR/ABL containing 32D and MO7e cells were transduced with LasBD and selected in MTX for 14 days. Expression of the AS sequences reduced BCR/ABL mRNA and p210(BCR/ABL) protein levels by 6- to 10-fold in most cells. This subsequently led to the restoration of normal function of BCR/ABL cDNA+ cells: they grew significantly slower in the presence of interleukin-3 (IL-3); they underwent apoptotic cell death when cultured without IL-3; and they had restored expression and function of adhesion receptors. These effects were specific, because LasBD-containing AS sequences directed at the b3a2 BCR/ABL breakpoint did not affect p190(BCR/ABL)-containing cells. LasBD also rendered 20% to 30% of primary Ph- and Ph+ CD34(+) cells MTX-resistant and decreased BCR/ABL mRNA levels in MTX resistant Ph+ CD34(+) cells by 10-fold. Expression of the MTX-resistant DHFR gene and the AS sequences has been stable for at least 1 year in vitro and for more than 70 days in vivo. Finally, LasBD decreased tumorigenicity of 32DBCR/ABL cells in vivo by 3 to 4 logs. In conclusion, the tyr22-DHFR gene in the LasBD vector can protect normal hematopoietic cells from MTX-mediated toxicity, whereas the AS sequences in LasBD can suppress expression of the BCR/ABL gene and restore normal function of BCR/ABL cDNA-containing cells. The LasBD vector may therefore prove to be an extremely useful adjunct in autologous transplantation for CML.","['Stem Cell Biology Program, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",,"['P01-CA-65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-60803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-54039/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested the effects of IL-6 and its soluble receptor (IL-6sR) on the expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-II in cultured osteoblast-enriched cells from fetal rat calvariae (Ob cells). IL-6 did not modify IGF-I messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, but when tested in the presence of IL-6sR, IL-6 at 1 to 100 ng/ml increased IGF-I transcripts by up to 3.2-fold after 24 h. IL-6sR caused a small increase in IGF-I mRNA levels when tested alone. IL-6 and IL-6sR increased immunoreactive IGF-I levels by 2.4-fold after 24 h and 6.4-fold after 48 h. Cycloheximide prevented, and indomethacin markedly decreased, the effect of IL-6 and IL-6sR on IGF-I mRNA levels, but hydroxyurea did not. IL-6 and IL-6sR did not alter the decay of IGF-I mRNA in transcriptionally arrested Ob cells, and the half-life of the predominant 6.5-kb IGF-I transcript was about 11 h in control and treated cells. In addition, IL-6 and IL-6sR increased the levels of IGF-I heterogeneous nuclear RNA. IL-11 also increased IGF-I mRNA levels, whereas oncostatin M and leukemia-inhibitory factor did not. In contrast to their effects on IGF-I, IL-6 and IL-6sR caused only a modest increase in IGF-II mRNA and polypeptide levels. In conclusion, IL-6, in the presence of IL-6sR, increases IGF-I synthesis in Ob cells; this effect may lead to a secondary increase in bone formation.","['Department of Research, Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, Hartford, Connecticut 06105, USA.']",,['DK-42424/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This protein belongs to a newly identified phosphate transporter/retrovirus receptor gene family distinct from renal type I and II NaPi transporters. Although inorganic phosphate (Pi) transport is an important function of osteoblasts and of the matrix vesicles produced by these cells in the context of bone matrix calcification, the molecular identity of the NaPi transport system(s) present in this cell type is still unknown. In contrast to Pi uptake mediated by renal NaPi transporters, the activities of both the osteoblastic transport system and Glvr-1 are decreased at alkaline pH, and this observation led us to investigate expression of this transporter in human SaOS-2 osteosarcoma cells. Northern blotting analysis revealed the presence of a 4-kilobase Glvr-1 transcript. The expression of Glvr-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) was increased in response to insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Associated with this effect, a selective, dose- and time-dependent stimulation of NaPi transport was observed. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide abolished the increase in NaPi transport, which thus appeared to be dependent on RNA and protein synthesis. The increase in Glvr-1 mRNA induced by IGF-I was dose dependent and transient, peaking after 4 h (approximately 4-fold increase in response to 10(-7) M IGF-I). It preceded the maximal expression of NaPi transport stimulation (173-235% of control), which was observed after 18-24 h. Induction of Glvr-1 mRNA expression by IGF-I was inhibited by actinomycin D, suggesting that this effect was related to an increase in gene transcription. The stability of Glvr-1 mRNA was not altered by IGF-I, and Glvr-1 mRNA induction did not require the synthesis of new proteins. These data demonstrate for the first time regulated expression of mRNA encoding the type III NaPi transporter Glvr-1 in osteoblast-like cells. They also suggest that this new transporter family may be involved in Pi handling in osteogenic cells and in its regulation by osteotropic factors.","['Department of Medicine, University of Geneva, Switzerland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells have the capacity to differentiate in the presence of vitamin D into cells with osteoclast-like properties. Differentiated cells displayed higher rates of aromatase than undifferentiated cells, and, in both cases, activity was stimulated 10- to 20-fold by dexamethasone. Phorbol esters also increased aromatase activity, but the effect was the same in differentiated as in undifferentiated cells. In a similar fashion to adipose stromal cells, serum potentiated the response to dexamethasone but had no effect on phorbol ester-stimulated activity. By contrast to its action in adipose stromal cells, (Bu)2cAMP markedly inhibited aromatase activity of THP-1 cells, as did factors whose actions are mediated by cAMP, such as PTH and PTH-related peptide. This was true of control cells, as well as of dexamethasone- and phorbol ester-stimulated cells. Previously we have shown that type 1 cytokines as well as tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulate aromatase activity of adipose stromal cells in the presence of dexamethasone. By contrast, interleukin-6, interleukin-11, and leukemia-inhibitory factor had no effect on aromatase activity of THP-1 cells, whereas tumor necrosis factor-alpha, oncostatin M, and platelet-derived growth factor were slightly inhibitory of aromatase activity. Exon-specific Southern analysis of rapid amplification of cDNA ends-amplified transcripts was employed to examine the distribution of the various 5'-termini of aromatase transcripts. In the control group, most of the clones contained transcripts specific for the proximal promoter II, whereas in dexamethasone-treated cells, most transcripts contained exon I.4. In the phorbol ester-treated cells, a broader spectrum of transcripts was present, with equal proportions of I.4, II, and I.3-containing clones. Additionally, one clone containing a new sequence, exon I.6, was found. This was shown to be located about 1 kb upstream of exon II. By contrast, all clones from cells treated with (Bu)2cAMP contained promoter II-specific sequences. In addition to these transcripts, two clones in the library from the dexamethasone-treated cells contained the sequence previously defined as the brain-specific sequence, 1f. In one of these, the 1f sequence was fused downstream of exon I.4, indicative that its expression likely employed promoter I.4. These results point to similarities and important differences between aromatase expression in THP-1 cells and other cells such as adipose stromal cells, indicative of unique regulatory pathways governing aromatase expression in these cells.","['Cecil H. and Ida Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9051, USA.']",,['R37AG08174/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is possible that the lineage switch and development of myelodysplasia in this case may have been secondary to treatment, but persistence of the original cytogenetic clone makes this unlikely. This may have been the result of some unusual effect of the treatment on the original clone, or expansion of a small unidentified myeloid clone present originally which gained a proliferative advantage due to the ALL-type treatment.

We have therefore checked CD34 positive hematopoietic stem cells and their normal and malignant descendants for HMGI-C expression. CD34 positive stem cells from healthy donors and the leukemia samples tested were positive while all peripheral blood samples from healthy volunteers were negative. We have concluded that the expression of the HMGI-C gene in leukemia seems to be a secondary effect due to abnormal stem cell proliferation and might be a sensitive tumor marker for particular types of leukemia.","['Center of Human Genetics and Genetic Counseling, University of Bremen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We treated 18 children with relapsed AML on two separate protocols that included continuous infusion (CI) of cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) (total dose 4gr-6gr/m2) over 96-120 hours. In an attempt to increase the fraction of blasts in S-phase and render them more sensitive to cell-cycle specific agents such as ara-C, 10 patients received 5mcg/kg rhG-CSF twice daily beginning 48 hours before and continuing through the duration of the CI ara-C (POG #9192 study). The percentage of cells is S phase before and after G-CSF administration was determined. In a second group of patients (n = 8) who received ara-C alone, endogenous concentrations of G-CSF and serial blood counts were measured (St Jude's R4 study). The rationale of the St Jude's R4 was to optimize the schedule of the second course of ara-C at a time when the patient's endogenous G-CSF concentration was increased and thus maximize the percent of cells captured in S phase. Four out of 8 patients receiving CI ara-C alone and 4 out of 10 patients receiving CI ara-C with rhG-CSF achieved a complete remission (CR) after 1 cycle of therapy. Four patients in CR underwent marrow transplantation (2 allogeneic and 2 autologous). Cell cycle analysis of blast cells cultured in vitro with or without G-CSF showed a two fold increase in the percentage of cells in S phase (P = 0.03) whereas cells obtained from patients before and after G-CSF administration showed no difference in cell cycling. Correlation between G-CSF concentrations and ANC showed a negative association indicating that the regulatory mechanisms for G-CSF production remained intact. In our relatively small series, CI ara-C achieved a CR rate of 44% with rhG-CSF having no effect on the remission rate. Although in vitro rhG-CSF increased the percentage of blasts in S phase significantly, in vivo effects were not observed. Larger studies with combinations of different hematopoietic growth factors and cell-cycle active drugs are needed to evaluate the role of these cytokines in the therapy of recurrent AML.","['Pediatric Oncology Group, Chicago, IL, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This maturation arrest can be reversed by differentiation agents such as antitumor drugs currently used in conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. In this respect, anthracyclines have been shown to trigger the differentiation of leukemic and solid tumor cells, but the molecular mechanisms by which such drugs lead to the differentiating phenotype are still poorly understood. Using human leukemic multipotent K562 cells, we have demonstrated that subtoxic concentrations of aclacinomycin (ACLA) and doxorubicin (DOX) preferentially stimulate the hemoglobinic pathway (globins and heme synthesis) and the expression of mRNAs of globins and of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). However, our results indicate that both drugs exert this differentiating effect along distinct regulatory pathways. Indeed, only ACLA and not DOX induces the expression of erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) mRNAs and of membrane EpoR, as well as an overexpression of the erythroid transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2 known to play a central role in erythroid gene regulation. Similarly, using transfection assays, ACLA but not DOX activates the regulatory regions (promoters and enhancers) of GATA-1, EpoR, PBGD, epsilon- and gamma-globin genes. Finally, results of run-on assays indicate that ACLA induces an enhancement of the transcription rate of these erythroid genes whereas DOX preferentially increases stability of GATA-1, NF-E2 and PBGD mRNAs. In conclusion, ACLA mainly acts at the transcriptional level via specific activation of erythroid regulatory regions whereas DOX rather acts at the posttranscriptional level by increasing the half-lives of erythroid mRNAs.","['Laboratoire de Biochimie, GIBSA, Faculte de Pharmacie, Reims, France.']",,,67,,,,,,,,,,,,

We first evaluated the proliferative response of 3 leukemic cell lines and 32 primary samples from AML patients to IL-9 alone and combined with rh-IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF, c-kit ligand). The colony forming ability of leukemic cells was assessed by a clonogenic assay in methylcellulose, whereas the cell cycle characteristics of the same samples were determined by the acridine-orange (AO) flow cytometric technique and the bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) incorporation assay. In addition, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase Assay (TDTA) and standard analysis of DNA cleavage by gel electrophoresis were used to evaluate induction or prevention of apoptosis by IL-9. IL-9, used as a single cytokine, at various concentrations stimulated the colony formation of the 3 myeloid cell lines under serum-containing and serum-free conditions and this effect was completely abrogated by anti-IL-9 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). When tested on fresh AML samples, optimal concentrations of IL-9 resulted in the increase of the blast colony formation in all the cases studied and was the most effective CSF for promoting leukemic cell growth among those tested in this study including SCF, IL-3, and GM-CSF. The addition of SCF to IL-9 demonstrated an additive or synergistic effect of the 2 cytokines in 5 out of 8 AML cases tested for their CFU-L growth (187 +/- 79 colonies in comparison with 107 +/- 32 CFU-L; p = 0.05). Positive interaction was also observed when IL-9 was combined with IL-3 and GM-CSF. Studies of cell cycle distribution of AML samples demonstrated that IL-9 alone significantly augmented the number of leukemic cells in S-phase in the majority of the cases evaluated. IL-9 and SCF in combination resulted in a remarkable decrease of the G0 cell fraction (38.2 +/- 24% compared to 58.6 +/- 22% of control cultures; p < 0.05) and induced an increase of G1 and S-phase cells. Conversely, neither IL-9 alone nor the combination of IL-9 and SCF had any effect on induction or prevention of apoptosis of leukemic cells. Furthermore, in this study, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR) did not show the constitutive expression of IL-9 mRNA in the cell lines and the AML samples studied at diagnosis. In summary, IL-9 may play a role in the development of acute myeloid leukemia by stimulating the proliferation of leukemic cells perhaps through a paracrine growth loop.","['Institute of Hematology, University of Bologna, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein tyrosine kinase assays detected a catalytic active form of p56lck in all p56lck expressing samples. Stimulation experiments of the different cell lines and primary tumour cells by the phorbol ester TPA and the B-cell specific stimulation with SAC/anti-IgM respectively indicated a change of the expression level in comparison with the unstimulated cells and, a higher molecular weight species of the protein tyrosine kinase p56lck was observed. This was probably due to hyperphosphorylation of p56lck. No correlation between an infection with the Epstein-Barr virus and the expression of p56lck was found in the cell lines used and in primary tumour cells. Inhibition of p56lck activity by the specific inhibitor 4-amino-6-hydroxyflavone revealed a decrease of proliferation of the T-cell line Jurkat, but not of the Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. In the analysed cell lines we found a reduction of the kinase activity of p56lck of approximately 70%.

However, the precise mechanism of leukemogenesis remains unclear. Primary ATL cells demonstrate autonomous and IL-2 responsive growth in vitro. The autonomous growth of the cells is thought to be mediated by IL-2 in an autocrine manner, at least in part. These growth activities are related inversely to survival, and may be useful prognostic determinants. The viral Tax protein stimulates IL-2 and IL-2 receptor alpha expression via nuclear transfer factor NF-kappaB induction. We showed that marked activation of the Tax-NF-kappaB pathway is seen only in acute-type ATL patients. Recent studies show that mutations of p16 and p53 are also found in acute and lymphoma-type ATL. These appear to be late events in ATL leukemogenesis. The relationship between activation of Tax-NF-kappaB pathway and mutations of p53 and p16 genes is unknown. A few other genetic events may be involved in earlier stages of the entire process of ATL leukemogenesis, leading to smoldering and chronic-type ATL. These gene mutations may be accumulated by Tax protein during the long process from the time of HTLV-I infection to the onset of ATL.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hazards of graft rejection and a higher relapse rate can be avoided by maintaining a portion of the T-cells in the graft. The positive selection of CD34+ cells from peripheral blood preparations simultaneously provides an approximately 1000-fold reduction of T-cells. These purified CD34+ cells containing committed and pluripotent stem cells are suitable for allogeneic transplantation and can be used in the following instances: 1. As hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell transplantation instead of bone marrow cells, from HLA-identical family donors; 2. for increasing the stem cell numbers from HLA-mismatched or three HLA-loci different family donors in order to reduce the incidence of rejection but without increasing the T-cell number; 3. boosting of poor marrow graft function with stem cells from the same family donors; 4. transplantation from volunteer matched unrelated donors; 5. split transplantation of CD34+ and T-cells; 6. addition of ex vivo expanded CD34+ cells to blood cell or bone marrow transplantation; 7. generation of antigen specific immune effector cells and antigen presenting cells for cell therapy.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology Medical School Hannover, Germany.

Cells from 31 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were treated in vitro with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA), arabinosyl-2-fluoroadenine (F-ara-A), or chlorambucil (CLB) and drug sensitivity measured using the MTT assay. The protein levels of bax and bcl-2 were measured in CLL cells from 25 patients, and were found to be higher in leukemic cells than in normal B cells. The bcl-2 levels varied three-fold, the bax levels fifteen-fold, and the bax:bcl-2 ratios ranged from 0.44 to 2.91. The expression of mdm-2 mRNA was measured in CLL cells from 28 patients and was found to vary twenty-fold. However, no correlation was observed between drug sensitivity to CdA, F-ara-A, or CLB and the cellular levels of mdm-2 mRNA, or the protein levels of bax or bcl-2, or the bax:bcl-2 ratio. Treatment of CLL cells having wild type p53 with CdA, F-ara-A or CLB produced an increase in p53 protein and mdm-2 mRNA. This was not observed in cells having a p53 mutation, and these cells were highly resistant to both CLB and the nucleoside analogs. In contrast to the nucleoside analogs and CLB, dexamethasone and vincristine had no effect on mdm-2 mRNA levels. Treatment of CLL cells containing a wild type p53 gene with CdA, F-ara-A, or CLB, did not produce any consistent changes in bax or bcl-2. Thus, CdA, F-ara-A and CLB appear to act in CLL cells through a p53-dependent pathway, whereas this does not occur with dexamethasone or vincristine. The cellular levels of mdm-2, bcl-2, bax or the bax:bcl-2 ratios are not predictive indicators of clinical sensitivity in CLL, but an increase in mdm-2 levels after drug treatment is indicative of p53 function in these cells.","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-1-alpha mRNA is also expressed in fresh leukemic cells of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) patients. HTLV-I-induced IL-1 alpha might explain some symptoms observed in ATLL.

Incorporation of Vpr in the virion was reported to be mediated by the C-terminal domain of the Pr55(Gag) polyprotein precursor, which includes NCp7, a protein involved in the genomic RNA encapsidation and p6, a protein required for particle budding. To precisely define the Gag and Vpr sequences involved in this protein-protein interaction, NCp7, p6, and Vpr as well as a series of derived peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Binding assays were carried out by Far Western experiments and by competition studies using (52-96)Vpr immobilized onto agarose beads. The results show that interaction between NCp7 and Vpr occurs in vitro by a recognition mechanism requiring the zinc fingers of NCp7 and the last 16 amino acids of Vpr. Moreover, NCp10, the equivalent of NCp7 in Moloney murine leukemia virus but not polysine inhibits Vpr-NCp7 complexation. Interestingly enough, Vpr was found to interact with Gag, NCp15, and NCp7 but not with mature p6 in vitro. In vivo mutations in NCp7 zinc fingers in an HIV-1 molecular clone led to viruses with important defects in Vpr encapsidation. Together, these results suggest that NCp7 cooperates with p6 to induce Vpr encapsidation in HIV-1 mature particles. The NCp7-Vpr complex could also be important for interaction of Vpr with cellular proteins involved in cell division.","['Departement de Pharmacochimie Moleculaire et Structurale, INSERM U266, CNRS URA D 1500, UFR des Sciences Pharmaceutiques et Biologiques, 75270 Paris Cedex 06, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These proteins are antioxidants that function as peroxidases only when coupled to a sulfhydryl reducing system. The physiological function of TPx in cells is not yet known. Here we demonstrate that when the human TPx II, a member of this family, is stably overexpressed in Molt-4 leukemia cells, it protects from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation, ceramide, or etoposide. TPx II, like Bcl-2, is able to inhibit release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol, and it inhibits lipid peroxidation in cells. TPx II, unlike Bcl-2, could prevent hydrogen peroxide accumulation in cells, suggesting that it functions upstream of Bcl-2 in the protection from apoptosis and may be implicated as an endogenous regulator of apoptosis.","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",,['1R29-AG-12467/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although highly efficacious in destroying the malignant B-cells, fludarabine also causes T-cell lymphopenia and immunosuppression. We present five patients given fludarabine for low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders who showed transformation of the primary neoplasm to a higher grade tumor. Immunohistologic antibody studies were performed on paraffin-embedded tissue sections of the initial tissue (when available) and on the follow-up biopsy specimens for CD20, CD3, CD45RO, CD43, CD30, CD15, and latent membrane protein (LMP-1) for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The initial diagnoses in these five patients included chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (three cases), follicle center lymphoma (one case), and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (one case). All of the follow-up biopsy specimens showed scattered Hodgkin's-like cells, and two of the five also showed foci of large-cell transformation. The Hodgkin's-like cells showed CD30 immunoreactivity in four of the five cases and CD15 immunoreactivity in three of the five. Strong immunoreactivity of the large, atypical, Hodgkin's-like cells for LMP-1 of EBV was noted in four cases; in the remaining case, this finding was equivocal. In situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA was positive in four of the five cases. Molecular studies by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed the presence of EBV in three of the five cases. PCR for detection of immunoglobulin heavy chain demonstrated identical monoclonal rearrangements in the original lymphoma and transformation in one case with available material. The CD4 lymphocyte count in each patient was less than 550/microL, indicating cellular dysfunction. Transformation of low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas after fludarabine therapy might be associated with EBV and severe immunosuppression.","['Department of Pathology, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, D.C., USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular structure of mucin core peptide (apomucin) was identified recently. However, the function of apomucin is only poorly understood. To further elucidate the role of apomucin in the modulation of cancers, this study was to investigate the immune responses induced by mucin core peptide in mice. The mucin core peptide was isolated from pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990. When mice immunized with this apomucin (10 micrograms/time x 6) plus DETOX, all mice developed delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) after challanged with apomucin or synthetic mucin core peptide MUC-2 or MUC-3, while the mice immunized with only apomucin did not develop DTH. No antibodies were detected by ELISA after immunization. When the splenic cells of vaccinated mice were cocultured with this apomucin (10-50 micrograms/ml) and rhIL-2 (50 U/ml) in vitro, the proliferated lymphocytes showed cytotoxicity against human cancer cells, including colon cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer and leukemia as measured by Cr-51 release assay. The cytotoxicity could be blocked by antibodies against MUC-2 and MUC-3. These results provide a rational basis for the use of apomucin as a vaccine to stimulate anti-tumor immunity.","['General Hospital of PLA, Cancer Research Laboratory, Beijing.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This novel antineoplastic agent has been demonstrated to have substantial clinical activity against various tumors. In this paper, the mechanisms of antitumor activity of elemene are reported. The in vitro effect of elemene on the growth of leukemia cells was evaluated by MTT assay. The IC50 values of elemene for promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells and erythroleukemia K562 cells were found to be 27.5 micrograms/ml and 81 micrograms/ml, respectively, while IC50 for peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) was 254.3 micrograms/ml. The inhibitory effect of elemene on proliferation of HL-60 cells was associated with cell cycle arrest from, S to G2M phase transition and with induction of apoptosis. The apoptosis of tumor cells was confirmed by DNA ladder formation on gel electrophoresis and characteristic ultrastructural alternations. These results indicate that induction of apoptosis contributes to the mechanisms for antitumor activity of elemene.","['Cancer Institute, Zhejiang Medical University, Hangzhou.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are characterized, respectively, by excessive thrombocytosis and erythrocytosis, a high incidence of thrombohemorrhagic events, vasomotor symptoms, and an inherent tendency to undergo leukemic transformation. Current standard therapies to control the excess accumulation of myeloid cells and to provide symptomatic relief carry either a persistent risk of thrombosis, as in the case of phlebotomy, or, in the case of hydroxyurea, the potential for inducing leukemia. None alter the natural history of these diseases. Interferon-alpha has been shown to have potent antiproliferative effects on the hematopoietic stem cells and bone marrow fibroblasts and, as a result, has received much attention as a therapeutic agent for chronic myeloproliferative disorders. The ability of interferon-alpha to induce hematologic and cytogenetic remission in chronic phase chronic granulocytic leukemia has further increased interest in this agent. Interferon-alpha has shown therapeutic activity in PV and ET, as demonstrated in multiple small studies and single-arm trials reviewed in this article. Reported beneficial effects include the ability to control excessive erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis and such disease-related features as vasomotor symptoms, pruritus, and splenomegaly. Recent reports of cytogenetic remission and reversal of bone marrow fibrosis after interferon therapy are of interest. Advantages over current therapeutic standards include lack of known leukemogenic and teratogenic effects and the potential to alter the underlying course of disease. Nevertheless, none of the information available allows definite therapeutic recommendations for the use of interferon-alpha in PV or ET. The available data support the need for randomized controlled trials comparing interferon-alpha with standard therapy.","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",,,96,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with reactive thrombocytosis exhibit a similar reduction in large vWf multimers in plasma, but their clinical course is usually not complicated by bleeding, probably as a consequence of increased circulating vWf levels due to the behavior of vWf as a reactive protein, which compensates for the relatively decreased levels of large vWf multimers in plasma.","['Blood Coagulation Laboratory, Lab.

METHODS: Nineteen patients with hematologic malignancy, in whom invasive pulmonary aspergillosis developed during the course of neutropenia, had operations. Neutropenia lasted 28 days (range, 15 to 45 days). The preoperative diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was based on computed tomographic scan findings (halo or air crescent signs). RESULTS: Eight patients underwent emergency operations, before marrow recovery, for prevention of massive hemoptysis. The criterion for operation was an aspergillosis lesion that contacted the pulmonary artery on computed tomography. A lobectomy was performed in all cases. A sleeve resection of the pulmonary artery was necessary on two occasions. There was one postoperative death due to extensive aspergillosis. The length of hospitalization after operation was 13 days (range, 6 to 18 days). Seven patients were treated by elective resection of a residual mass (before hematologic therapy in 6 cases). The types of resection performed were lobectomy (n = 4), lingulectomy (n = 1), and wedge resection (n = 2). There were no postoperative deaths. The average length of stay before discharge from the hospital was 11 days (range, 7 to 20 days). The surgical resection was performed as a diagnostic procedure in the 4 remaining patients after an allotted time of 14 days (range, 4 to 24 days) from initiation of antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of antifungal agents and surgical resection is an efficient strategy for the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with hematologic malignancy.","['Department of Surgery, University of Burgundy, Dijon, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development-National Cancer Institute-Children's Cancer Group Leukemia Follow-Up Study used a historical cohort design to investigate menarche in 188 ALL survivors who were premanarchal at diagnosis, aged at least 18 years, at least 2 years after diagnosis, alive, and in remission. Female siblings of ALL survivors (n = 218) served as control subjects. RESULTS: Menarche occurred within the normal age range in 92% of survivors and 96% of the control subjects (p = 0.09). Early menarche occurred in four survivors (2%) and three control subjects (1%). Delayed, absent, or medically induced menarche was reported by 12 survivors (6%) and six control subjects (3%). Compared with the control subjects, survivors of ALL who received 1800 cGy cranial radiation before the age of 8 years had significantly earlier menarche, relative hazard (RH) of 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 3.4 [p = 0.0003]). Survivors receiving 2400 cGy of craniospinal radiation with or without abdominal radiation had significantly later menarche than the control subjects, RH 0.4 (95% confidence interval: 0.3, 0.7 [p = 0.0002]). CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of ALL survivors, the risk of disordered menarche was low. However, younger subjects receiving 1800 cGy cranial radiation and those receiving 2400 cGy below the diaphragm required careful monitoring.","['Pediatric Epidemiology Section, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 05436/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This essay explores the many dimensions of quality in health care and shows that many understandings of it are narrowly configured to the agendas of the respective participants--providers, patients, and institutions--in today's health care arena. Also, there are many aspects of quality that defy measurement in the epidemiological sense. These are seen in the physician-patient relationship and in special clinical situations, such as the process of dying. Using the idea of quality to buttress ethical and policy decisions, particularly by managed care organizations, is often problematic, given this complexity. It is thus imperative that those so using quality be accountable that their understanding of it be arrived at by responsible means, that it addresses something meaningful, and that it not eclipse the many other dimensions of quality.","['Center for Biomedical Ethics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Template-based models of Fv (VL-VH) fragments were derived for the surface IgM expressed by the malignant CD5 positive B cells from three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). The conserved framework regions were constructed using crystal coordinates taken from highly homologous human variable domain structures (Pot and Hil). Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) were predicted by grafting loops, taken from known immunoglobulin structures, onto the Fv framework models. The CDR templates were chosen, where possible, to be of the same length and of high residue identity or similarity. LCDR1, 2 and 3 as well as HCDR1 and 2 for the Fv were constructed using this strategy. For HCDR3 prediction, a database containing the Cartesian coordinates of 30 of these loops was complied from unliganded antibody X-ray crystallographic structures and an HCDR3 of the same length as that of the B CLL Fv was selected as a template. In one case (Yar), the resulting HCDR3 model gave unfavourable interactions when incorporated into the Fv model. This HCDR3 was therefore modelled using an alternative strategy of construction of the loop stems, using a previously described HCDR3 conformation (Pot), followed by chain closure with a beta-turn. The template models were subjected to positional refinement using energy minimisation and molecular dynamics simulations (X-PLOR). An electrostatic surface description (GRASP) did not reveal a common structural feature within the binding sites of the three polyreactive Fv. Thus, polyreactive immunoglobulins may recognise similar and multiple antigens through a diverse array of binding site structures.","['Immunobiology Unit, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biological response to TNF requires interaction with specific cell membrane receptors. Extracellular domains of these receptors are released into body fluids as soluble molecules, and participate in the bioactivity of TNF. Serum levels of p55 and p75 soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors (sTNFR) were determined in 34 patients with different diseases who underwent BMT. Sequential studies initiated 10 days before BMT and continued up to 110 days post-transplantation showed that p55 and p75 sTNFR levels were elevated significantly in patients who subsequently developed major transplant-related complications (TRC). Moreover, both sTNFR levels were increased 2- to 3-fold over control values during post-BMT febrile periods in those patients who at a later stage suffered major TRC. These results indicate that the serum level of sTNFR may be used as a prognostic marker for major TRC in BMT.","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A potential risk of GF administration is a stimulatory signal on the leukemic population. In the present study we investigated the proliferative and programmed cell death (PCD) effect of two cytokines that have recently entered clinical use, stem cell factor (SCF) and the granulocyte colony stimulating factor/IL-3 fusion molecule (PIXY-321), on 14 ALL samples. The activity of IL-7, a cytokine involved in the regulation of ALL cell proliferation, was also tested alone and in combination with these two cytokines. Using the acridine orange flow cytometric technique and the clonogenic assay, we showed that none of these cytokines was capable of significantly increasing the mean percentage of S-phase cells and CFU-L number. A mean decrease of G0 cells from 60.6% to 52.6% (p = 0.02), coupled by a significant increase of G1 cells from 28.2% to 37.9% (p = 0.003) was demonstrated in the presence of PIXY-321. IL-7 alone and in combination with either PIXY-321 or SCF induced similar changes in the percentage of cells in G0 and G1. SCF showed no activity on G0 depletion. When each individual samples was analyzed separately, some heterogeneity was observed. An increase of S phase was recorded in a proportion of cases after SCF and PIXY-321 exposure. However, none of the cytokines evaluated by a clonogenic assay following liquid culture was capable of maintaining or promoting self-renewal of leukemic precursors, as determined by plating fresh cells at time 0. Detection of cytokine effects of apoptosis showed that SCF and PIXY-321 did not significantly reduce the mean percentage of cells in PCD, whereas a significant protective effect was observed in the presence of IL-7 (p = 0.02). We conclude that PIXY-321 and, to a further extent, SCF fail to induce leukemic lymphoid cell proliferation, and do not protect cells from entering apoptosis. These in vitro findings may be useful for ALL clinical trial design.","['Department of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza, Roma, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four cohorts of three patients were consecutively enrolled so that they received rh-IL-3 on days 9, 6, 3 and 1 after start of ATG/CSA treatment. Yeast-derived recombinant human IL-3 was administered by daily subcutaneous injection until day 90 at a dosage of 250 micrograms/m2. Long-term application of rh-IL-3 was well tolerated. The combination of rh-IL-3 with immunosuppression did not modify the known toxicities of ATG and CSA. Incidence and severity of rh-IL-3-related adverse events was less than in other phase I/II trials of rh-IL-3 as single-agent therapy. One might speculate that co-medication with CSA alleviates rh-IL-3-induced side effects. Three of eight patients with refractory AA and all four patients with relapsed AA responded to the combined treatment within four months. The median time to response was 91.5 days. There was evidence for an rh-IL-3-dependent response in two patients. Long-term rh-IL-3 did not cause stem cell exhaustion. One patient died early during the course of the study from EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disease. Two patients developed acute myeloid leukemia 4 and 22 months after cessation of rh-IL-3. In conclusion, long-term rh-IL-3 in combination with immunosuppression is well tolerated. The response rate to the combined treatment in refractory and relapsed AA was high. Recombinant human IL-3-dependent responses suggest efficacy. A prospective randomized trial comparing immunosuppression alone versus a combination with rh-IL-3 is warranted.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These vectors are able to infect many different cell types, and the retroviral promoter, which is often used to control the expression of a therapeutic gene, is active in a wide range of different cell types. Safe and efficient gene transfer systems, whether based upon retroviruses or other agents, should deliver beneficial genes only to cells that require their therapeutic action, and these genes ideally should be expressed exclusively in such cells. In this paper, strategies for redirecting the infection spectrum of retroviral vectors in order to obtain cell-targeted gene delivery are discussed. These strategies include the engineering of the retroviral envelope protein, which, together with the availability of its cognate receptor, determines infectivity, and the use of proteins from other enveloped viruses of both retroviral and nonretroviral origin in the cell lines used to produce retroviral vector virus particles. Expression targeting can be achieved by limiting the expression of therapeutic genes to the cell type(s) of interest using promoters from genes that are normally active in these cells. This approach to targeting is illustrated using promoters from genes expressed in either the liver, the pancreas or the mammary gland as a means to limit gene expression specifically to the cell types that make up these organs. The successful utilization of new generations of targeted retroviral vectors in the clinic may well pave the way for superior gene delivery systems of the future that seek out their target cell, delivering a therapeutic gene to and expressing it only in such cells.","['GSF-Forschungszentrum fur Umwelt und Gesundheit, Institut fur Molekulare Virologie, Neuherberg, Germany.']",,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, the blasts of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) proliferate under the influence of certain positive and negative regulators (cytokines). We conducted this study to determine whether cytokines could induce markers of cell death (FAS/Apo-1/CD95), of cell activation (HLA-DR) and cell adhesion (ICAM-1, CD54) in AML cell lines and primary AML samples. As inducers, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma were chosen. At baseline, CD95 and CD54 were weakly and HLA-DR was strongly expressed. CD95 was induced by TNF in 6/12 myeloid leukemia cell lines, and by IFN in 9/12 cell lines. Taken together, CD95 was upregulated by at least one cytokine in 11/12 cell lines. HLA-DR was inducible in 10/12 cell lines, with IFN being more potent than TNF. CD54 showed the strongest induction: TNF resulted in a more than 20-fold induction in positive cell lines, and IFN resulted in a more than 20-fold induction. In primary AML samples, CD95 was induced in 14/14 samples examined, with TNF being more potent than IFN. HLA-DR expression was increased by IFN in 12/15 samples and by TNF in 11/13 samples. The inducibility of HLA-DR by IFN was inversely correlated with baseline expression. As in the cell lines, CD54 was induced in most cases of AML. In addition to the induction of surface markers by cytokines, the culture of leukemia cells with fetal calf serum increased the expression of these markers, especially CD95 and CD54. Our results demonstrate that CD95 is not downregulated when TNF binds to its receptors, but is induced in cell lines and patient samples. Despite the induction of expression of CD95 (all cases of AML and most cell lines), 7/8 myelogenous leukemia lines and 6/7 patient samples remained resistant to CD95 triggering by antibody or by CD95 ligand, which suggests a lesion in normal cell signaling. As a positive control, a T-cell line (Jurkat) with 60% to > 90% apoptotic cells after a 22 h incubation was used. The number of CD95-binding sites was not correlated with the induction of apoptosis. The resistance of most cases of AML to CD95 triggering despite inducible expression may also be related to leukemia-specific antagonists of CD95 signal transduction, and requires further investigation. Altogether, our results indicate that surface markers related to apoptosis, activation and adhesion can be induced on AML blasts, and could be relevant to treatment strategies that exploit ligand binding to these surface epitopes.","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",,"['CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 57639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, two main techniques are being introduced for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in leukemia, namely immunological marker analysis and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique with general sensitivity of 10(-4)-10(-5). Immunological marker analysis allows detection of unusual and aberrant immunophenotypes, and is usually performed by flow cytometry. PCR analysis allows detection of leukemia-specific DNA sequences, such as fusion regions of chromosome aberrations and junctional regions of rearranged immunoglogulin (Ig) genes and T-cell receptor (TcR) genes. The applicability of the immunophenotyping and PCR-mediated MRD techniques is dependent on the type of leukemia. In virtually all acute lymphoblastic leukemias, PCR analysis of Ig and TcR genes can be used, and immunophenotypic MRD detection is also possible in 70-80% of cases. In AML, immunophenotypic MRD detection can be applied in approximately 80% of cases and PCR analysis of chromosome aberrations in 25-40%. Each MRD technique has its advantages and limitations, which have to be weighed carefully to make an appropriate choice.

Both IL-1 genes, IL-1 alpha and the prominent IL-1 beta, produce 31 kDa proteins. Whereas the precursor (pro) 31 kDa form of IL-1 alpha is biologically active, pro-IL-1 beta is inactive unless cleaved to its mature form by a cytoplasmic cysteine protease termed IL-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE). Although ICE was first thought to be a unique enzyme with a single biologic activity, several investigators have demonstrated that ICE shares sequence homology with the protein product of ced-3, the gene for cell death of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and can induce apoptosis in different cellular systems. However, recent data indicate that ICE is a member of an increasingly recognized family of ICE-related molecules whose other members, such as CPP32, do not cleave pro-IL-1 beta but rather are effective inducers of apoptotic cell death. We recently investigated the effect of ICE inhibition on acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) colony growth. We found that inhibition of ICE reduced the production of mature IL-1 beta and suppressed the proliferation of AML colony-forming units, confirming the central role of IL-1 beta in AML progenitor proliferation. These data suggest that the primary role of ICE in AML cells is cleavage of pro-IL-1 beta rather than induction of apoptosis and that the antileukemic activity of specific ICE inhibitors warrants further exploitation.","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",,,130,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several biological parameters were monitored on the blast population: multidrug resistance (MDR) functional expression by rhodamine-123 efflux (Rhd-E), cell cycle changes, induction of apoptosis and leukemic clonogenic cell growth (CFU-L). The mean basal Rhd-E value was 14.4% (range 0-51.2), and 12/14 patients exhibited a dye efflux > 4%, efficiently blocked by the MDR-reversal agent cyclosporin A. After 24 h of G-CSF administration, cell cycle studies showed in bone marrow (BM) samples a significant mean increase in S phase (p = 0.04) and in RNA content of G1 cells (p = 0.01), coupled to a significant increase in apoptosis (p = 0.02). Clonogenic cell growth analysis showed a twofold increase in BM CFU-L in 6 of the 14 cases tested. When G-CSF activity was assessed without the addition of exogenous growth factors (autonomous proliferation), a significant increase (p = 0.02) in CFU-L was found only in patients who achieved a complete remission (CR); these patients were also characterized by lower S-phase values at diagnosis. Eight of the 14 patients treated achieved CR, but the median response duration was three months, and only two cases are still in CR. The FLAG regimen can thus induce remission in poor risk AML patients. The responses, however, are short, suggesting that resistant cells are not efficiently affected by either the use of agents not involved in the MDR-efflux mechanism or by the G-CSF priming strategy. Other post-induction therapies need to be considered in further approaches.","['Department of Human Biopathology, Universita di Roma La Sapienza, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constitutive expression of IFNcon1 reverted the malignant phenotype, as indicated by loss of tumorgenicity in nude mice. When stably transformed cells were mixed with parental tumor cells, there was retardation of tumor growth. Constitutive expression of IFNcon1 reverted the malignant phenotype in vitro, as indicated by growth inhibition in culture, and reduction in colony formation on soft agar. Furthermore, IFNcon1 gene expression resulted in elevated erythroid differentiation, growth arrest in S phase and induced apoptosis. Thus the presence of an active IFNcon1 gene overcomes the oncogenic potential of K562 by coordinated modulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and programmed cell death, and it acts as a tumor suppressor in vivo.","['Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington 47405, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD34-positive cells were cultured for seven days in the presence of optimal concentrations of appropriate growth factors. At day 7 of culture both S-phase fraction and differentiation were identical in normal and leukemic cells. In normal cells the proportion of S-phase cells was reduced by irradiation with 500 rad from 40 +/- 3% to 16 +/- 2%. In contrast, in CML cells a reduction of S-phase cells from 35 +/- 2% to 25 +/- 3% was observed. Moreover, irradiated CML cells arrested at a smaller number of cells in G2. Similarly, a significantly higher proportion of CML cells remained in S phase after withdrawal of growth factors. Semiquantitative PCR of p21 (waf1/cip1) induction by gamma irradiation provided no evidence for a major functional deficiency of p53 response to irradiation in these cells. Our results demonstrate an abnormal cell cycle arrest in chronic-phase CML cells both after gamma irradiation and after growth factor removal. This observation might have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of both hyperplasia of chronic phase and the development of blast crisis in CML.

Recently, a series of both specific and nonspecific IL-1 inhibitory molecules have been identified. These include IL-1 receptor antagonist, soluble IL-1 receptors, IL-1-converting enzyme inhibitor, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-1-antisense. Early experiments demonstrating the ability of some of these molecules to inhibit acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia growth suggest that clinical trials of these compounds may provide a novel management approach in these malignancies.

However, the probability of continued CR was low (e.g. 452 +/- 0.08 at 12 months), and the only patients alive in CR beyond two years were patients under age 60 without -5/-7 and with RAEB-t. Survival probability was 0.35 +/- 0.05 at one year. Eight of 56 patients died in CR. While current AML-type chemotherapy can produce higher CR rates than is perhaps usually appreciated, in some patients with RAEB or RAEB-t (e.g. older patients with -5/-7) the brevity of the remissions and the risk entailed suggest that new post-remission therapies are needed to make this approach generally worthwhile.","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",,['CA 5516401 A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) is the natural ligand for the P2Z receptor of human lymphocytes it is less potent than 3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP) in opening the associated ion channel, which conducts a range of permeants including Ba2+ and ethidium+. We have quantified the influx of ethidium+ into lymphocytes produced by BzATP, ATP, 2-methylthio-ATP (2MeSATP) and ATPgammaS, studied competition between ATP and BzATP and investigated the effects of KN-62, a new and potent inhibitor of the P2Z receptor. 2. BzATP and ATP stimulated ethidium+ influx with EC50 values of 15.4+/-1.4 microM (n=5) and 85.6+/-8.8 microM (n=5), respectively. The maximal response to ATP was only 69.8+/-1.9% of that for BzATP. Hill analysis gave nH of 3.17+/-0.24 (n=3) and 2.09+/-0.45 (n=4) for BzATP and ATP, suggesting greater positive cooperativity for BzATP than for ATP in opening the P2Z receptor-operated ion channel. 3. A rank order of agonist potency of BzATP>ATP=2MeSATP>ATPgammaS was observed for agonist-stimulated ethidium+ influx, while maximal influxes followed a rank order of BzATP>ATP>2MeSATP>ATPgammaS. 4. Preincubation with 30-50 microM oxidized ATP (ox-ATP), an irreversible P2Z inhibitor, reduced the maximal response but did not change the steepness of the Ba2+ influx-response curve produced by BzATP (nH 3.2 and 2.9 for 30 and 50 microM ox-ATP, respectively (n=2)). 5. ATP (300-1000 microM) added simultaneously with 30 microM BzATP (EC90) inhibited both ethidium+ and Ba2+ fluxes to a maximum of 30-40% relative to the values observed with BzATP alone. Moreover, ATP (300 microM) shifted the concentration-response curve to the right for BzATP-stimulated Ba2+ influx, confirming competition between ATP and BzATP. 6. KN-62, a new and powerful inhibitor of the lymphocyte P2Z receptor, showed less potency in antagonizing BzATP-mediated fluxes than ATP-induced fluxes when maximal concentrations of both agonists (BzATP, 50 microM; ATP, 500 microM) were used. 7. These data suggest that the natural ligand, ATP, is a partial agonist for the P2Z receptor while BzATP is a more efficacious agonist. Moreover the competitive studies show that only a single class of P2-receptor (P2Z class) is expressed on human leukaemic lymphocytes.","['Department of Haematology, Austin Campus, Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre, Heidelberg, Vic, Australia.']",,,,,PMC1565004,,,,,,,,,,

Its antileukaemic effect can be related to drug derived 6-thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs). The inherited level of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity may be a major factor in the clinical response to 6MP because TPMT forms methylmercaptopurine metabolites (MeMPs) at the expense of TGNs. The aim of this study was to explore the clinical importance of TPMT phenotype. METHODS: Thiopurine metabolism was studied in a consecutive cohort of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated according to the Medical Research Council trial UK ALL XI. TPMT phenotype was measured in 38 children at diagnosis, and thiopurine metabolites were measured at defined times during 2 years treatment in 29 of these children. RESULTS: TPMT activities at diagnosis ranged from 5.5 to 18.5 units ml(-1) packed RBCs, no different from the range of activities reported in healthy children. TGNs and MeMPs measured during the first 6MP cycle at 75 mg m(-2) ranged from 187 to 594 pmol 6TGNs, median 327, and 0.5 to 22.0 nmol MeMPs, median 4.5, per 8 x 10(8) RBCs. TPMT activity was not significantly related to the generation of MeMPs (r(s) = 0.06), but was negatively correlated to 6TGNs (r(s) = -0.44, P<0.025, n=29). TGNs were related to neutropenia at the point of dose reduction (r(s) = -0.5, P<0.01).

Questions abound regarding the mechanism of action of these compounds, their reliability and their ultimate utility. These problems are compounded by the 'hype', which has attended their development, and the inability of workers in this area to meet the expectations raised by its most zealous proponents. Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that there have been some notable gene disruption successes with this technique that have stood up to rigorous scrutiny. Our own work with c-myb as a target is perhaps a reasonable example. Though much remains to be accomplished before antisense drugs are commonly, and usefully, employed in the clinic, it is important to remember what motivates their development. Gene-targeted drugs have the promise of exquisite specificity and the potential to do much good with little toxicity. Accordingly, antisense oligonucleotides can serve as a paradigm of rational drug development. For all these reasons then, we believe that efforts should be increased to decipher the mechanism of action of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, and to learn how they may be successfully employed in the clinic.","['Department of Pathology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purity of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides synthesized on Tentagel is significantly higher than those synthesized on controlled pore glass. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of the n-1 impurity isolated by preparative PAGE was used to establish that the n-1 impurity is a heterogeneous mixture of all possible single-deletion sequences, relative to the parent phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide, and results from minor, though repetitive, imperfections in the synthesis cycle. Acid-catalysed depurination was found to occur both during the synthesis and during the post-synthesis detritylation, following RP-HPLC. Studies of hybridization affinity and biological mechanism of action using independently synthesized n-1 phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides relative to the 15 mer LR-3280 showed that, in this case, the majority of the n-1 sequences had more than a 10 degrees C decrease in melting temperature with sense RNA compared to the n-mer, and they did not cause detectable cleavage of RNA by RNase H in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukaemia cells.

CD34+ cells were positively selected from PBPC using immunoaffinity columns. She received 8.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg and 1.74 x 10(6) CD3+ cells/kg body weight (BW). The patient developed acute GVHD III and mild limited chronic GVHD. Thirteen months after transplantation severe thyrotoxicosis requiring plasmapheresis occurred. Immune thyroiditis was confirmed cytologically by lymphocytic infiltration in a fine needle aspirate and by elevated thyroid-Ab-titers. The patient's donor had received thyroid hormone substitution for 10 years for hypothyroidism. The most probable cause of immune thyroiditis after allogeneic BMT is the transfer of antithyroid donor lymphocytes. These lymphocytes can also be transferred with a CD34+ selected peripheral stem cell graft. The transplantation of lymphocyte-depleted autologous bone marrow or PBPC grafts after myeloablative treatment is increasingly considered as potential treatment of severe autoimmune diseases. This case demonstrates that even low numbers of lymphocytes are capable of transferring autoimmune disorders.,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MLV-related viruses possess a long and multifunctional 5' untranslated leader involved in key steps of the viral life cycle--splicing, translation, RNA dimerization, encapsidation, and reverse transcription. Recent studies have shown that the 5' leader of Friend murine leukemia virus and Moloney murine leukemia virus can direct cap independent translation of gag precursor proteins (Berlioz et al., 1995; Vagner et al., 1995b). These data, together with structural homology studies (Koning et al., 1992), prompted us to undertake a search for new internal ribosome entry segment (IRES) of retroviral origin. Here we describe an IRES element within the 5' leader of avian reticuloendotheliosis virus type A (REV-A) genomic RNA. Data show that the REV-A 5' IRES element maps downstream of the packaging/dimerization (E/DLS) sequence (Watanabe and Temin, 1982; Darlix et al., 1992) and the minimal IRES sequence appears to be within a 129 nt fragment (nucleotides 452-580) of the 5' leader, immediately upstream of the gag AUG codon. The REV-A IRES has been successfully utilized in the construction of novel high titer MLV-based retroviral vectors, containing one or more IRES elements of retroviral origin. These retroviral constructs, which represent a starting point for the design of novel vectors suitable for gene therapy, are also of interest as a model system of internal translation initiation and its possible regulation during development, cancer, or virus infection.","['LaboRetro, Unite de Virologie Humaine INSERM U412, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using a retroviral vector, mouse GM-CSF cDNA was transduced into a highly tumorigenic T leukemia cell line, RL male 1. Injection of GM-CSF-secreting RL male 1 cells into syngeneic BALB/c mice elicited protective immunity in the animals, which could regress preestablished tumors introduced either by a subcutaneous or in an intravenous route. However, the therapeutic effects were less prominent in the mice inoculated with a large tumor load or in mice treated later. Winn tests further demonstrated that the splenocytes from the late-treated group conferred poorer protective effects in terms of reducing the growth of parental RL male 1 cells in naive mice than the splenocytes from the early-treated group. Nonetheless, upon stimulation in vitro, the activity of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) was comparable in the splenocytes of both groups of mice. Histological analysis also indicated that the CD8+ T cells appeared as early as 3 days following vaccination at the vaccine sites and at the tumor sites in both groups of mice. Above observations implied that the T cells in the animals bearing large tumors appeared to be in a state of suppression or anergy. Systematic histological analyses for 2 weeks provided further insight into various infiltrates at the vaccine sites and at the tumor sites in response to the inoculation of GM-CSF-secreting tumor vaccine.","['Graduate Institute of Microbiology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This receptor, called Ig-like transcript (ILT)2, binds MHC class I molecules and delivers a negative signal that inhibits killing by NK and T cells, as well as Ca2+ mobilization in B cells and myelomonocytic cells triggered through the B cell antigen receptor and human histocompatibility leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DR, respectively. In addition, myelomonocytic cells express receptors homologous to ILT2, which are characterized by extensive polymorphism and might recognize distinct HLA class I molecules.

On the other hand a significant number of the children are not cured despite intensive treatment. At the same time some highly curable patients are treated too intensively and suffer from unnecessary side effects of the chemo- and radiotherapy applied. In order to further improve the therapeutic results in this disease, we have to distinguish between the cases with a better and a worse prognosis. The initial karyotype (both numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities) proved to be one of the most reliable prognostic parameters, leading to the suggestion of developing genotype-specific therapies. Although the prognosis in patients with pseudodiploid karyotype is usually unfavorable, a significantly better prognosis can be observed in those with more than 50 chromosomes. Because the latter patients can achieve remission on a metabolite-based therapy, the toxic effects of more aggressive chemotherapy with anthracyclines and genotoxic agents can be avoided; thus, the reliable and accurate identification of patients with > 50 chromosomes is of particular importance. For this purpose three methods: chromosome analysis, DNA flow cytometry, and fluorescence in situ hybridization can be used. In 1993 it was decided to develop a comprehensive nationwide project in order to perform the initial genetic analysis of all ALL children diagnosed in the hematological/oncological centers of Hungary. Here the data obtained on 187 ALL patients diagnosed in the period from 1993 to 1995 are presented. In about 75% of patients (in 140 of 187) chromosome analysis was performed, in 78 cases (55.7%) successfully. The proportion of patients with abnormal karyotype was 36 of 78 (46.1%), and hyperdiploidy with more than 50 chromosomes was detected in 13 of 78 (16.6%) children. The lower ratio of hyperdiploid cases in our patients as compared to the data in the literature may be due to technical difficulties and the small number of patients studied, but it may reflect real geographic characteristics. Using flow cytometry, seven of 31 patients investigated (22.5%) proved to be hyperdiploid with a DNA index above 1.16. A higher ratio of hyperdiploid patients in this study calls attention to the significance of simultaneous application of the two methods. Taken together, 16 of 80 (20.0%) successfully studied patients proved to be hyperdiploid (> 50 chromosomes and/or DNA index above 1.16). The pattern of chromosome involvement in our study determined by chromosome analysis and/or FISH technique proved also to be different from the data of large international series. In addition to trisomies of chromosomes 4, 6, 10, 14, 17, 18, 21, and X, which are known to be the most frequently involved chromosomes, trisomies of chromosomes 3, 8, 11, and 13 were also observed with a high frequency. Comparison of survival curves of various cytogenetic subgroups showed a significant difference between diploid-pseudodiploid and diploid-hyperdiploid A (with 47-50 chromosomes) subgroups. No favorable prognosis of hyperdiploid patients (> 50 chromosomes) could be proved. Because of the small number of patients studied, prognostic differences of cytogenetic subgroups need further confirmation. The clinical and genetic differences observed, however, call attention to the necessity for further genetic studies of ALL patients in Hungary, because these differences may reflect real geographic characteristics and may be related to different environmental mutagen/carcinogen effects of the given geographic area. It is essential to determine whether or not these differences really exist and if they do to reveal the causes leading to these differences. In our view this is one of the routes by which the therapeutic results in childhood ALL can be further improved simultaneously with the avoidance of early and late toxicity of chemotherapy.","['Department of Pediatrics, University Medical School of Debrecen, Hungary. olah_e@gyermek.dote.hu']",,,44,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to advancing the understanding of pathological mechanisms underlying the transformation process, the cloning and sequencing of the genes altered by the translocations have provided new tools for diagnosis and monitoring of patients. In particular, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method yields sensitive and accurate diagnostic and prognostic information. Minimal residual disease (MRD) is not clearly defined. In ALL we define MRD as fewer than 5% blast cells in the bone marrow by conventional cytology and proof of leukemic cells with more sensitive methods. The techniques for detecting MRD are imaging for detection of single leukemic cells in the blood, bone marrow, or other tissues by means of immunocytology or PCR/RT-PCR. Highly sensitive PCR, immunocytology, FACS analysis, or conventional cytology are important tools to use in the process of deciding on appropriate therapy. Detection limits at present are 10(-2) for cytology and FISH, up to 10(-4) for immunological procedures, and 10(-5) to 10(-6) for PCR. But multiple methods also imply the possibility of mistakes (e.g., PCR). The question must be raised what method should be decisive in assessing MRD for evaluating autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or autologous bone marrow transplants? Prospective studies will have to answer the question whether MRD should be treated or not and whether purging of bone marrow or PBSC is useful or damaging. When applied, should a positive or a negative immunopurging or a chemotherapeutic purging be used? MRD refers to the organism of the patient as well as to the peripheral blood stem cells and autologous bone marrow that had been taken before myeloablative therapy and kept for retransfusion.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, J.W.

Nevertheless, selecting the patient who could really benefit from this procedure remains a controversial issue. The current consensus is as follows: About 20% of children with ALL can be defined as high-risk patients by criteria such as t(9;22), t(4;11), no complete remission at day 42, poor prednisone response, and T-immunophenotype or pre-pre B-ALL, myeloid markers or more than 100,000 white blood cells/microliter. This high-risk group is eligible for alloBMT in first remission, provided a family-matched donor is available. At relapse the majority of patients will benefit from alloBMT, and alternative donor sources can be considered in high-risk patients. Only early alloBMT relapses (up to 6 months after end of initial therapy) are sure candidates, whereas late relapses, especially extramedullary sites, may equally benefit from an intensive conventional relapse treatment. However, any alloBMT relapse beyond second remission should be transplanted with allogeneic stem cells (bone marrow or peripheral stem cells). In particular, family mismatched donors or matched unrelated donors may be acceptable in high-risk cases beyond first remission. In contrast, ASCR in ALL seems not to be superior to conventional therapy. In AML the standard-risk patient, defined by criteria such as FAB M1/M2-Auer rods positive, all FAB M3, and FAB M4, is not a candidate for SCT in first remission. Patients presenting other criteria or more than 5% of blasts in the bone marrow at day 15 are at high risk in first remission and should be considered for allo BMT if a family matched donor is available. ASCR in first remission AML remains a controversial issue. In contrast, in second remission alloBMT as well as ASCR are superior to conventional chemotherapy.","[""St. Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",,,123,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result of poor socio-economic conditions, worldwide, less than 20% of the approximately 185,000 children developing cancer each year get adequate treatment. This is also true for 14 to 15 million children dying each year of diarrhea and infections, but while this number is decreasing, the number of children with cancer is increasing. In ""middle income"" developing countries, cancer is now a leading cause of death for children between 5 and 15 years of age. The ""geography"" of pediatric cancer reveals complex interactions between environment, lifestyle, and carcinogenesis. The ""mapping"" of pediatric cancer is far from complete, and the investigation of carcinogenetic interactions has barely started. A great challenge is the planning of pediatric oncology in developing countries. The goals are to improve the access to treatment and treatment results. Even if pediatric oncology has a low priority, the institution, in each country or large province, of at least one pediatric cancer unit may improve not only cancer treatment but medical care in general. By promoting education, organizing meetings, and setting minimum standards for training and care, international organizations can contribute to the development of pediatric oncology worldwide.","['Swiss Institute for Applied Cancer Research, Berne, Switzerland.']",,,54,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we test a single family with 11 relevant meioses transmitting autosomal dominant acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia for linkage to three potential candidate loci. In a different family with inherited AML, linkage to chromosome 21q22.1-22.2 was recently reported; we exclude linkage to 21q22.1-22.2, demonstrating that familial AML is a heterogeneous disease. After reviewing familial leukemia and observing anticipation in the form of a declining age of onset with each generation, we had proposed 9p21-22 and 16q22 as additional candidate loci. Whereas linkage to 9p21-22 can be excluded, the finding of a maximum two-point LOD score of 2.82 with the microsatellite marker D16S522 at a recombination fraction theta = 0 provides evidence supporting linkage to 16q22. Haplotype analysis reveals a 23.5-cM (17.9-Mb) commonly inherited region among all affected family members extending from D16S451 to D16S289. In order to extract maximum linkage information with missing individuals, incomplete informativeness with individual markers in this interval, and possible deviance from strict autosomal dominant inheritance, we performed nonparametric linkage analysis (NPL) and found a maximum NPL statistic corresponding to a P-value of .00098, close to the maximum conditional probability of linkage expected for a pedigree with this structure. Mutational analysis in this region specifically excludes expansion of the AT-rich minisatellite repeat FRA16B fragile site and the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the E2F-4 transcription factor. The ""repeat expansion detection"" method, capable of detecting dynamic mutation associated with anticipation, more generally excludes large CAG repeat expansion as a cause of leukemia in this family.","['Markey Molecular Medicine Center, and Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA. horwitz@u.washington.edu']",,"['HD0108-03/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA16448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL07312/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1716007,,,,,,,,,,

One subline of human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells grown under folate-restricted conditions (CEM-7A) exhibited a 95-fold increased Vmax for uptake of [3H]-MTX. The increased uptake of MTX in CEM-7A cells is based on at least two factors: (a) a constitutive 10-fold overexpression of the RFC1 gene and RFC1 message; and (b) a 7-9-fold up-regulation of RFC transport activity under low intracellular reduced folate concentrations. This second component appeared to be regulatable by changes in the cellular folate, purine and methylation status as judged from a 7-9 fold down-regulation of RFC transport activity after short term (1-2 hr) incubation of CEM-7A cells with reduced folate cofactors (25 nM LV), purines (100 microM adenosine) or S-adenosylmethionine (100 microM), respectively. Gradual folate restriction in the cell culture medium of CEM/MTX cells, a subline of CCRF-CEM resistant to MTX due to defective transport via the RFC, revealed the up-regulated expression of an altered RFC protein that is characterized by a 35-fold decreased Km for folic acid and a 10-fold decreased Km for the reduced folate cofactor LV compared to the RFC expressed in CCRF-CEM and CEM-7A cells. As a result of the markedly increased efficiency of folic acid uptake in CEM/MTX cells, intracellular folate pools were 7-fold higher than in CCRF-CEM cells when both cell lines were incubated in the presence of 2 microM folic acid. The high intracellular folate pools in CEM/MTX cells appeared to impair the polyglutamylation of antifolates and confer resistance to ZD1694, an antifolate drug that depends on polyglutamylation for its biological activity. Collectively, these studies provide a better insight into the basic regulation of RFC-mediated membrane transport of clinically active antifolates. In addition, these studies may also provide an opportunity to exploit the transport system as a target for biochemical modulation by which it may contribute to an improved efficacy of folate-based chemotherapy in a clinical setting.","['Department of Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stable analogue, 3,4-dephostatin, potentiated NGF-induced morphological differentiation in rat pheochromocytoma PC12h cells, possibly by inhibition of tyrosine dephosphorylation of MAPK. Erbstatin, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, induced morphological apoptosis and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in mouse leukemia L1210 and human SCLC cells.

We report the case of a B-immunoblastic lymphoma that developed in a pretransplantation EBV-seronegative woman 4 months after kidney transplant from her HLA-haploidentical brother. The patient successfully underwent immunotoxin therapy for lymphoma and has been in remission for 36 months. METHODS: Latent EBV genomes were identified by polymerase chain reaction, and the purified amplification products were directly sequenced with [35S]dATP. RESULTS: Molecular analysis of the latent membrane protein (LMP)1 oncogene of EBV, which was expressed in most tumor cells, revealed a 30-base pair deletion. No wild-type LMP1 sequences were found. Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the EBV-seropositive donor showed the presence of both the LMP1 deletion variant and the wild-type sequence. The LMP1 deletion variant and the wild-type sequence were also identified within peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the EBV-seroconverted kidney recipient 20 months after lymphoma therapy. CONCLUSION: This pattern is consistent with a natural growth advantage of B cells expressing the LMP1 deletion variant in the immunocompromised host.","['Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01655-0246, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it was reported that CD95L expression prevented rejection of allogeneic grafts transplanted under the kidney capsule. In contrast, we reported that enforced CD95L expression in subcutaneously grafted cells induced acute rejection even in the syngeneic or immunodeficient hosts. In this study, we investigated whether the CD95L-expressing cells could be protected from rejection when transplanted under the kidney capsule. METHODS: CD95-negative cells (baby hamster kidney and L5178Y lymphoma cells) were transfected with CD95L cDNA to express functional CD95L. The cells were transplanted into skin or renal subcapsular space of immunocompetent or T cell-deficient nu/nu mice. RESULTS: The parental cells grew well in nu/nu or syngeneic mice but were rejected in allogeneic or xenogeneic immunocompetent mice. The CD95L transfectants were rejected when transplanted subcutaneously in all types of mice studied. However, when transplanted under the kidney capsule, they survived in nu/nu or syngeneic mice but were rejected in allogeneic or xenogeneic immunocompetent mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that CD95L expression may not be sufficient to protect the grafts from rejection, and the survival of CD95L-bearing grafts is substantially influenced by the site of transplantation.","['Department of Immunology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical records of 117 patients (82% AP, 18% PP) seen in four cities of the Mexican Republic were analysed, the clinical course and survival of both groups being compared. RESULTS: No sex difference was found in the two patient-groups: 51% and 52% males, 49% and 48% females in AP and PP, respectively. The onset of PNH had similar distribution for the two groups of patients: aplastic form, 45% in AP and 62% in PP; cytopenias, 24% in AP versus 27% in PP; haemolysis, 28% in AP and 9% in PP, and thrombosis, 3% in AP versus 0% in PP. The clinical features with significant difference were: anaemic+haemorrhagic syndrome (39 AP (40%) vs 14 PP (67%), p = 0.02), initial diagnosis of immunologic thrombocytopenic purpura (7 AP (7%) vs 7 PP (33%), p = 0.003), and death rate (17 AP (18%) vs 8 PP (38%), p = 0.04). The actuarial survival curves showed significant differences between both groups (p = 0.045, Cox-Mantel), with estimated 10-year survival of 81% for AP and 55% for PP, and 15-year survivals of 64% for AP and 55% for PP. CONCLUSIONS: Seemingly, PNH in paediatric age has poorer prognosis than in adults, which is associated to higher incidence of fatal haemorrhages due to thrombocytopenia.","['Centro de Investigaciones Regionales Dr. Hideyo Noguchi, Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan, Merida, Mexico. gbiachi@tunku.uady.mx']",,,27,,,"Historia natural de la hemoglobinuria paroxistica nocturna en adolescentes, adultos y en la edad pediatrica: la experiencia mexicana.",,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using official death certificates and information about the population of the IMSS members during 1991-1995, national and regional annual global cancer mortality as well as specific mortality rates for the 10 most important malignant neoplasms by sex were estimated among people older than 20 years of age. The trends for these neoplasms during the study period were estimated by means of Poisson regression. The rate differences in specific cancer mortality by region and sex, for the two major neoplasms, were calculated subtracting specific regional rates from the respective national rate in 1995. RESULTS: The global mortality rate for cancer among men increased from 76.2 in 1991 to 94.8 x 100000 IMSS' members in 1995; and among women from 85.6 to 105.8 x 100000 IMSS' members, representing an increment of 24.4 and 24% men and women, respectively, during the study period. Among men, neoplasm of kidney, leukemia, pancreas, prostate and lung showed the major increment; among women, neoplasm of colon, breast, pancreas, leukemia and liver showed the most significant increment. CONCLUSIONS: In the IMSS it is necessary the integration of a population based cancer registry. The registry will play a main role in disease surveillance and control; will give basic information over incidence and temporal variation, and could be the main source of information for epidemiologic research, as well as planning and evaluation of the quality of medical attention services such as prevention and early diagnosis and treatment.","['Unidad de Investigacion Epidemiologica, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social.']",,,,,,Panorama epidemiologico de la mortalidad por cancer en el Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social: 1991-1995.,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cytogenetic evolution in 53 patients with CML in chronic phase de novo was studied. They received one of three treatment schemes: a) induction of remission with daunorubicin, vincristine, cytosine arabinose and prednisone (DOAP) and maintenance with IFN (n = 12); b) induction with busulfan (BUS) or hydroxyurea (HYDX) and maintenance with IFN (n = 26); c) induction with DOAP and maintenance with BUS (n = 15). RESULTS: The remission was seen two to six months after the start of treatment: 10 had complete remission, six a partial one, 14 a minor remission and 23 none. The 16 with complete or partial response received treatment with IFN. None of the 15 cases maintained with BUS had complete or partial response. The proportion of cases with complete response (3/12) was slightly lower in patients treated with intensive chemotherapy (BUS/HIDX/IFN) than in those receiving conventional treatment (7/26). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that: a) IFN in combination with chemotherapy induced partial or complete response in 30% of our cases; and b) intensive chemotherapy combined with IFN was not superior in terms of a cytogenetic response to treatment with monodrugs (BUS/HIDX) and IFN.","['Departamentos de Hematologia, Hospital General de Mexico SSa. y Fac. de Medicina, UNAM, Mexico.']",,,,,,El interferon en la erradicacion del cromosoma Filadelfia de la leucemia mieloide cronica.,,,,,,,,,

Expression of PML/RARalpha in hematopoietic precursor cell lines induces block of differentiation and promotes survival. We report here that PML/RARalpha has a potent growth inhibitory effect on all nonhematopoietic cell lines and on the majority of the hematopoietic cell lines tested. Inducible expression of PML/RARalpha in fibroblasts demonstrated that the basis for the growth suppression is induction of cell death. Deletion of relevant promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and retinoic acid receptor (RARalpha) domains within the fusion protein revealed that its growth inhibitory effect depends on the integrity of the PML aminoterminal region (RING, B1, B2, and coiled coil regions) and the RARalpha DNA binding region. Analysis of the nuclear localization of the same PML/RARalpha deletion mutants by immunofluorescence and cell fractionation revealed that the biological activity of the fusion protein correlates with its microspeckled localization and its association to the nuclear matrix. The PML aminoterminal region, but not the RARalpha zinc fingers, is required for the proper nuclear localization of PML/RARalpha. We propose that the matrix-associated microspeckles are the active sites of PML/RARalpha and that targeting of RARalpha sequences to this specific nuclear subdomain through PML sequences is crucial to the activity of the fusion protein on survival regulation.","['European Institute of Oncology, Department of Experimental Oncology, 20141 Milan, Italy.']",,,,,PMC23524,,,,,,,,,,

The biological activity of retinoids is mediated by multiple nuclear receptors which bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate transcription of target genes. Retinoids affect cell growth and differentiation. Retinoids inhibit chemically induced carcinogenesis in experimental animals. Clinical application of retinoids is efficacious to different degrees in prevention and therapy of some malignancies in humans, such as promyelocytic leukaemia, notably in combination chemotherapy. Unfortunately, lack of response, recurrence, toxicity and resistance are observed. Worldwide clinical trials have been set up to evaluate the treatment of mammary carcinoma with retinoids.

We do not know whether the loss of chromosomal material through micronucleus formation is a viable mechanism associated with, and possibly leading to, genetic disease. Previously, we treated L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells with four aneugens. Although these aneugens induced micronuclei containing predominantly whole chromosomes, they did not induce mutations at Tk1, the selectable gene, under the same non-toxic conditions in which they induced micronuclei. This suggested that the induction of micronuclei containing whole chromosomes was not an early event leading to phenotypically expressed mutations in these cells under the conditions used. However, it is possible that chromosome 11, on which Tk1 resides, may be under-represented in the micronucleus population. To find out the frequency of induction of micronuclei containing chromosome 11, we applied fluorescence in situ hybridization using a chromosome 11 paint to micronuclei induced by colcemid and vinblastine. We found that the numbers of micronuclei containing chromosome 11 are more than sufficient to be detectable as mutations if these micronuclei lead to viable mutants. We conclude that the formation of micronuclei containing whole chromosomes does not lead to viable, dividing mutants in this system.","['Department of Toxicology, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, as some authors consider ACCLS a new type of MDS, others maintain that it is in Ph'negative/bcr-abl negative chronic myeloid leukaemia. A new case of ACCLS appeared in a 68 year old woman, who presented with anaemic symptoms, bleeding and recurrent infections, and a haematological picture including progressive macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and leuco-erythroblastosis. Marrow hypercellularity with granulocytic hyperplasia, and mature granulocytes presenting nuclear hyposegmentation and large peripheral blocks of chromatin separated by clear zones were the characteristic features of this case. No cytogenetic abnormalities were found and DNA flow-cytometry content was normal (euploid), supporting the thought that a disequilibrium exists in the hetero-chromatin/eucromatin ration in AACLS. Reverse PCR for bcr-abl transcripts was negative. The cell-cycle-phase analysis showed a high fraction of S-cells in the bone marrow (27%) in contrast to a very low S-phase (0.2%) in the peripheral blood, pattern that is different from both CMML and CML. In vitro clonogenic assays showed a high colony forming capacity and a certain grade of autonomous proliferation of the bone marrow cells, which is reminiscent of the CMML growth behaviour in culture. The patient was treated with vitamin D3, low dose Ara-C, prednisone and hydroxyurea until her demise, fifteen months after diagnosis. In total, the patient received 47 units of packed cells and 114 of platelet concentrates, and was transfused only when she presented anaemic or hemorrhagic symptoms. These clinical and haematological features suggest that ACCLS is a distinct entity that should be considered a sixth type of MDS, beside CMML, with which it has much in common.","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca.']",,,,,,Sindrome de condensacion anomala de la cromatina de los leucocitos con elevada fase de sintesis medular y crecimiento autonomo in vitro.,,,,,,,,,

A minority of patients achieve a long-term disease free survival with a second transplant, but the majority die of toxicity or relapse. We report our experience with second allogeneic transplant for leukemia relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients were treated with a second transplant. Their diagnosis were chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 5) and acute leukemia (n = 5). The interval between transplants ranged from 4 to 59 months (median 26 months). Conditioning regimens were busulfan alone (n = 1), associated to cyclophosphamide (n = 6) or to cyclophosphamide plus etoposide (n = 3). Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin (CSA) (n = 4), CSA plus methotrexate (n = 4), CSA plus prednisolone (n = 1), or CSA, methotrexate plus partial T cell depletion (n = 1). RESULTS: All patients engrafted after second transplant. Seven developed acute GVHD. Four out of the nine patients at risk (44%) developed chronic GVHD. Three had clinical criteria of hepatic veno-occlusive disease. Three patients died in complete remission due to treatment-related toxicity: pulmonary invasive aspergillosis during an acute GVHD, interstitial pneumonitis plus chronic GVHD, and, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, respectively. Two patients relapsed 4 and 5 months after second transplant. Five remained alive in complete remission after a median follow-up of 27 months. In all of them acute or chronic GVHD incidence and severity after second transplant was higher than after the first transplant. All surviving patients were transplanted more than 12 months after the first transplant. CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of patients that relapse after an allogeneic progenitor cells transplant may benefit from second transplant; especially, young patients having a good performance status, and with a long interval between transplants.","['Escuela de Hematologia Farreras-Valenti, Departamento de Medicina, Hospital Clinic i Provincial, Universidad de Barcelona.']",,,,,,Segundo trasplante alogenico de progenitores hematopoyeticos como tratamiento de la recaida leucemica: resultados en 10 pacientes.,,,,,,,,,

Of 239 cases with conclusive information, there was a female predominance in cases with an MLL abnormality (female:male ratio 1.3); this was in marked contrast to cases with normal germline MLL (female:male ratio, 0.7). These potential gender-dependent MLL frequencies should be explored in large populations of infant leukemia and, if confirmed, future investigations could be directed toward potential etiologic mechanisms.","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology & Clinical Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood transfusions are the typical source and HCV-related chronic hepatitis a common outcome. Development of HCV-infection and -related hepatitis raises important questions about subsequent leukemia treatment including the natural history of the infection and need for treatment modification. Although the natural history of HCV-infection and -related hepatitis in this setting is unknown, data from normal persons with HCV-infection suggest that short-term survival is not likely to be decreased in persons with leukemia and these complications. In contrast, long-term survival may decrease because of a high rate of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and possibly hepatocellular carcinoma. There are no convincing data that HCV-infection or -related hepatitis or alterations in anti-leukemia drug dose or schedule prompted by abnormal liver function tests, alter leukemia outcome. Consequently, it is uncertain whether drug doses and/or schedule should be modified in persons with leukemia and HCV-infection or -related hepatitis.

Patients exhibited mediastinal mass (five of six) and lymphoadenopathy (five of six) but without leukocytosis and circulating blast cells (six of six). All patients achieved a complete remission. All but one had a relapse with a transformation to the mixed type (triphenotype--three cases, biphenotype-two cases) including myeloid features in three patients. The altered phenotypes were myeloperoxidase (MPO)+ (three of five), CD13+ (four of five), CD33+ (three of five) and CD19+ (three of five). The difference for MPO-positivity were observed between the bone marrow (BM)- and lymph node (LN)-blast cells (three of three). On cytogenetic analysis, there is no common abnormality in these patients. Immunomolecular analysis revealed T-cell lineage specific delta gene rearrangements [D delta 2-J delta 1 (five of six) and V delta 1-J delta 1 (one of six)] in all cases. Furthermore, D delta 2-J delta 1 occurred even in the cases with the pro-T I phenotype. Rearrangements of TCR beta, gamma or immunoglobulin heavy chain genes occurred in three patients. The same rearranged band(s) appeared at both diagnosis and relapse, indicating the same originality of the pro-T leukemic cell clone (three of three). We suggest that this type of CD7+ early T-ALL/LBL was transformed from a pro-T I or II cell, such as T-stem cell leukemia/lymphoma, which is a subtype of CD7+ stem cell leukemia as defined by Kurtzberg et al.

IL7 showed an heterogeneous responsiveness, not related to immunophenotype or cytogenetic features, proliferation and clonal growth being observed in a minority of ALL.

In one case this inhibition of DNA synthesis was accompanied by maturation of the cells, as demonstrated by the induced expression of surface immunoglobulins (slg); other IL7 treated samples failed to express slg, but showed a decreased expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and cALL antigen, suggesting that the cells have a potential of limited maturation by IL7. SCF, known to synergize with IL7 in the most primitive stages of normal B cell development, did not enhance the IL7 response in B cell precursor ALL.

Several days following the administration of G-CSF, the cells with monocytoid characteristics such as CD11b and cytoplasmic non-specific esterase appeared in the peripheral blood replacing the blastic cells. The cells were shown to be derived from the same clone of the leukemic cell because of the identical TCR-gamma gene rearrangement. The short-term culture of leukemic cells with G-CSF induced the differentiation into a monocyte lineage, resulting in apoptosis.

We present four patients affected by myeloid disorders with an abnormal karyotype and a variable number of dmin. In an attempt to clarify the origin of the dmin and the amplified gene, we utilized a fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) technique and a panel of specific probes. The results of the analysis indicate that, although chromosomes 8 are apparently uninvolved, dmin retained c-MYC sequencs in three cases. By observing previously reported cases, we found that the majority of patients with myeloid disorders and dmin showed an amplified c-MYC gene, regardless of the chromosomal abnormalities. The FISH technique proved to be informative in demonstrating gene amplification in both metaphase and interphase cells. Finally, in the one patient carrying a 20q deletion, FISH allowed the detection of a previously unreported translocation between a 16p and the 20q-, confirming the ability of the technique to understand complex karyotypes.","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By rearranging to each other, the deltaRec and psiJ alpha gene segments delete the TCR-delta gene complex and prepare the allele for subsequent TCR-alpha rearrangement. This intermediate rearrangement is thought to be a specific rearrangement event. In our studies on TCR-delta deletion mechanisms, we identified several T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) with continuous activity of the deltaRec-psiJ alpha rearrangement process. Extensive Southern blot, PCR, and sequencing analyses on the coding joints as well as the signal joints of the deltaRec-psiJ alpha rearrangements in these patients allowed us to prove that this continuous rearrangement activity occurred in the leukemic cells and that these cells, therefore, represent a polyclonal subpopulation within the otherwise monoclonal T-ALL. In additional studies, we also identified a T cell line (DND41) with continuous activity of the deltaRec-psiJ alpha rearrangement process. Our data suggest that the ongoing deltaRec-psiJ alpha gene rearrangements predominantly occur in T cells that cannot express a functional TCR-gammadelta, due to biallelic out-of-frame TCR-delta and/or TCR-gamma gene rearrangements. The described T-ALL and the T cell line can serve as an experimental model in further studies on the regulatory elements involved in the specific deletion of the TCR-delta gene complex.","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Rotterdam and University Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The truncated receptor was expressed in Escherichia coli and recovered in biologically active form following renaturation and anion exchange chromatography. The soluble receptor formed a 1/1 complex with IL-5 in solution and bound IL-5 with affinity comparable to that of cell-associated IL-5Ra. Soluble IL-5Ra also competed with IL-5 for binding to the native alpha beta IL-5R on human cells and inhibited IL-5-mediated receptor activation and inflammatory mediator production. In this regard, the soluble receptor prevented IL-5-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 kinase and IL-5R beta-chain and inhibited IL-5 priming of leukotriene C4 release by human basophils. However, the E. coli-derived receptor failed to inhibit IL-5 in longer term assays, including eosinophil survival and TF-1 cell proliferation, possibly due to its propensity to aggregate in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. In contrast, we observed that a soluble IL-5Ra derived from baculovirus-infected cells was less prone to aggregate and effectively antagonized IL-5-induced cell proliferation and survival. These findings indicate that the extracellular portion of the human IL-5Ra chain can prevent association of IL-5 with cell surface receptors and can attenuate signal transduction, mediator release, and survival of inflammatory cells. As such, soluble IL-5R may be useful in treating diseases such as human asthma, in which pulmonary injury is associated with the activity of IL-5R-bearing cells.","['Department of Inflammatory Diseases Research, G.

This raises the possibility that expression of this death molecule could affect bystander T cells that were not directly antigenically stimulated but that express the CD95 receptor. We show here that bystander T cells, even if they express the CD95 receptor, are not killed when exposed to T cells undergoing Ag-induced apoptosis. Rather, cell death is restricted to T cells that bear the receptor clonotype that is specifically engaged by TCR ligands. At least one mechanism of clonotype restriction is a significant enhancement of CD95-induced apoptosis by TCR ligation. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to the well-known ability of TCR to stimulate apoptosis by inducing CD95 ligand expression, TCR signals at the time of CD95 engagement can effectively increase apoptosis. Therefore, we put forward the hypothesis that strict clonotype specificity is preserved when death cytokines such as CD95 ligand induce autoregulatory mature T cell apoptosis, at least in part through a sensitization signal provided by the TCR stimulation.","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These biopsies are widely used in routine diagnosis of various haematological malignancies and may be the sole material available in many centres; however, information regarding the immunostaining of this material is lacking. METHODS: Biopsies were taken from 72 patients presenting with various haematological malignancies (leukaemia, 38; lymphoma, 14; multiple myeloma, 20). A panel of antibodies was assessed on Bouin's fixed BMT biopsies by the alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase method. RESULTS: Three B (MB2, LN-2, Ki-B5) and two T cell lineage antibodies (UCHL-1, CD3-r) reliably identified lymphoid cells, while MPO-r, Leu-M1/CD15, and KP-1/CD68 recognised cells from the myeloid or histiocytic/macrophage series. Reed-Sternberg cells were stained by LN-2, Leu-M1, and CD30. Antibodies specific for plasma cells (VS38) and hairy cells (DBA.44) gave a variable pattern of staining. Among the proliferation markers, proliferative cell nuclear antigen but not Ki-67 related antibodies were effective. CONCLUSION: This study presents a panel of antibodies with reactivity not restricted to common fixatives that are also suitable for Bouin's fixed BMT biopsies.","['Laboratory of Clinical Molecular Biology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Bruxelles, Belgium. gala@sang.ucl.ac.be']","['J Clin Pathol. 1998 Aug;51(8):638-9.

The expression of trans-dominant inhibitory forms of either CDC42 or Rac1 significantly inhibited antigen-induced degranulation.

PML is normally localised to large matrix-associated nuclear domains (known as ND10, Kr bodies, PODS or PML NBs) which comprise several multi-protein complexes. Within the PML protein, there are a number of identified zinc-binding domains, one of which called the RING finger is found in a large family of diverse and unrelated proteins. Here, we report the effect of site-directed mutations within the context of the whole PML protein, of amino acids found on the surface of the PML RING finger domain and PML NB formation in vivo. Mutations of a small region of the RING finger domain surface affect the size and numbers of PML NBs in a mouse fibroblast expression assay, resulting in fewer but larger exogenous PML NBs. Mutations of other surface RING residues, however, do not affect exogenous PML NB formation. Furthermore, all of the PML RING mutants co-localise to both endogenous and exogenous wild-type PML NBs. These data identify a specific region of the PML RING finger domain which is directly involved in correct PML NB formation. They also provide evidence to suggest that the PML RING finger is involved in mediating PML-PML oligomeric interactions, as part of a mechanism leading to the assembly of the PML NB complex.","['The Scripps Research Institute, Department of Molecular Biology, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, stimulation of both cell lines by the differentiation-inducing phorbol ester TPA revealed reduced responsiveness of TUR cells in the expression of alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase and the generation of O2(-)-anions as compared with U937 cells. Injection into scid mice resulted in potent and rapid tumor development of TUR cells: while 87% of U937-cell injections resulted in tumors after about 14 days, 100% of TUR cell injections produced a tumor after only 11 days, with a tumor area approximately 3.1-times larger than tumors generated by U937 cells. In this context, Western-blot analysis of the myc family revealed high levels of c-myc protein accumulation in TUR cells even in the presence of TPA. In contrast, incubation of U937 cells with phorbol ester was associated with progressive down-regulation of c-myc protein. c-myc can also form transcriptionally active heterodimeric complexes with the nuclear phosphoproteins p20/p22 max: thus, TPA treatment resulted in down-regulation of the p20 form of max in TUR cells.

Previously, we reported on the association between expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), and the lung resistance protein (LRP) with the MDR phenotype in the NCI panel of 60 human cancer cell lines used for in vitro anticancer drug screening. Eight cell lines from this panel, manifesting widely divergent levels of in vitro drug resistance were chosen to investigate the role of MRP and LRP expression at the molecular level. LRP mRNA levels, as determined by ribonuclease protection assay, varied significantly among the 8 cell lines, and correlated closely with in vitro drug resistance to both MDR and non-MDR related drugs. LRP mRNA expression was determined to be a stronger correlate of drug sensitivity than protein expression. In contrast, MRP mRNA levels were not significantly correlated with drug sensitivity. The rates of newly transcribed LRP or MRP mRNA did not correlate with mRNA levels, indicating that mRNA stability or other features of processing may be important in regulation of LRP and MRP mRNA levels. Using Southern blot analysis, LRP gene amplification was shown not to be associated with LRP overexpression. These data suggest that LRP expression may be an important determinant of the MDR phenotype in cell lines intrinsically resistant to cancer chemotherapeutic agents.","['Division of Cancer Treatment, Diagnosis and Centers, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, MD 21702, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were 23 males and 16 females with a median age of 37 years (range: 15-65). Eighteen patients had common ALL, seven had pre-B ALL, three early-precursor B ALL, seven T-ALL and four had aberrant expression of myeloid antigens (c-ALL in three and pre-B ALL in one). The median initial leukocyte count was 11.8 x 10(9)/l (range: 0.65-295). Cytogenetic result of the marrow was available in 16 of 39 patients (41 per cent) and showed Philadelphia positivity in six, a normal result in six and one each of t(4,11), t(1,19), hyperdiploidy and del 12p. Hepatosplenomegaly was present in about 20 per cent of the patients. L-Asparaginase-related hepatic toxicity was the commonest toxicity (48.7 per cent) during phase I of induction. Prolonged pancytopenia and hypoplastic death were common during phase II. With the use of growth factors during the neutropenic period of phase II induction, the rate of hypoplastic death was reduced from 40 per cent to 3 per cent. Common causes of treatment failure included early hypoplastic death (27.8 per cent) and leukemia relapses (50 per cent) while primary refractory leukemia, hepatic failure and perforated peptic ulcer contributed to 11.1, 5.5 and 5.5 per cent of the other deaths. A high complete remission (CR) rate (87.4 per cent) was achieved after phase I induction. The median event-free survival (EFS) was 8 months and the 3-year event-free survival was 43 per cent. This result compared favourably to the other regimens previously employed in our institution. In conclusion, satisfactory survival can be achieved with this intensive regimen. Good supportive care was however, essential to minimize toxicities.","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-three (13%) of them refused to participate to the study, one hundred and fifteen (87%) of them, thirty-one (21%) case and one hundred and nineteen (79%) controls, were interviewed. Nineteen (61%) of cases were males, twelve (39%) of cases were exposed; seventy-two (60.5%) of controls were males, fourty-five (38%) of controls were exposed. The risk of hemolymphoietic tumors associated with exposure was null (O.R. = 1.04; I.C. 95% = 0.42-2.50); no job category (farmer, farm labourer, breeder) was statistically significant associate with cases.

Sargramostim enhances neutrophil recovery and myeloid engraftment, reduces infectious complications, and shortens the duration of hospitalization in selected patients. The high cost of sargramostim and other myeloid growth factors and their ability to reduce infections and days of hospitalization have generated interest in their pharmacoeconomic impact. Cost minimization studies in patients receiving chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia and in recipients of autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) show estimated cost savings with sargramostim of 1996 US$12,513 and 1994 US$14,500, respectively. These data are consistent with cost savings of 1989 US$16,000 using molgramostim in autologous BMT recipients. Although no pharmacoeconomic data have been published in patients with other conditions, clinical outcomes research demonstrates a clear benefit for sargramostim administration in recipients of peripheral blood progenitor cell and allogeneic BMT and in patients who experience graft delay or failure.

The levels and activity of the proteins of the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex are normal in 180BR cells. To facilitate a measurement of V(D)J recombination, we have characterized 180BRM, a SV40-transformed line derived from 180BR. 180BRM retains the radiosensitivity and defect in DSB repair characteristic of 180BR. The activities associated with DNA-dependent protein kinase are also normal in 180BRM cells. The ability to carry out V(D)J recombination is comparable in 180BRM and a reference control transformed human cell line, MRC5V1. These results show that 180BR and 180BRM differ from the rodent mutants belonging to ionizing radiation complementation groups 4, 5, 6, and 7 and, therefore, represent a new mutant phenotype, in which a defect in DNA DSB rejoining is not associated with defective V(D)J recombination. Furthermore, we have shown that 180BR can arrest at the G1-S and G2-M cell cycle checkpoints after irradiation. These results confirm that 180BR can be distinguished from ataxia telangiectasia.","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite de Recherche Associee 1967, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because HLA-A24 is the most common allele in Japanese and is also frequently present in Caucasians, MAGE-3-encoded synthetic peptides with binding affinity for HLA-A24 were thus tested for the induction of specific CTLs from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HLA-A24 healthy donors using a simplified method. By using a peptide with a sequence of IMPKAGLLI (amino acid position in MAGE-3 195-203), the CTL responses could thus be induced from unseparated PBMCs by stimulation with freshly isolated, peptide-pulsed PBMCs as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and by also using interleukin 7 and keyhole limpet hemocyanin for a primary culture. The induced CTLs could lyse HLA-A24 carcinoma cells expressing MAGE-3, as well as the peptide-pulsed target cells, in an HLA class-I restricted manner. The identification of the MAGE-3/HLA-A24 peptide, IMPKAGLLI, may thus potentially offer the opportunities to design peptide-based immunotherapeutic approaches that might prove to be effective in treating patients with MAGE-3-positive malignant tumors.","['Department of Surgery, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Beppu, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Busulphan has been displaced by hydroxyurea where rapid control of the leukocyte count is required. It is generally accepted that interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) prolongs life for those who achieve a major or complete cytogenetic response and it may also prolong life for those who achieve only a haematological response. Thus routinely most newly diagnosed patients are started on treatment with IFN-alpha alone or in combination with other agents and this agent is continued if possible for 2 or more years. Because allografting is the only way of curing patients with CML, those under the age of 50 or 60 years who have HLA-identical siblings should be offered treatment by allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation; however, the risks of morbidity and mortality remain appreciable. Transplants with stem cells from phenotypically HLA-matched donors should also be considered for younger patients. The role of autografting is not yet clearly established; a series of controlled studies comparing autografting with IFN-alpha have therefore been activated. Because patients usually retain in their blood and marrow substantial numbers of Ph-negative stem cells a variety of methods designed to favour collection in vivo or isolation in vitro of Ph-negative stem cells are currently under investigation. To integrate these different approaches to treating patients with CML in chronic phase a variety of algorithms or flow charts have been proposed but many of the criteria on which the recommended treatment decisions are based remain controversial or ill-defined.","['Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK.']",,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,

The standard method to assess the quality of remission in these patients is cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow derived metaphases. However, the molecular definition of the t(9;22) and its consequences has enabled other tests to be developed that can specifically detect CML cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses chromosomes to detect either the juxtaposition of BCR and ABL sequences or the disruption of these genes; Southern blotting analyses genomic DNA to determine whether the BCR gene is rearranged; reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses RNA to determine the presence or absence of BCR-ABL transcripts; Western blotting analyses cell lysates to determine the presence or absence of BCR-ABL protein. Each of these techniques has particular advantages and pitfalls but in general they may be used to replace or at least to reduce the frequency of conventional cytogenetic analysis. Partly because of economic factors and the lack of standardization or effective quality control, these assays are still largely restricted to research laboratories. The sensitivity with which residual leukaemia can be detected suggests that FISH, Southern blotting and Western blotting are likely to be most useful in assessing patient response to interferon-alpha or other forms of treatment that typically induce partial remission. RT-PCR is by far the most sensitive assay and is probably most appropriate for monitoring patients who are in complete remission.","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",,,79,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autografting is being actively explored as a therapeutic option which may improve on the survival data seen with interferon and numerous different autografting methodologies are being investigated. While it seems reasonable to hope that a suitably robust and safe approach to autografting may improve survival it is unlikely with current technology that long-term disease-free survival will be achieved.

Induction of remission with donor leukocyte infusions has been primarily successful for CML patients who have cytogenetic relapse or those with chronic-phase haematological relapse. Response rates appear to be lower in patients who have advanced-phase CML. The majority of patients with CML who enter remission have no detectable minimal residual disease when analysed for BCR-ABL mRNA transcripts by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The efficacy of donor leukocyte infusions and the ease of therapy are balanced by the potential for significant toxicity. The reported treatment-related mortality rate is almost 20%.

The use of lower doses of T cells or CD8+ depleted T cells may be associated with less GVHD. The optimal treatment schedule using donor leukocytes has yet to be determined.

The majority of patients in blastic phase demonstrate clonal evolution; three specific abnormalities (+Ph, +8 and isochromosome 17q) are present in 70% of patients. Loss of the Ph chromosome on therapy is associated with prolonged survival.

In its initial chronic phase, the leukaemic clone exhibits a hierarchical structure that closely resembles normal haematopoiesis. Thus assays for in vitro colony-forming cells (CFC) and their more primitive precursors identified as long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) detect subsets of Ph+/BCR-ABL+ cells which cannot be readily distinguished from their normal counterparts. The use of these assays to examine the numbers, properties, genotype, distribution and regulation of primitive progenitors in patients' blood and marrow samples have revealed a number of unique and unexpected findings. These suggest that the indolent nature of the chronic phase of the disease may be explained by competing effects of the BCR-ABL gene product on the commitment to differentiate, control of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. As a result, the amplification of BCR-ABL+ stem cells is constrained but the expansion of their progeny is enhanced and, on the granulocyte pathway, this expansion proceeds unchecked to the stage of mature end cell production resulting in the leukaemic picture observed.","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",,,107,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current research efforts are focused on defining the mechanism by which BCR-ABL transforms cells, with a view toward applying insights from these studies to the treatment of CML patients. BCR-ABL contains tyrosine residues, an SH2 domain, an SH3 domain, and proline-rich sequences. The presence of so many protein-protein interaction domains raises the possibility of multiple contacts with cellular signal transduction pathways. Indeed, BCR-ABL is reported to bind and/or phosphorylate more than 20 proteins. Many of these can be directly linked to signal transduction pathways based on defined roles in other systems, but others have no known function. As the list of such proteins grows, it is critical to define the role of each in the leukaemogenic activity of BCR-ABL. This review summarizes current views of the mechanism of BCR-ABL transformation with emphasis on the substrates and signal transduction pathways affected by its tyrosine kinase activity.","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90095, USA.']",,['2-PO1-CA32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],61,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion protein encoded by BCR-ABL varies in size, depending on the breakpoint in the BCR gene. Three breakpoint cluster regions have been characterized to date: major (M-bcr), minor (m-bcr) and micro (mu-bcr). The overwhelming majority of CML patients have a p210 BCR-ABL gene (M-bcr), whose mRNA transcripts have a b3a2 and/or a b2a2 junction. There is apparently no significant difference between patients with a 5' or a 3' M-bcr breakpoint, except maybe for a slight predominance of b3a2-expressing cases among those with increased platelet counts (ET-like syndrome). The smallest of the fusion proteins, p190BCR-ABL, (m-bcr breakpoint) is principally associated with Ph-positive ALL. Rare cases of CML are due to a p190-type of BCR-ABL gene and, in these, the disease tends to have a prominent monocytic component, resembling CMML. CML resulting from a p230 BCR-ABL gene (mu-bcr breakpoint) is also rare, and has been associated with the CNL variant and/or with marked thrombocytosis. Exceptional CML cases have been described with BCR breakpoints outside the three defined cluster regions, or with unusual breakpoints in ABL resulting in BCR-ABL transcripts with b2a3 or b3a3 junctions, or with aberrant fusion transcripts containing variable lengths of intronic sequence inserts. The reciprocal ABL-BCR gene found in the derivative 9q+ chromosome of the t(9;22) is transcriptionally active in nearly two-thirds of CML patients but has not been shown so far to have a functional role in CML. 'Ph-negative CML' comprises cases of typical CML in whom the BCR-ABL gene can be detected by molecular methods and others who are genuinely BCR-ABL negative and usually have an atypical disease phenotype.","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",,,119,,,,,,,,,,,,

An overexpression of cyclin D1 is induced by the chromosomal translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32), which characterizes non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) of mantle cell type. We studied 26 cases of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) for the expression of cyclins D1 and D3. A total of 23 lymphomas showed a nuclear staining for cyclin D1, whereas reactive B cells of residual germinal centers were constantly negative. When compared with cyclin D3, an inverse staining pattern emerged. Whereas the B cells of residual germinal centers reacted strongly positive for cyclin D3, there was low or missing expression of cyclin D3 in MCL cells. In other B-cell lymphomas (n = 55), including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, low-grade lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue, follicular lymphomas, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, no cyclin D1 expression could be detected and 89% of these cases displayed cyclin D3 positivity. Lymphoma cell lines harboring the t(11;14) showed cyclin D1 protein but no or very low levels of cyclin D3; three other B-cell lines, a T-cell line, and peripheral blood lymphocytes strongly expressed cyclin D3 and reacted negatively for cyclin D1. We conclude that the chromosomal translocation t(11;14) leads to an abnormal protein expression of cyclin D1 in the tumor cells of MCL and induces a consecutive downregulation of cyclin D3. In contrast to other B-NHLs, cyclin D1 and D3 expression in MCL is not related to the growth fraction.","['Institute of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report that Tax induces the human prointerleukin-1beta (IL1B) gene promoter in monocytic cells. In our transient transfection assays using human THP-1 monocytic cells, a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct containing the IL1B promoter sequence between positions -131 and +12 showed an approximately 90-fold increase in activity following cotransfection of a Tax expression vector. Moreover, Tax synergized with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce the IL1B promoter activity. Analyses of specific nucleotide substitutions further indicated that the Tax-induced transcriptional activation requires two transcription factor binding motifs within the IL1B promoter; one is a binding site for nuclear factor (NF)-IL6 (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta, C/EBP beta), which belongs to the basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) family and the other for Spi-1 (PU.1), which is an Ets family protein found principally in monocytes, macrophages, and B lymphocytes. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using in vivo THP-1 nuclear extracts, Tax expression in THP-1 monocytic cells significantly increased binding of the two factors to their target IL1B promoter sequences. However, in contrast to NF-IL6 and Spi-1, DNA binding activity of Oct-1, an ubiquitously expressed octamer-binding protein was not affected by Tax. Additional EMSA using in vitro translated proteins also showed that recombinant Tax enhances DNA binding of both of recombinant NF-IL6 and Spi-1 proteins.

We have now generated somatic cell hybrids from a newly described patient with this specific structural rearrangement and analyzed the breakpoints on the derivative chromosomes. We have shown that the breakpoint on chromosome 13 lies within a 300- to 500-kb region defined by the KIAA177 gene and D13S1123 marker. In addition, we have identified a 1.2-Mb YAC, 959A4, that crosses the translocation breakpoint on the short arm of chromosome 8 in this patient. The location of this breakpoint in 8p11 is distinct from the t(8;16) and t(8;22) translocations associated with M4/M5 myeloid leukemias, and suggests that three distinct loci located within 8p11 are involved in the pathogenesis of myeloid neoplasias.","['Department of Neurosciences, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, a myeloproliferative disorder with features characteristic of both chronic myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and second, an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with French-American-British (FAB) M4/5 morphology and prominent erythrophagocytosis. The two syndromes are exemplified by a t(8;13)(p11;q12) and a t(8;16)(p11;p13), respectively, but cytogenetic variants of both have been described. Recently, the t(8;16) has been cloned and shown to fuse the MOZ gene at 8p11 to the CBP gene at 16p13. We have used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blotting, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to refine the 8p11 breakpoint in three cases with t(8;13)(p11;q12) and in a single case of AML-M5 with a clinical picture apparently identical to that found in patients with a t(8;16), but characterized by an inv(8)(p11q13). FISH analysis was performed with several 8p11 CEPH yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones. YAC 782H11 was centromeric to the one case with t(8;13) tested, but was telomeric to the inv(8). YAC 847B12 was telomeric to both the t(8;13) and the inv(8), whereas YAC 829D12 was centromeric to the t(8;13), but split by the inv(8). Southern blotting and PCR of YAC 829D12 showed that it contained the MOZ gene. A 900-bp MOZ fragment encompassing the published t(8;16) breakpoint was amplified by PCR from normal peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA and used to probe Southern blots of patient DNA. A rearrangement was detected in the case with inv(8), but not in any of the three cases with t(8;13). Southern blotting with a CBP probe and RT-PCR with MOZ and CBP primers suggested that the inv(8) does not result in a cryptic MOZ-CBP fusion. It is likely, therefore, that MOZ is fused to a novel gene at 8q13 in this case. We conclude that the t(8;13) breakpoint is flanked by YACs 782H11 and 847B12 and is at least 1 Mb telomeric to MOZ. MOZ is involved, however, in a new variant of the t(8;16).","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that tumor cells resistant to CD95 (APO-1/Fas) -mediated apoptosis were cross-resistant to apoptosis-induced by anticancer drugs. Apoptosis induced in tumor cells by cytarabine, doxorubicin, and methotrexate required the activation of ICE/Ced-3 proteases (caspases), similarly to the CD95 system. After drug treatment, a strong increase of caspase activity was found that preceded cell death. Drug-induced activation of caspases was also found in ex vivo-derived T-cell leukemia cells. Resistance to cell death was conferred by a peptide caspase inhibitor and CrmA, a poxvirus-derived serpin. The peptide inhibitor was effective even if added several hours after drug treatment, indicating a direct involvement of caspases in the execution and not in the trigger phase of drug action. Drug-induced apoptosis was also strongly inhibited by antisense approaches targeting caspase-1 and -3, indicating that several members of this protease family were involved. CD95-resistant cell lines that failed to activate caspases upon CD95 triggering were cross-resistant to drug-mediated apoptosis. Our data strongly support the concept that sensitivity for drug-induced cell death depends on intact apoptosis pathways leading to activation of caspases. The identification of defects in caspase activation may provide molecular targets to overcome drug resistance in tumor cells.","[""Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Ulm, Germany.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our studies showed that levels of C/EBP epsilon mRNA were markedly increased in NB4 cells (promyelocytic leukemia line), because they were induced by 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cis RA) to differentiate towards granulocytes. Accumulation of C/EBP epsilon mRNA occurred as early as 1 hour after exposure of NB4 cells to 9-cis RA (5 x 10(-7) mol/L); and at 48 hours, levels were increased by 5.1-fold. Dose-response studies showed that 10(-7) to 10(-6) mol/L 9-cis RA (12 hours) resulted in peak levels of C/EBP epsilon mRNA; but even 10(-10) mol/L 9-cis RA increased levels of these transcripts. NB4 cells pulse-exposed (30 minutes) to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), washed, and cultured (3 days) with either dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) had a prominent increase in levels of C/EBP epsilon mRNA and an increase in granulocytic differentiation, but exposure to either DMSO or HMBA alone had no effect on base levels of C/EBP epsilon and did not induce differentiation. Macrophage-differentiation of NB4 reduced levels of C/EBP epsilon mRNA. Nuclear run-off assays and half-life studies showed that accumulation of C/EBP epsilon mRNA by 9-cis RA was due to enhanced transcription. Furthermore, this C/EBP epsilon mRNA accumulation did not require synthesis of new protein factors because 9-cis RA induced C/EBP epsilon mRNA accumulation in the absence of new protein synthesis. ATRA also induced expression of C/EBP epsilon protein in NB4 cells, as shown by Western blotting. In contrast to the increase of C/EBP epsilon in 9-cis RA-mediated granulocytic differentiation, the DMSO-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells down the granulocytic pathway was associated with an initial reduction of C/EBP epsilon mRNA levels. In summary, we have discovered that expression of C/EBP epsilon mRNA is markedly enhanced as the NB4 promyelocytes are induced by retinoids to differentiate towards granulocytes. This induction of C/EBP epsilon mRNA expression is transcriptionally mediated and occurs in the absence of synthesis of additional protein factors. We suspect that the C/EBP epsilon promoter/enhancer contains a retinoic acid-response element that is directly stimulated by retinoids.","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",,['GM08042/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

After achievement of a CR, patients up to the age of 40 and having an HLA-identical sibling were assigned to undergo an allogeneic BMT. All the other patients received a first course of ICC with high-dose cytarabine and the same anthracycline as for induction. They were then randomly assigned to either receive a second course of ICC with amsacrine and etoposide or a combination of busulfan and cyclosphosphamide followed by an unpurged autologous BMT.

In multivariate analysis, DFS and OS were influenced only by the initial white blood cell count and by the French-American-British classification. The type of postremission therapy had no significant impact on the outcome. There was no difference in the 4-year DFS and OS between 88 patients for whom an allogeneic BMT was scheduled (respectively, 44% and 53%) and 134 patients of the same age category and without an HLA-identical sibling (respectively, 38% and 53%).

These entities are distinguished primarily by marrow blast percentage (5% to 19% RAEB, 20% to 29% RAEB-t, and > or = 30% AML). The poor prognosis of many RAEB or RAEB-t patients, if untreated, led us to give them AML Rx using the same plan as for AML. The purpose of this analysis was to see if diagnosis (RAEB, RAEB-t, or AML) affected outcome. We treated 372 patients with AML (acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL] excluded), 106 with RAEB-t, and 52 with RAEB. AML Rx produced a 62% complete remission (CR) rate in RAEB, essentially identical to the rates in RAEB-t and AML, but event-free survival (EFS) from CR and from start of treatment (start of Rx), as well as overall survival, were poorer in RAEB than in AML or RAEB-t, with AML and RAEB-t being identical. However, patients with RAEB or RAEB-t were more likely to have poor prognostic characteristics, in particular complex abnormalities involving chromosomes 5 and/or 7. Multivariate analyses indicated that, when considered together with cytogenetics and other patient characteristics, a diagnosis of RAEB rather than AML or RAEB-t had no effect on EFS from start of Rx, EFS from CR, survival, or achievement of CR. These analyses suggested a trend for patients with RAEB-t to have better EFS from start of Rx than patients with AML or RAEB (P = .08; relative risk, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.03), but there were no differences with respect to the other outcomes. Our data suggest that the propriety of administering AML Rx to patients with RAEB or RAEB-t who have poor prognosis without treatment is identical to the propriety of treating AML in this fashion. Deterrents to standard AML Rx in these patients could justifiably include cytogenetics, age, etc, but not a diagnosis of RAEB or RAEB-t per se.","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Those lacking a related donor can receive either autologous or histocompatible unrelated donor (URD) marrow. Autotransplantation may result in higher risk of relapse, whereas URD allografts, although associated with serious posttransplant toxicities, may reduce relapse risk. Six years (1987 to 1993) of consecutive autologous BMT (University of Minnesota, Dana Farber Cancer Institute; n = 214) were compared with URD transplants (National Marrow Donor Program; n = 337). Most transplants (70% autologous, 48% URD) were in early remission (first or second complete remission [CR1 or CR2]); 376 patients (75% autologous, 64% URD) were less than 18 years old. Autologous BMT led to significantly lower transplant-related mortality (TRM; relative risk [RR] 0.35; P = .001). URD transplantation offered greater protection against relapse (autologous RR 3.1; P = .001). Patients greater than 18 years old, women, and BMT recipients beyond CR2 had higher TRM, whereas adults, BMT recipients in CR2+, or BMT recipients during 1991 through 1993 had significantly more relapse. After 25 months median follow-up, 100 URD and 56 autologous recipients survive leukemia free. URD BMT in CR2 resulted in superior disease-free survival (DFS), especially for adult patients. Multivariate analysis showed superior DFS for children, men, and BMT during CR1 or 2. Autologous and URD BMT can extend survival for a minority of patients unlikely to be cured by chemotherapy, and the results with either technique are comparable.

Patients were randomized to either receive daunomycin-cytosine arabinoside with GM-CSF or daunomycin-cytosine arabinoside (control arm). Based on the rationale that GM-CSF might sensitize the leukemic cells to the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy as well as enhance white blood cell regeneration, GM-CSF was given during chemotherapy as well as after chemotherapy. Patients were treated with one, and in case of a partial response, with two remission induction cycles. When a complete remission was attained they received one additional cycle of consolidation therapy. Of 318 evaluable patients with a median age of 68 years, 157 were randomized to receive GM-CSF and 161 were assigned to control therapy. The effect of GM-CSF on treatment was evaluated according to intention-to-treat. Complete remission was achieved in 56% of the patients in the GM-CSF group and 55% of the control patients (P = .98). Recovery of neutrophils was significantly faster in GM-CSF-treated patients. The median time of recovery of neutrophils towards 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 23 days in the GM-CSF group versus 25 days in the control group (P = .0002) with the percentages of patients who recovered being 81% and 71%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 36 months, the probabilities of survival at 2 years after randomization were estimated at 22% for individuals assigned to the GM-CSF treatment as well as for control patients (P = .55). Disease-free survival at 2 years compared 15% and 19% for the two treatment groups (P = .69). The number of nights spent in the hospital, number of transfusions, and frequencies and types of hemorrhages and infections did not differ either. The cytogenetic results at diagnosis of this study in elderly AML shows that there is a relatively high numerical representation of patients with abnormal cytogenetics (55% of documented cases), who showed significantly inferior response rates and survival duration. We conclude that, except for a faster neutrophil recovery, GM-CSF during and after induction chemotherapy does not improve the clinical outcome of elderly patients with AML.","['Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,"['5U 10 CA 11488-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U 10 CA 11488-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U 10 CA 11488-22/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

For both groups, an abnormal chromosome (abn) 5 and/or 7 or a hypodiploid karyotype had a poor outcome, whereas t(15;17), pseudodiploidy, hyperdiploidy and diploidy were associated with a standard prognosis. Abn (16) and t(8;21) were also of standard prognosis for ABMT, but favorable for AlloBMT. When comparing AlloBMT and ABMT in patients with favorable or standard cytogenetics, AlloBMT was of benefit for remission duration and leukemia-free survival (LFS). Patients with an unfavorable karyotype had a similar outcome, regardless of type of BMT. By multivariate analysis, cytogenetics at diagnosis had the strongest prognostic value for relapse, LFS, and survival in AlloBMT. In ABMT, cytogenetics influenced relapse and LFS.

However, determination of structure and adhesive function of carbohydrates in glycoproteins is extremely difficult because of the extensive structural heterogeneity and the scarcity of material for functional analysis. We have overcome this difficulty through use of poly-LacNAc gangliosides isolated from a large quantity of ( approximately 1.2 L packed) HL60 cells [Stroud, M. R., Handa, K., Salyan, M. E. K., Ito, K., Levery, S. B., Hakomori, S., Reinhold, B. B., & Reinhold, V. N. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 758-769, 770-778]. We identified two major types of poly-LacNAc gangliosides without the sialosyl-Lex epitope as being capable of binding to E-selectin: (i) those having a single alpha1-->3 fucosylation at internal GlcNAcs but not at the penultimate GlcNAc and (ii) those having double alpha1-->3 fucosylation at internal GlcNAcs, excluding the penultimate GlcNAc. Gangliosides from group i above did not show any adhesion under static conditions, but showed strong adhesion under dynamic flow conditions. Gangliosides from group ii above showed adhesion under both static and dynamic conditions, as did sialosyl-Lex (SLex)-containing structures in previous studies. However, SLex-containing poly-LacNAc gangliosides are virtually absent or present in only trace quantities in leukocytes and HL60 cells. Poly-LacNAc gangliosides from groups i and ii above, lacking SLex structure, are the major membrane components of leukocytes and HL60 cells. These carbohydrates, bound to lipid or to protein, may therefore be the physiological epitope for E-selectin-dependent binding of these cells, particularly under dynamic flow conditions.","['Pacific Northwest Research Foundation, 720 Broadway, Seattle, Washington 98122, USA.']",,['CA42505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study identifies the novel nucleic acid stain SYTO16 as a highly sensitive and specific dye to assess P-gp function. The effect of P-gp is expressed here as the ratio of dye fluorescence (RF) from cells incubated with dye with or without 2 microM of the P-gp inhibitor PSC 833. Using flow cytometric analysis, an RF of 0.9 was found for SYTO16 in the KB3-1 (P-gp-) and 1.6 in KB8 (P-gp+) cells. Three types of patients' cells were studied: (1) in haematopoietic CD34+ cells, which are known to express P-gp, the RF was 6.0 for SYTO16 compared with 2.5 for rhodamine 123 and 1.3 for daunorubicin (mean of five individuals); (2) in acute myeloid leukaemia cells, the RF for SYTO16 was 1.0 in P-gp- and 4.5 in P-gp+ samples; (3) for the first time, we have quantitated P-gp function in fresh human solid tumour (sarcoma) cells. We found, in a P-gp+ leiomyosarcoma, an RF of 16 for SYTO16 and 2.7 for daunorubicin. This means that complete inhibition of P-gp function in these sarcoma cells would lead to an increase of daunorubicin accumulation with 170% compared with 30% in the CD34+ cells. Next, we showed that SYTO16 could be fixed in nuclei by 3.6% formaldehyde treatment, allowing quantification of the nuclear fluorescence on cytospins by laser scanning microscopy. In conclusion, SYTO16 proved to have a combination of favourable properties: it can be excited at 488 nm and has large fluorescence enhancement upon binding to nucleic acids, allowing the use of low, nontoxic (< 10 nM) concentrations. Because the RF for SYTO16 is much higher than for daunorubicin, it can be applied for the determination of P-gp function in relatively small numbers of low-P-gp-expressing tumour cells by laser scanning microscopy. Individual sarcomas were found to have high P-gp function compared with CD34+ cells. This assay may be used to select patients for P-gp modulation protocols.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Academisch Ziekenhuis Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,PMC2228098,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-six patients of the multicentre treatment trial AML HD93 were enrolled in this study, and a sufficient number of PBPC was harvested in 30 (83%). Individual peak concentrations of CD34+ cells in the blood varied (range 13.1-291.5/microl; median 20.0/microl). To reach the target quantity of 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg, between one and six (median two) leukaphereses (LP) were performed. The LP products contained between 0.2 x 10(6) and 18.9 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (median 1.2 x 10(6)/kg). Multivariate analysis showed that the white blood cell count prior to HAM and the time interval from the start of HAM therapy to reach an unsupported platelet count > 20 x 10(9)/l were predictive for the peak value of CD34+ cells in the blood during the G-CSF stimulated haematological recovery. In 16 patients an intraindividual comparison was made between bone marrow (BM) and PBPC grafts. Compared to BM grafts, PBPC grafts contained 14-fold more MNC, 5-fold more CD34+ cells and 36-fold more CFU-GM. A CD34+ subset analysis showed that blood-derived CD34+ cells had a more immature phenotype as indicated by a lower mean fluorescence intensity for HLA-DR and CD38. In addition, the proportion of CD34+/Thy-1+ cells tended to be greater in the PBPC grafts. The data indicate that sufficient PBPC can be collected in the majority of patients with AML following intensive double induction and first consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone.","['Medizinische Klinik and Poliklinik V, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this pilot study we treated nine patients who had advanced myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) and progressive hepatomegaly or symptomatic thrombocytosis after therapeutic splenectomy. 2-CdA was administered at 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/d for 7 d for one to five treatment cycles. A reduction in liver size associated with marked improvement in fatigue and control of thrombocytosis and leucocytosis was achieved in seven of the nine patients (78% response rate). In four of the seven responding patients the reduction in liver size was durable (4-28 months) and was associated with a decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase levels. However, no patient had improvement in anaemia, and two of the seven initially responding patients have since died of acute leukaemia or progressive disease. Improvement in bone marrow fibrosis was noted in two of five available post-treatment marrow examinations.

However, the source of NTBI during myelosuppressive chemotherapy is controversial. In this study we have examined the kinetics of the appearance and disappearance of NTBI with chemotherapy. NTBI was present in only two out of 24 patients prior to chemotherapy but, following chemotherapy, was present in 19 patients, with peak NTBI levels at 5 d after onset of chemotherapy (mean 3.06 microM). Thereafter levels fell, but were still detectable in seven patients 14 d after the end of chemotherapy. The appearance of NTBI was associated with a sudden rise in transferrin saturation, but NTBI was detected on four occasions in the absence of full transferrin saturation. We have also established that daunorubicin cannot itself liberate NTBI from serum. There was no relationship between induced NTBI levels and serum iron or ferritin levels, previous or current blood transfusions, disease stage, or the type of chemotherapy given. The appearance of NTBI following chemotherapy was inverserely related to the fall in reticulocytes and serum transferrin receptor (TfR) levels, suggesting that NTBI formation is a consequence of suspension of erythropoietic activity.","['Department of Haematology, University College London.']",['Br J Haematol. 1998 May;101(2):393-4.

Patients were admitted to 18 haematology divisions in tertiary care or university hospitals in Italy between 1987 and 1995. Fever, thoracic pain, dyspnoea and cough were the most frequent presenting symptoms. At the onset, 89% patients were neutropenic (neutrophil counts < 0.5 x 10(9)/l) with a median duration of previous neutropenia of 14 d (range 6-60). The most frequent sites of infection were lungs (81%), CNS (27%), sinus (16%), liver (16%) and orbital space (10%). Only three patients were asymptomatic. A correct in vivo diagnosis was made in only 13 (35%) patients. When performed, thoracic and cranial CT scan were the most useful diagnostic investigations. Despite the fact that 26 febrile patients were treated with empirical antifungal treatment, 28 of the 37 patients (76%) died from fungal infection at a median time of 17 d from the onset of clinical symptoms. Nine patients were cured by antifungal therapy plus, in five cases, radical surgery procedures. An analysis of factors influencing outcome demonstrated that the resolution of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and prolonged treatment with amphotericin B and, if feasible, radical surgical debridement treatment, were significantly correlated with recovery from infection. Mucormycosis, a rare filamentous fungal infection that occurs most frequently in neutropenic acute leukaemia patients, is characterized by a high mortality rate.

Interestingly 7/14 cell lines in the Fas-sensitive group were positive for FAP-1 mRNA expression. 8/12 cell lines in the Fas-refractory group did not express FAP-1 mRNA, but half of these cell lines were susceptible to tumour necrosis factor alpha-induced growth inhibition. These findings suggest that the presence or absence of FAP-1 mRNA expression did not always correlate with relative sensitivity of Fas-mediated growth inhibition.

Predictions of its secondary structure indicate that CT-1 belongs to a family of cytokines with a four-helical bundle structure, and sequence comparisons reveal a weak homology to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). Using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay with rat sympathetic neuron cultures, we find that CT-1 induces and suppresses the expression of the same set of neuropeptide and neurotransmitter synthetic enzyme mRNAs as do LIF and CNTF. In addition, the effects of CT-1 and LIF are not additive, and CT-1 does not require a GPI-linked component to mediate its actions. Our functional data confirm that CT-1 is a member of the neuropoietic cytokine family and suggest that the CT-1 receptor complex contains the gp130 signal transducing component.","['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125, U.S.A.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A consistent association with monoclonal Epstein-Barr virus infection in the tumour cell has been observed. These tumours are now regarded as putative NK cell lymphoma/leukemia. Pathologically, tumour cells show variable cytological appearances, with frequent angiocentricity and angioinvasion, associated with zonal necrosis. Clinically, most cases occur in the nasal area and upper aerodigestive tract. However, occurrence in non-nasal sites such as the skin, gastrointestinal tract and testis is also observed. A particularly aggressive form of NK lymphoma/leukemia presents fulminantly as disseminated disease sometimes with a leukemic phase. All types of NK lymphoma/leukemia have an extremely poor prognosis with a median survival of less than a year.

Corticosteroid or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) exposure induces AQP1 protein expression in MEL cells, and transcriptional regulation was investigated by transient transfections with Aqp1 promoter-reporter constructs. Dexamethasone induction is abrogated by deletion of two glucocorticoid response elements -0.5 kilobases (kb) from the transcription initiation site.

Similar changes are induced in cultured sympathetic neurons by sweat gland cells or by one of the following cytokines: leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), or cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). None of these is the sweat gland-derived differentiation activity. LIF, CNTF, and CT-1 act through the known receptors LIF receptor beta (LIFRbeta) and gp130 and well defined signaling pathways including receptor phosphorylation and STAT3 activation. Therefore, to determine whether the gland-derived differentiation activity was a member of the LIF/CNTF cytokine family, we tested whether it acted via these same receptors and signal cascades. Blockade of LIFRbeta inhibited the sweat gland differentiation activity in neuron/gland co-cultures, and extracts of gland-containing footpads stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of LIFRbeta and gp130. An inhibitor (CGX) of molecules that bind the CNTFRalpha, which is required for CNTF signaling, did not affect the gland-derived differentiation activity. Soluble footpad extracts induced the same changes in NBFL neuroblastoma cells as LIF and CNTF, including increased vasoactive intestinal peptide mRNA, STAT3 dimerization, and DNA binding, and stimulation of transcription from the vasoactive intestinal peptide cytokine-responsive element. Thus, the sweat gland-derived differentiation activity uses the same signaling pathway as the neuropoietic cytokines, and is likely to be a family member.","['Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",,"['NS023678/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS27514/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, the human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line was used to study the effects of quercetin on the growth, cell cycle, activities of cytosolic and membrane protein kinase C (PKC) and tyrosine protein kinase (TPK), and phosphoinositide production of the tumor cells. The results showed that quercetin inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of about 7.7 microM after 96 hr of treatment; when the concentration of quercetin was 10 microM, the percent inhibition on the growth of HL-60 cells was 17.1, 27.3, 40.1, and 52.7% after 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr of treatment, respectively. Flow cytometric analyses showed that quercetin caused an increase in cells in the G2/M phase and a decrease in cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle in a concentration-dependent manner; these effects were reversed when quercetin was removed from the culture medium. Quercetin strongly inhibited the activities of cytosolic PKC and membrane TPK from HL-60 cells in vitro, with IC50 values of about 30.9 and 20.1 microM, respectively, but did not affect membrane PKC or cytosolic TPK activity from HL-60 cells in vitro. Quercetin markedly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the production of phosphoinositides in intact HL-60 cells. The results provide evidence that the inhibitory effect of quercetin on the growth of HL-60 cells may be related to its inhibitory effects on PKC and/or TPK in vitro and/or on the production of phosphoinositides.","['Institute of Medical Biochemistry, Guangdong Medical College, Zhanjiang, P.R.

Treatment modalities reported include discontinuation of medication, debridement, and topical antibiotics. We report the successful split-thickness skin grafting of a hydroxyurea-related ankle ulceration after preoperative discontinuation of hydroxyurea treatment in a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia who had previously failed grafting while taking this medication. It is hoped that heightened awareness of the link between hydroxyurea and chronic, debilitating ankle ulcerations in patients with myeloproliferative disorders, as well as familiarity with reported treatments, will promote early diagnosis and aggressive management of these unique and relatively uncommon lesions.","['Division of Plastic Surgery, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that donor CD8-dependent graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects against EL4 (H-2(b)) leukemia/lymphoma can be preserved while GVHD is inhibited by IL-12 in this model. In mice in which IL-12 mediated a significant protective effect against GVHD, marked GVL effects of allogeneic T cells against EL4 were observed. GVL effects against EL4 depended on CD8-mediated alloreactivity, protection was not observed in recipients of either syngeneic (B10) or CD8-depleted allogeneic spleen cells. Furthermore, we analyzed IL-12-treated recipients of EL4 and A/J spleen cells which survived for more than 100 days. No EL4 cells were detected in these mice by flow cytometry, tissue culture, adoptive transfer, necropsies, or histologic examination. Both GVL effects and the inhibitory effect of IL-12 on GVHD were diminished by neutralizing anti-interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) monoclonal antibody. This study demonstrates that IL-12-induced IFN-gamma production plays a role in the protective effect of IL-12 against GVHD. Furthermore, IFN-gamma is involved in the GVL effect against EL4 leukemia, demonstrating that protection from CD4-mediated GVHD and CD8-dependent anti-leukemic activity can be provided by a single cytokine, IFN-gamma. These observations may provide the basis for a new approach to inhibiting GVHD while preserving GVL effects of alloreactivity.","['BMT Section, Transplantation Biology Research Center, Surgical Service, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02129, USA.']",,['R01 64912/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed a competitive hematopoietic repopulation assay in baboons to evaluate methods for improving gene transfer and have used this method to compare gene transfer rates for retroviral vectors having an envelope protein (pseudotype) from amphotropic murine retrovirus with similar vectors having an envelope protein derived from gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV). We hypothesized that vectors with a GALV pseudotype might perform better based on our previous work with cultured human hematopoietic cells. CD34(+) marrow cells from each of four untreated baboons were divided into two equal portions that were cocultivated for 48 hours with packaging cells producing equivalent titers of either amphotropic or GALV pseudotyped vectors containing the neo gene. The vectors contained small sequence differences to allow differentiation of cells genetically marked by the different vectors. Nonadherent and adherent cells from the cultures were infused into animals after they received a myeloablative dose of total body irradiation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for neo gene-specific sequences in colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage from cell populations used for transplant showed gene transfer rates of 2.7%, 7.1%, <15%, and 3.9% with the amphotropic vectors and 7.1%, 11.3%, <15%, and 26.4% with the GALV pseudotyped vector. PCR analysis of peripheral blood and marrow cells after engraftment showed the neo gene to be present in all four animals analyzed at levels between 0.1% and 5%. Overall gene transfer efficiency was higher with the GALVpseudotyped vector than with the amphotropic vectors. Southern blot analysis in one animal confirmed a gene transfer efficiency of between 1% and 5%. The higher gene transfer efficiency with the GALV-pseudotyped vector correlated with higher levels of GALV receptor RNA compared with the amphotropic receptor in CD34(+) hematopoietic cells. These results show that GALV-pseudotyped vectors are capable of transducing baboon marrow repopulating cells and may allow more efficient gene transfer rates for human gene therapy directed at hematopoietic cells. In addition, our data show considerable differences in gene transfer efficiency between individual baboons, suggesting that a competitive repopulation assay will be critical for evaluation of methods designed to improve gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells.","['Clinical Research and Molecular Medicine Divisions, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",,"['AI35191/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Liver function tests and ultrasonography were used to assess presence of liver disease. Patients were tested for antibody to HCV and for serum HCV-RNA at the end of chemotherapy and at the end of follow-up. At chemotherapy withdrawal, 56 patients (49%) were HCV-RNA positive, often without detectable anti-HCV, and in these cases, transaminase levels were more elevated during (P = .08) and after (P = .04) chemotherapy compared with HCV-RNA negative cases. Patients were then followed-up 13 to 27 years (mean, 17) after chemotherapy withdrawal. During this period, 38 initially anti-HCV negative patients seroconverted to anti-HCV and 17 initially anti-HCV positive cases lost reactivity. Forty patients were persistently HCV-RNA positive in serum, while 16 initially viremic patients became HCV-RNA negative during follow-up. At the end of the observation period, a persistent transaminase elevation was detected only in four HCV-RNA positive and anti-HCV positive cases, while no patient developed signs or symptoms of decompensated liver disease. Thus, hepatitis C was a frequent finding in long-term survivors after chemotherapy. It was associated with an atypical serologic profile and did not cause severe liver impairment over a period of 13 to 27 years.","['Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano, Department of Pediatric Hematology, S.

Recent studies have shown that terminal differentiation need not necessarily lead to the apoptotic demise of myeloid cells, while other studies have shown that induction of differentiation is associated with increased resistance to apoptosis-inducing agents, such as chemotherapy and gamma-irradiation. Such results are pertinent to the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, where differentiating agents and hemopoietic growth factors are being combined with chemotherapy to enhance response and limit toxicity. To elucidate the factors governing apoptosis in human AML blasts, we have studied the cytotoxic effect of idarubicin on HL60, U937 and KG1 cells, after incubation with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), 1, 25(OH)2 D3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF ). We show that prior incubation of human myeloid leukemic cells with ATRA or 1,25(OH)2 D3 induced resistance to idarubicin-induced apoptosis, which was modulated by coincubation with GM-CSF. The altered chemosensitivity of cells depended on the degree of G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest induced by incubation with ATRA, 1, 25(OH)2 D3, and GM-CSF and was independent of differentiation status or Bcl-2 oncoprotein expression. These findings suggest that cell-cycle arrest in human leukemic cells can be induced by exogenous agents and may promote drug resistance. Determining the mechanisms by which cell-cycle arrest is induced may permit understanding of the processes by which the cells escape cytotoxic drug-mediated apoptosis.","[""Department of Haematology, St Bartholomew's, London, United Kingdom.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases with 12p alterations had a much lower frequency of hyperdiploidy greater than 50 (7%) than did the ALL population in general, but these cases had a similar distribution of immunophenotype and similar 5-year event-free survival (70% +/- 5% SE v 64% +/- 2%, P = .64).

WTKit cells were able to grow in the presence of the human ligand for Kit, stem cell factor (SCF ), but displayed reduced growth and clonogenic potential in either SCF or GM-CSF compared with the parental cells in GM-CSF. In contrast, V816Kit cells grew without factor at a higher rate than the parental cells in GM-CSF and displayed increased clonogenicity. Dissection of the growth characteristics in liquid culture showed that in the presence of appropriate factors, the different populations had similar proliferation rates, but that V816Kit profoundly increased cell survival compared with WTKit or parental cells. This suggests that the signals transduced by WTKit activated with SCF, and by V816Kit, were not identical. Also, WTKit and V816Kit-expressing cells both varied from the early myeloid progenitor phenotype of the parental cells and gave rise to a small number of large to giant adherent cells that expressed macrophage (alpha-naphthyl acetate) esterase and neutrophil (naphtol-AS-D-chloroacetate) esterase, were highly phagocytic and phenotypically resembled histiocytes. Thus, WTKit activated by SCF and V816Kit were able to induce differentiation in a proportion of Myb-transformed myeloid cells. The factor independent V816Kit cells, unlike the parental and WTKit expressing cells, were shown to produce tumors of highly mitotic, invasive cells at various stages of differentiation in syngeneic mice. These results imply that constitutively activated Kit can promote the development of differentiated myeloid tumors and that its oncogenic effects are not restricted to lineages (mast cell and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia), which have been reported previously. Furthermore, the mixed populations of cells in culture and in the tumors phenotypically resembled the leukemic cells from patients with monocytic leukemia with histiocytic differentiation (acute myeloid leukemia-M5c), a newly proposed subtype of myeloid leukemia.","['Leukemia Research Unit and Division of Human Immunology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, South Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of the cells with flavopiridol (100 nmol/L to 400 nmol/L) led to a marked dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell growth and survival as determined using trypan blue exclusion. Morphologic analysis showed characteristic apoptotic changes such as chromatin condensation and fragmentation, membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies. Furthermore, quantitative assessment of apoptosis-associated DNA strand breaks by in situ TdT labeling showed that a significant number of flavopiridol-treated cells underwent apoptosis. These cellular effects were associated with a significant decrease in bcl-2 expression as observed by Northern and Western blotting. The results showed that flavopiridol downregulates bcl-2 mRNA and bcl-2 protein expression within 24 hours. Genistein and quercetin, two flavonoids that do not inhibit CDKs, did not affect bcl-2 expression. These data suggest an additional mechanism of action of this new flavone which might be useful as an agent in the treatment of chronic lymphoid malignancies.","['The Molecular Therapeutics Program, the Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA.']",,['CA67823-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

B cells that do not express B7 costimulatory molecules induce T-cell tolerance. Therefore, the expression of B7 costimulatory molecules on malignant B cells might be critical for their recognition by anti-tumor-specific T cells. Here we show that virtually all germinal center (GC)-derived B-cell lymphomas including follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large cell lymphoma, but not mantle cell lymphoma or small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLL/CLL), express B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) on their cell surface in situ, although at extremely low levels. Despite their expression of low levels of B7-1 and B7-2, FL cells could not induce significant allogeneic T-cell proliferation. However, B7 costimulatory molecules on FL appeared to be functional because they were capable of increasing T-cell proliferation of preactivated T cells in a secondary allogeneic mixed lymphocyte response. Moreover, low B7 expression was sufficient to prevent the induction of alloantigen-specific anergy in vitro. Therefore, we postulate that whereas low-level expression of B7 is not sufficient to initiate a productive antilymphoma T-cell response, it might be sufficient to prevent T-cell tolerance in vivo.","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA.""]",,['CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the responses of K562 cells and apoptosis-proficient HL-60 acute myelomonocytic leukemia cells to etoposide were compared, with particular emphasis on determining the long-term fate of the cells. When cells were treated with varying concentrations of etoposide for 1 hour and subsequently plated in soft agar, the two cell lines displayed similar sensitivities, with a 90% reduction in colony formation at 5 to 10 mu mol/L etoposide. After treatment with 17 mu mol/L etoposide for 1 hour, cleavage of the caspase substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic morphological changes were evident in HL-60 cells in less than 6 hours. After the same treatment, K562 cells arrested in G2 phase of the cell cycle but otherwise appeared normal for 3 to 4 days before developing similar apoptotic changes. When the etoposide dose was increased to 68 mu mol/L, apoptotic changes were evident in HL-60 cells after 2 to 3 hours, whereas the same changes were observed in K562 cells after 24 to 48 hours. This delay in the development of apoptotic changes in K562 cells was accompanied by delayed release of cytochrome c to the cytosol and delayed appearance of peptidase activity that cleaved the fluorogenic substrates Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminotrifluoromethylcoumarin (DEVD-AFC) and Val-Glu-Ile-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (VEID-AMC) as well as an altered spectrum of active caspases that were affinity labeled with N-(Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonylglutamyl-Nepsilon-biotin yllysyl) aspartic acid [(2,6-dimethylbenzoyl)oxy]methyl ketone [z-EK(bio)D-aomk]. On the other hand, the activation of caspase-3 under cell-free conditions occurred with indistinguishable kinetics in cytosol prepared from the two cell lines. Collectively, these results suggest that a delay in the signaling cascade upstream of cytochrome c release and caspase activation leads to a long latent period before the active phase of apoptosis is initiated in etoposide-treated K562 cells. Once the active phase of apoptosis is initiated, the spectrum and subcellular distribution of active caspase species differ between HL-60 and K562 cells, but a similar proportion of cells are ultimately killed in both cell lines.","['Institute of Cell & Molecular Biology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.']",,"['073915/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using ISH to open reading frame-72 (ORF 72), we localized KSHV to BM dendritic cells in 17 of 20 patients with myeloma, 2 patients with plasmacytosis associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and 1 case of aplastic anemia. In contrast, BM from normal subjects (n = 4) and patients with lymphoma and leukemia (n = 21) did not contain KSHV. PCR amplification with KSHV primers demonstrated product in fresh BM biopsy samples from 6 of 7 myeloma patients, whereas three normal marrows contained no amplified product. These findings suggest that KSHV, possibly through alterations in the BM microenvironment and production of viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6), may stimulate and maintain abnormal plasma cell proliferation in myeloma and related disorders.","['Departments of Pathology and Medicine, the Division of Hematology/Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, Veterans Affairs West Los Angeles Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['Blood. 1998 Nov 1;92(9):3488.

A clone with a t(5; 14)(q33; q32) translocation appeared at the relapse phase in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia who exhibited a sole chromosomal translocation, t(7; 11), at initial diagnosis. After the appearance of this clone, the leukemia progressed with marked eosinophilia, and combination chemotherapy was ineffective. Southern blot analysis showed a rearrangement of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta) gene at 5q33 which was not observed at initial diagnosis. This translocation resulted in a chimeric transcript fusing the PDGFRbeta gene on 5q33 with a novel gene, CEV14, located at 14q32. Expression of the 5' region of the PDGFRbeta cDNA, upstream of the breakpoint, was not detected. However, the 3' region of PDGFRbeta, which was transcribed as part of the CEV14-PDGFRbeta fusion gene, was detected. A partial cDNA for a novel gene, CEV14, includes a leucine zipper motif and putative thyroid hormone receptor interacting domain and is expressed in a wide range of tissues. The expression of a CEV14-PDGFRbeta fusion gene in association with aggressive leukemia progression suggests that this protein has oncogenic potential.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya; Mitsubishi Bioclinical Laboratory Inc, Tokyo.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, it has been shown that autonomous proliferation of blast cells in liquid culture was also predictive of poor prognosis. In a series of 72 adult AML cases at diagnosis, we studied by flow cytometry the expression of P170 and bcl-2 proteins, together with autonomous growth of leukemic cells in liquid culture. Cases were classified as exhibiting no proliferation (N = 29), intermediate proliferation (N = 25) and high proliferation (N = 18). We observed a significant correlation between the percentage of cells in each sample expressing P170 and bcl-2. This was confirmed by double staining techniques showing that both antigens were present in the same cells. We also observed a significant association between growth pattern and P170 or bcl-2 expression. All patients were treated by intensive chemotherapy including an anthracycline drug and cytarabine. The blasts of patients achieving complete remission (N = 47) were less frequently positive for CD34, P170 and bcl-2 than those from patients who did not. Growth pattern also influenced significantly CR. In univariate analysis, CD34, P170 and bcl-2 expression, as well as growth pattern, significantly influenced survival. However, in multivariate analysis P170 expression remained the only significant factor, bcl-2 (or proliferation) having no independent value. Our study confirms the prognostic value of P170 and bcl-2 expression as well as the value of spontaneous proliferation and suggests that several drug-resistance mechanisms are implicated concomitantly in AML.","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital Nord, CHRU de St Etienne, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some patients with ATL show multiple HTLV-I integrations and exhibit clinical characteristics unlike those of ATL patients who show the typical integration of a single provirus. Multiple HTLV-I integrations can be detected by Southern blotting as multiple bands having varied intensities. These multiple integration conditions can arise from one tumor cell clone carrying multiple copies of the provirus, or from multiple cell clones, each carrying one copy of the provirus. The former patients manifest an extremely aggressive clinical course with the infiltration of unusual organs such as the retina and uvea. The latter patients show an indolent clinical course with skin lesions. These findings suggest that the clinical implications for multiple HTLV-I integrations exist in ATL. This may be one of the explanations for the heterogeneous findings in the disease. Such observations may provide information linking viral integration with clinical manifestations, and improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of ATL.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Saga Medical School, Nabeshima, Japan.']",,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the biological functions displayed by these two molecules overlap to some extent, they are produced by different cell types and bind to distinct receptorial structures. Both cytokines transduce signals through the beta (p75) and gamma (p64) chains of the IL-2R system, but IL-15, like IL-2, binds to its own specific alpha chain, referred to as IL-15Ralpha. Similarly to IL-2, IL-15 is able to trigger both the proliferation and immunoglobulin production by normal B-lymphocytes. These biological functions may be acquired however only when B-cells have been preactivated in vitro with polyclonal mitogens, or alternatively, when they are cultured in association with other stimuli. By contrast, leukemic cells from patients with chronic B-cell malignancies, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hairy cell leukemia, proliferate to IL-15 regardless of in vitro preactivation. This peculiar IL-15 responsiveness distinguishes malignant B-cells from normal B-lymphocytes. Furthermore, the proliferation elicited by IL-15 in B-CLL and HCL is mainly related to the presence of the beta and gamma chains of the IL-2R system on malignant B-lymphocytes.","['Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Vicenza Hospital, Padova, Italy.']",,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we demonstrated that one of the target cells of 1,25(OH)2D3 in Mo/Mphi differentiation is the neutrophilic promyelocyte that is believed to belong to the neutrophilic lineage. This fact overthrows the established theory that normal hematopoietic precursors are committed to respective cell lineages and do not deviate from their own lineage. The lineage switching from the promyelocyte to Mo/Mphi was suggested to be operating in vivo because 1,25(OH)2D3 is a physiological substance produced by Mphi. More recently, we have shown that transient exposure (24 h) of promyelocytes to 1,25(OH)2D3 causes Mo/Mphi differentiation. This strategy could be useful for examining the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on the growth and differentiation of normal myeloblasts and myeloid progenitor cells. Recent advances in molecular biology have enabled investigators to identify a number of genes involved in Mo/Mphi differentiation induced by 1,25(OH)2D3. Some of these may be the determinant genes for Mo/Mphi differentiation; however, further studies are required to determine the underlying mechanisms of Mo/Mphi differentiation.","['Department of Immuno-Hematology, Kobe City General Hospital, Japan.']",,,59,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children with ALL had just been diagnosed with the disease and had received no therapy prior to obtaining blood samples. A multitude of typical hydroxyl radical-induced base lesions in lymphocyte DNA of children were identified and quantified by gas chromatography-isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Higher levels of DNA base lesions were observed in patients with ALL than in children without the disease. The levels of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase in lymphocytes of ALL patients were lower than in lymphocytes of controls. These findings are in agreement with earlier observations in various types of adulthood cancer. Some of the identified DNA base lesions are known to possess premutagenic properties and may play a role in carcinogenesis. The results may indicate a possible link between decreased activities of antioxidant enzymes and increased levels of DNA base lesions due to oxidative damage, and support the notion that free radical reactions may be increased in malignant cells.","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Osman Gazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival was not enhanced by known trophic factors (ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, neurotrophin-3) for differentiating rat OCs. In medium conditioned by neonatally derived rat or wt mouse astrocytes, however, wt OBs survived terminal OC differentiation, expressing first GalC, then DM-20/PLP on their surface 1-2 days later, before elaborating myelin-like membrane. By contrast, jp OBs in sister cultures survived differentiation initially as well as their normal counterparts did but rapidly died thereafter, beginning at the time when PLP/DM-20 immunoreactivity became detectable on premature wt GalC+ OCs. Additionally under these conditions, there survived a minor population (<5%) of jp cells, including mature OCs, which expressed stunted membranes and DM-20/PLP immunoreactivity in their cytoplasm, and undifferentiated progenitors.

In this review, a brief overview of tumor radiobiology as well as various obstacles to treatment is presented. Early radiolabeled antibody trials documented myelosuppression as the dose-limiting toxicity. Ongoing trials in solid tumors and hematologic malignancies are testing the hypothesis that myeloablative doses of radiation in conjunction with hematopoietic stem cell rescue will improve long-term survival. For solid tumors, there are many barriers to achieving this goal. The most encouraging trials in metastatic breast cancer have documented significant symptomatic relief and a 50% partial response in patients. In contrast, trials involving hematologic malignancies have produced more impressive results. With a median follow-up of 33 months, 67% of patients with recurrent acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplasia treated with radiolabeled antibodies, total-body irradiation, and high-dose chemotherapy remain disease free. Alone, myeloablative doses of radioimmunotherapy have documented a 41% complete response in patients with Hodgkin's disease. Seattle trials with recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have demonstrated objective responses in 90% of patients, complete responses in 85% of patients, a progression-free survival of 62%, and an overall survival of 93% with a median follow-up of 2 years.","['Division of Medical Oncology, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle 98195-6043, USA.']",,['P01CA44991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],64,,,,,,,,,,,,

The graft-versus-leukemia effect was initially considered to be a minor component of the graft-versus-host reaction. However, more recent analyses of clinical bone marrow transplants and the successful treatment of relapsed leukemia with donor lymphocyte transfusions indicate that the graft-versus-leukemia effect can be very powerful and to some degree independent of graft-versus-host disease. Results of donor lymphocyte transfusions draw attention to wide variability in response according to the nature of the relapsed leukemia and also to additional therapies that may enhance the efficacy of donor lymphocyte transfusions. Although natural killer lymphocytes may play a role in the graft-versus-leukemia effect, attention is focusing increasingly on T lymphocytes as potent mediators of the effect. Both CD4+ and CD8+ cells, together with the cytokines they produce, can interact with leukemia cells to deliver a cytotoxic hit on the malignant clone. Although leukemia cells undoubtedly share common antigens with other tissues of the recipient resulting in nonspecific graft-versus-host and graft-versus-leukemia reactions, there is also the possibility that distinct antigens are presented to T cells by the leukemia cells, providing a basis for separating the graft-versus-leukemia from graft-versus-host reactions. The current clinical challenge is to devise strategies for separating the graft-versus-leukemia response from graft-versus-host disease.","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",,,73,,,,,,,,,,,,

The greater HLA incompatibility, which, although present, was undetected until recently in many unrelated donor BMT cases, has resulted in a higher rate of posttransplant complications and impaired acturial survival when compared with HLA-matched sibling BMT. Molecular HLA typing enables us to evaluate the impact of incompatibility at each locus in the outcome of unrelated donor BMT. The overall retrospective data would recommend that HLA-A, -B and -C allelic molecular matching should be implemented in addition to HLA-DR allelic matching. Further retrospective analysis is needed in order to assess which incompatibility or combinations are better tolerated than others. Only the definitive knowledge at the sequence level of the donor and the recipient HLA allelic diversity involved in controlling the allogeneic immune response will allow us to understand the precise biologic rationale of the graft-versus-host disease. Knowledge and control of the HLA incompatibilities should allow us to offset the detrimental effects of histoincompatibility while developing strategies to take advantage of the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia effect. Also the role of minor histocompatibility antigens remains largely unknown and will require careful evaluation before minor antigens can be used as a selection criterion in BMT. Carefully designed prospective studies will enable us to test the impact of each HLA locus.

These side effects include the development of refractoriness to transfusions, alloimmunization, transfusion reactions, the transmission of infectious agents, and transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease. Leukodepletion by filtration is promising as a means of preventing the development of alloimmunization. Results of the Trial to Reduce Alloimmunization to Platelets will be reported shortly and will shed more light on that issue. Bedside filtration of cellular blood products also diminishes the transmission of cytomegalovirus infections by that route. Transfusion reactions are often mediated by cytokines in the plasma fraction of transfused platelet concentrates, and leukodepletion prior to storage reduces their incidence. Serious bacterial infections are sometimes transmitted by platelet transfusions and improved methods are needed for their detection and prevention.

Factors that influence a marker's true prognostic value include several variables of study design: study size, uniform versus nonuniform patient treatment, methodologic variations, and correlations with other variables. Despite these concerns, several important prognostic factors have emerged in acute leukemias. For example, in acute myeloid leukemia, the multidrug resistant phenotype, whether conferred by the classic P-glycoprotein (multidrug resistance protein 1) or by other mechanisms, and cytogenetics are major prognostic indicators for outcome. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, markers associated with loss of growth control (loss of tumor suppressor genes, increased proliferative fraction) likewise identify a group of poor-prognosis patients.

Rather, careful consideration must be taken of the context of the type of disease, the molecular lesion itself, and the type of therapy employed. Thus although the detection of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute promyelocytic leukemia has a high correlation with relapse, detection of minimal residual disease in t(8;21) acute myelogenous leukemia has little correlation with relapse. In some diseases (eg. chronic myeloid leukemia) the clinical relevance of minimal residual disease detection may be strengthened by quantification, although this in itself introduces another level of complexity and potential pitfalls.

Chemotherapy forms the mainstay of treatment for acute myeloblastic leukemia. In the past year, groups reported on the value of dose intensification in patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia under the age of 60 years and on the role of intensive chemotherapy combined with growth factors in the treatment of elderly patients. Similarly, the role of autologous bone marrow transplantation for older patients has been studied. Improvements in the treatment of patients with acute leukemia are likely to come from a recognition and understanding of the biologic attributes of the leukemic cell. Failure to cure leukemia is likely due to failure to eradicate the leukemic clone. Mechanisms of drug resistance acting before the drug reaches its target (proximal resistance) and after the drug interacts with its target (distal resistance) are gaining greater importance in understanding treatment failures. Advances have been made in identifying new mechanisms that are involved in proximal as well as distal drug resistance. Genetic changes both at the cytogenetic and the molecular level identify different FAB subgroups and groups of patients with good and bad prognostic features. Finally, reports are reviewed of two new factors that stimulate the growth of acute myeloblastic leukemia cells (thrombopoietin and Flt3 ligand) and a factor that inhibits the autocrine growth characteristics of acute myeloblastic leukemia cells (interleukin-10). The results of these interface and basic studies offer the hope of identifying groups of patients with different therapeutic needs and suggest ways to develop therapies aimed at the biology of the leukemic cell.","['Division of Hematology, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,,39,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, specific genetic rearrangements can be identified in as many as 50% of children with either acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia. The genes p16 (or MTS1) and TEL/AML1 are now respectively recognized as the most common tumor suppressor and fusion genes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Increasingly, contemporary protocols for the acute leukemias are relying on genetic information to guide treatment decisions. Examples include the use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the BCR-ABL fusion gene or MLL rearrangement, and for acute myeloid leukemia with monosomy 7; antimetabolite-based therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases with hyperdiploidy of more than 50 chromosomes (DNA index > or = 1.16); and retinoic acid and anthracycline-containing regimens for the acute promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia subtype with PML-RARA fusion. Other efforts are being made to reduce the long-term sequelae of treatment. Indeed, extended intrathecal therapy and intensive systemic chemotherapy will, in all likelihood, replace cranial irradiation as subclinical central nervous system therapy for patients with intermediate-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and perhaps even for those with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The challenge now is to identify specific treatments for other genetically defined subtypes of leukemia.

Recombinant mpl ligands based on this gene have been extensively evaluated in preclinical studies and are now in the early stages of clinical development. In vivo studies have confirmed that c-mpl ligand is a lineage-dominant cytokine and is the primary physiologic regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis. Recombinant mpl ligands can substantially reduce the severity and duration of thrombocytopenia due to myelosuppressive irradiation, chemotherapy, or both. Moreover, when recombinant mpl ligand is used in combination with r-metHuG-CSF, both thrombocytopenia and neutropenia can be prevented to the same degree as with either cytokine alone. In normal animals, the platelets produced in response to recombinant mpl ligand function appropriately and should not pose an undue risk for thrombosis when administered to thrombocytopenic patients. Initial clinical data confirm the safety and biologic activity of these new agents in humans. Clinical development will likely target the most myelosuppressive regimens, including those used in hematopoietic cell transplantation and acute myelocytic leukemia. Ultimately, the clinical benefit of these drugs will likely be judged on their ability to reduce the duration of severe thrombocytopenia and the need for platelet transfusions.","['Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320-1789, USA.']",,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies indicate that use of unpurged autologous blood or marrow grafts may extend survival for patients undergoing transplantation in chronic phase. Ex vivo or in vivo purging of chronic myelogenous leukemia marrow or blood prior to autografting may result in increased cytogenetic remissions after transplantation in those patients in whom the Ph+ clone can be eliminated. However, when the Ph+ clone cannot be eliminated, use of purged rather than unpurged autografts provides no advantage and may be associated with increased graft failure. Although sustained cytogenetic remissions have not been observed, autografting may result in a plateau in the survival curve not observed with conventional chemotherapy.

It has been disappointing in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in advanced stages of chronic myelogenous leukemia. In chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia remissions were of good quality and the actuarial relapse rate was less than 20% at 3 years. In acute leukemias remissions were less durable. Graft-versus-host disease and marrow aplasia were the major complications of this form of treatment. In patients with marrow aplasia hematopoiesis could be restored by infusion of donor marrow without further conditioning treatment.

In high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia, trials also reported a reduction in the incidence of documented infections and early mortality rate. Thus in elderly patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and in high-risk patients with acute myelogenous leukemia the use of hematopoietic growth factors seems justified. Whether the rate of infections, particularly of life-threatening fungal infections, can be reduced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor after chemotherapy cannot be known without larger studies. A novel strategy in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia is the attempt to increase the growth fraction of clonal leukemic cells prior to administration of chemotherapeutic agents by the administration of hematopoietic growth factors. Evidence shows that hematopoietic growth factors enhance anti-leukemic activity of cytosine arabinoside against leukemic cells by recruitment of leukemic cells into cell cycle, an increase of intracellular cytosine arabinoside triphosphate:deoxcytidine 5' triphosphate pool ratios, or by an enhanced cytosine arabinoside incorporation into the DNA of acute myelogenous leukemia blasts. Whether these mechanisms lead to an increase in the complete remission rate and eventually to an improvement in survival must be answered in ongoing larger acute myelogenous leukemia trials using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in such a setting.","['Klinikum der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt, Germany.']",,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,

The generation of mature blood cells from these pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells involves the highly regulated progression through successive stages involving commitment to a specific cell lineage, terminal differentiation of lineage-restricted progenitors, and growth arrest. Although the differentiation commitment of stem cells may be intrinsically determined, it is apparent that a wide variety of external and internal stimuli can influence and modulate lineage choice and differentiation. These factors cooperate with cellular transcription factors to activate or repress the expression of genes responsible for lineage choice, diverse mature phenotypes, and cell cycle progression.

By analogy to progress in other developmental systems, such as muscle and liver cell differentiation, it should be possible to establish a hierarchy of differentiation signals and transcriptional processes for developing myeloid cells. Current research centers on the cooperation between tissue-specific and more widely expressed transcription factors in the stage-specific regulation of genes essential to myelopoiesis. An attractive emerging concept implicates the programmed regulation of key transcription factors at different stages of development, coordinated by receptor-mediated signals from myeloid colony-stimulating factors. In addition, molecular studies of genes adjacent to the breakpoints of chromosomal translocations in the myeloid leukemias have begun to clarify how aberrantly activated transcription factors can disrupt normal developmental programs and contribute to malignant transformation.","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",,"['P01-CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA 42804/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",73,,,,,,,,,,,,

Labelling of U937 cells with [32P]Pi, followed by immunoprecipitation of C3 from cell lysates and culture supernatants at different time points, showed that C3 was phosphorylated intracellularly immediately before release into the medium, which initiated cleavage of the protein into an iC3b-like fragment. Stimulation of CD11b/CD18 increased phosphorylation 7-fold, from a basal level of 2%. The phosphorylation sites in C3 did not resemble those described previously for casein kinase (CK) 1, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A or calcium- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C. Instead, protein kinase CK2 was suggested inasmuch as: (1) CK2 was detected both on the cell surface and on shed microparticles; (2) phosphorylation of purified C3 by microparticles was abolished by a monoclonal antibody, anti-CK2; (3) the [32P]Pi tag of both phosphorylated C3 (secreted from U937 cells) and of microparticle-phosphorylated C3, which was cleaved either by membrane proteases or by leucocyte elastase, was found in a 40 and a 70 kDa polypeptide; (4) both secreted C3 and C3 phosphorylated in vitro were much more susceptible to cleavage by proteases. Generation of C3 fragments provides a means by which U937 cells can stimulate nearby cells which are expressing complement receptors.

The most common type of malignancy associated with FeLV is T-cell lymphoma. SL3-3 (SL3) is a potent T-cell lymphomagenic murine leukemia virus. Transcriptional enhancer sequences within the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of SL3 and other murine retroviruses are crucial genetic determinants of the pathogenicities of these viruses. The LTR enhancer sequences of FeLV contain identical binding sites for some of the transcription factors that are known to affect the lymphomagenicity of SL3. To test whether the FeLV LTR contains a genetic determinant of lymphomagenicity, a recombinant virus that contained the U3 region of a naturally occurring FeLV isolate, LC-FeLV, linked to the remainder of the genome of SL3 was generated. When inoculated into mice, the recombinant virus induced T-cell lymphomas nearly as quickly as SL3. Moreover, the U3 sequences of LC-FeLV were found to have about half as much transcriptional activity in T lymphocytes as the corresponding sequences of SL3. This level of activity was severalfold higher than that of the LTR of weakly leukemogenic Akv virus. Thus, the FeLV LTR contains a potent genetic determinant of T-cell lymphomagenicity. Presumably, it is adapted to be recognized by transcription factors present in T cells of cats, and this yields a relatively high level of transcription that allows the enhancer to drive the requisite steps in the process of lymphomagenesis.","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",,"['CA09060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC230290,,,,,,,,,,

We compared levels of expression in PA317 fibroblasts, F9 (EC) cells, and CCE (ES) cells by Mo-MuLV-based vectors and vectors based on our previously reported MND backbone, which has alterations to address three viral elements implicated as repressors of expression by Mo-MuLV: the enhancer, the primer binding site, and the negative-control region. Expression was evaluated with three reporter genes, the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene, whose expression was measured by enzymatic assay and by Northern blotting; a truncated nerve growth factor receptor (tNGFR), whose expression was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) as a cell surface protein; and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), whose expression was measured intracellularly by flow cytometry. We found significantly higher levels of CAT activity (5- to 300-fold) and greater quantities of vector-specific transcripts in ES and EC cells transduced with the modified MND-CAT-SN vector than in those transduced with L-CAT-SN. Northern blot analysis indicated that long terminal repeat transcripts from MND-CAT-SN are >80 times more abundant than the L-CAT-SN transcripts. FACS analysis of tNGFR expression from a pair of vectors, L-tNGFR-SN and MND-tNGFR-SN, indicated that only 1.04% of the CCE cells containing the L-tNGFR-SN vector expressed the cell surface reporter, while the MND-tNGFR-SN vector drove expression in 99.54% of the CCE cells. Of the F9 cells containing the L-tNGFR-SN vector, 13.32% expressed tNGFR, while 99.89% of the F9 cells transduced with MND-tNGFR-SN showed expression. Essentially identical results were produced with an analogous pair of vectors encoding EGFP. In unselected pools of F9 cells 48 h posttransduction, the L-EGFP-SN vector drove expression in only 5% of the population while the MND-EGFP-SN vector drove expression in 88% of the cells. After more than 3 weeks in culture without selection, the proportion of cells showing expression from L-EGFP-SN decreased slightly to 3% while expression from the MND-EGFP-SN vector persisted in 80% of the cells. Interestingly, in the few ES and EC cells which did show expression from the L-tNGFR-SN or L-EGFP-SN vectors, the magnitude of reporter expression was similar to that from the MND-tNGFR-SN or MND-EGFP-SN vector in nearly all cells, suggesting that the MND vectors are far less susceptible to position-dependent variegation of expression than are the Mo-MuLV-based vectors. Therefore, the modified retroviral vector, MND, achieves higher net levels of expression due to a greater frequency of expression, which may be useful for the expression of exogenous genes in EC and ES cells.","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, USA.']",,"['CA59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK4900/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC230252,,,,,,,,,,

However, FeLV-B and A-MLV use different sodium-dependent phosphate symporters, Pit1 and Pit2, respectively, as receptors for infection. Pit1 and Pit2 are predicted to have 10 membrane-spanning domains and five extracellular loops. The close relationship of the retroviral envelopes enabled us to generate pseudotype virions carrying chimeric FeLV-B/A-MLV envelope glycoproteins. We found that some of the pseudotype viruses could not use Pit1 or Pit2 proteins but could efficiently utilize specific chimeric Pit1/Pit2 proteins as receptors. By studying Mus dunni tail fibroblasts expressing chimeric Pit1/Pit2 proteins and pseudotype virions carrying chimeric FeLV-B/A-MLV envelopes, we show that FeLV-B and A-MLV VRA and VRB interact in a modular manner with specific receptor domains. Our results suggest that FeLV-B VRA interacts with Pit1 extracellular loops 4 and 5 and that residues Phe-60 and Pro-61 of FeLV-B VRA are essential for receptor choice. However, this interaction is insufficient for infection, and an additional interaction between FeLV-B VRB and Pit1 loop 2 is essential. Similarly, A-MLV infection requires interaction of A-MLV VRA with Pit2 loops 4 and 5 and VRB with Pit2 loop 2, with residues Tyr-60 and Val-61 of A-MLV VRA being critical for receptor recognition. Together, our results suggest that FeLV-B and A-MLV infections require two major discrete interactions between the viral SU envelope glycoproteins and their respective receptors.

Early diagnosis depends primarily on morphological recognition. The French-American-British (FAB) classification, however, does not describe all morphological variations that occur in APL. In 25 cases with evidence of APL confirmed by cytogenetic and/or molecular analysis, we found a heterogeneous morphological group. The most common form of APL was heterogeneous and consisted of various combinations of cells in which hypergranular cells and some cells with multiple Auer rods were obvious. In some cases, one cell predominated. This led to the description of five subcategories. These included the classical FAB M3 with hypergranular cells and multiple Auer rods; the FAB variant with hypogranular bilobed cells; the basophilic cell type of McKenna et al. [Br. J. Haematol 50:201, 1982]; and two additional subtypes, one consisting of differentiated promyelocytes and a few blast cells (M2-like), and the other consisting largely of blast cells and a few early promyelocytes (M1-like). Immunophenotyping revealed a pattern of CD33 and/or CD13 positivity, and CD14 and HLA-DR negativity in 96% of cases. CD2 was positive in the FAB variant and in the subtype with basophilic cells, but negative with other subtypes. Three out of five cases with basophilic cell predominance [McKenna et al.: Br J Haematol 50:201, 1982], and one out of two M2-like cases, responded to ATRA therapy. Awareness of the heterogeneity and the atypical morphologic subtypes found in t(15;17) APL will contribute to improved recognition and early institution of ATRA therapy.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation, Ontario, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A rationale for the use of sequential therapy involving the combination of camptothecins with topoisomerase II-targeting drugs, such as etoposide, has arisen from observations of increased topoisomerase II protein levels in cell lines resistant to camptothecin. In an effort to understand potential mechanisms of resistance to this strategy, we developed a U-937 cell subline, denoted RERC, that is capable of surviving exposure to sequential topoisomerase poisoning. The RERC cells are 200-fold resistant to camptothecin, 8-fold resistant to etoposide, and 10-fold hypersensitive to cisplatin compared to the parental U-937 cells. Biochemical analyses indicate that the resistant phenotype involves alterations in both topoisomerase I and topoisomerase IIalpha. Topoisomerase I catalytic activity in the resistant cells is similar to that of the parental line but is resistant to camptothecin. Moreover, the resistant cells express a single mRNA species of topoisomerase I that codes for a mutation in codon 533. In addition, topoisomerase IIalpha protein levels are decreased 10-fold in the resistant line, coincident with a two-fold decrease in the expression of topoisomerase IIalpha mRNA. Collectively, these results indicate that resistance to sequential topoisomerase poisoning may involve a reduction in total cellular topoisomerase activity.","['Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Brunswick 08901, USA.']",,"['CA70981/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

They can transpose via the reverse transcription of mRNA into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) followed by the insertion of this dsDNA into new sites within the host genome. The unintegrated, linear, dsDNA form of retrotransposons is usually very rare. We report here the isolation of a retrotransposon from Candida albicans which is unusual in this respect. This element, which we have named pCal, was first identified as a distinct band when uncut C. albicans DNA was examined on an agarose gel. Sequence analysis of the cloned element revealed that it is a retrotransposon belonging to the Ty1/copia group. It is estimated that pCal produces 50 to 100 free, linear, dsDNA copies of itself per cell. This is a much higher level of expression than even that of the system in which Ty1 is expressed behind the highly active GAL1 promoter on a high-copy-number plasmid (about 10 copies per cell). Another unusual feature of pCal is that its Pol enzymes are likely to be expressed via the pseudoknot-assisted suppression of an upstream, in-phase stop codon, as has been shown for Moloney murine leukemia virus.","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.']",,,,['GENBANK/AF007776'],PMC179655,,,,,,,,,,

In these malignancies a combination of lymphoma and leukemia is commonly seen at presentation and most patients are treated according to protocols for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). These protocols are often designed for the majority of ALL cases, i.e., progenitor-B-ALL. In pediatric lymphoblastic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma without bone marrow infiltration various protocols have been used. The most frequently reported regimens show variable survival rates between 40 and 75%. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1989 we have treated 32 consecutive patients with T-cell malignancies, irrespective of localization, with a protocol consisting of a 4-agent induction treatment followed by high doses of methotrexate, and cytosine-arabinoside and intensified bleomycin, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vin cristin, prednisone (BACOP) courses. Treatment duration for each patient was 1 year. Twenty-one of the 32 patients had stage IV disease. Follow-up ranged from 1.6 to 7.6 years (median 4.2 years). RESULTS: Overall event-free survival (EFS) was 72%, while in those with stage IV disease it was 67%. No therapy-related deaths occurred. Neither stage, initial leukocyte value, mediastinal involvement, bone marrow involvement, nor the presence of CD1, CD3, CD4, CD8, or CD10 epitopes was prognostically significant. Evaluation of toxicity revealed a minimal decrease of carbon monoxide diffusion and cardiac shortening fraction. CONCLUSION: A relatively short but intensive chemotherapy can be used in T-cell malignancies. The EFS is satisfying, but larger studies are needed.","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Kinderziekenhuis AMC, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,['Med Pediatr Oncol 1998 May;30(5):318'],,,,,

Additional investigations regarding the effects of the use of leukocyte-reduced blood components were reported during the past year. A recent study in patients with hematologic malignancy that employed the commonly used bedside leukocyte-reduction filters failed to confirm a decrease in the rate of alloimmunization, except in a subgroup of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Another major multicenter trial confirmed the effectiveness of leukocyte-reduced blood components in the prevention of cytomegalovirus infection. The effect of allogeneic leukocytes in transfused blood on immune function in patients undergoing colorectal surgery continues to receive attention. Whereas one study failed to demonstrate an adverse effect of standard blood components on disease recurrence or survival, a second study demonstrated a marginally significant decrease in infectious complications in patients who received only leukocyte-reduced blood. Increasingly efficient leukocyte-reduction filters have been developed for cellular blood components, many of which are best suited for laboratory filtration of unstored blood. Laboratory studies indicate that prestorage leukocyte-reduction of cellular blood components does not impair erythrocyte or platelet function and will not increase the incidence of microbial contamination of blood.

Compound 4e [(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-2-yl)carbonyl-Leu-D,L-Phe-CH2F+ ++], having a tetrahydroisoquinoline containing urea as the N-terminal capping group, is the most potent dipeptide fluoromethyl ketone inhibitor of calpain I (with a second-order rate constant for inactivation of 276,000 M-1 s-1) yet reported; tripeptide 4k (Cbz-Leu-Leu-D,L-Phe-CH2F) is equipotent. A number of compounds presented in this study displayed excellent selectivity for calpain I over cathepsins B and L, two related cysteine proteases. Compounds which exhibited good inhibitory activity in the assay against isolated rh calpain I also inhibited intracellular calpain I in a human cell line. Thus, in an intact cell assay, compounds 4e and 4k inhibited calpain I with IC50 values of 0.2 and 0.1 microM, respectively. Finally, we also disclose the first example of fluorination of a dipeptide enol silyl ether to generate the corresponding dipeptide fluoromethyl ketone.","['Department of Chemistry, Cephalon, Inc., West Chester, Pennsylvania 19380-4245, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some groups of malignant lymphoma, including peripheral T-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease, are characterized by a conspicuous proliferation of small vessels. To test the hypothesis that VEGF may also be involved in the angiogenesis in lymphomas and other lesions of the lymphoid system, VEGF expression was analysed in tissues, employing in situ hybridization with a 35S-labelled RNA probe specific for this cytokine. Significant expression of VEGF transcripts was observed in Hodgkin's disease and peripheral T-cell lymphomas, particularly of the angioimmunoblastic type. In contrast, expression of this cytokine was minimal or absent in follicle centre lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell type. VEGF was mainly observed in reactive non-lymphoid CD68-negative cells, which probably represent fibroblasts or myofibroblasts. In normal and ulcerated tonsils, VEGF was expressed in the squamous epithelium but only rarely found in the lymphoid tissue. Although infectious mononucleosis tonsils contained high numbers of VEGF-positive cells in the interfollicular zone, expression of this cytokine was not found in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected cells, as determined by simultaneous in situ hybridization for VEGF and EBV-encoded small nuclear RNAs (EBER). In 5/8 cases of Castleman's disease, germinal centres containing small vessels also showed expression of VEGF, in contrast to normal tonsillar germinal centres which are devoid of both vessels and VEGF transcripts. It is concluded that VEGF may be involved in the induction of the angiogenesis of both peripheral T-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease, but not in low-grade B-cell lymphomas. In contradistinction to solid tumours, in which this cytokine is commonly secreted by the tumour cells themselves, in malignant lymphoma VEGF is not a product of neoplastic cells. Vascularization of germinal centres in Castleman's disease may also be a consequence of abnormal local expression of VEGF.","['Institute of Pathology, Klinikum Benjamin Franklin, Free University of Berlin, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has acute and delayed toxic effects on several tissues, possibly related to peroxidation processes and exhaustion of antioxidants. Early studies indicated an increase of peroxide processes and a decrease of antioxidants during conditioning therapy. Hence, we investigated the effect of antioxidant supplementation on peroxidation processes and antioxidant status. We supplemented a patient group (N = 16) [BMT (+)], with oral 45 mg beta-carotene, 825 mg alpha-tocopherol and 450 mg ascorbic acid daily for three weeks before conditioning therapy. Another patient group (N = 10), BMT(-), was not supplemented with antioxidants before conditioning therapy. In order to investigate the physiologic effect of supplement antioxidants a healthy control group (N = 10) was supplemented with the same doses as BMT(+). Peroxide concentrations in plasma were measured by using the cholesterol oxidase (CHOD)-iodide method and antioxidants were measured by HPLC. Before supplementation the beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol concentrations were comparable in both patient groups. After supplementation significantly higher beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol concentrations were measured in the supplemented patients, BMT(+), than in the unsupplemented patients, BMT(-). After conditioning therapy, BMT(+) patients showed a significantly higher beta-carotene concentration (p < 0.05) than before supplementation. In BMT(-) patients the beta-carotene (p < 0.05) and alpha-tocopherol concentrations (p < 0.01) decreased significantly and the lipid peroxide concentration increased significantly following conditioning therapy. We conclude that antioxidant supplementation prior to conditioning therapy reduces peroxidation processes induced by conditioning therapy in bone marrow recipients.","['Krankenanstalt Mutterhaus der Borromaerinnen, Trier, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The father of nuclear medicine, Dr J. H. Lawrence, pioneered their use in a range of disease states and found that radio-isotopes were of enormous value in the diagnosis and treatment of haemopoetic disease, particularly the myeloproliferative disorders. Radioactive phosphorus 32P emerged as the radio-isotope of choice for the myelosuppressive treatment of myeloproliferative disorders. This article also describes the use of radio-isotopes in the treatment of other disorders: chronic myeloid leukaemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and myeloma, work that is now largely forgotten. All myeloproliferative disorders may evolve without treatment into myelodysplastic syndrome or blast-cell transformation. It is accepted that life is prolonged in myeloproliferative disorders treated with 32P or alkylating agents, yet both are leukaemogenic.

This article defines those disorders that are not purely reactive, and describes in detail the diagnosis and features of clonal eosinophilic disorders and the hypereosinophilic syndrome. The clonal disorders that are associated with eosinophilia are discussed, in particular the acute and chronic eosinophilic leukaemias and clonal eosinophilias in association with acute myeloid leukaemia, myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes. Whether eosinophilia is produced by a clonal or reactive disorder, the end result can often be the same, i.e. end organ damage produced by sustained hypereosinophilia in the presence of eosinophil activation. When no cause for the eosinophilia leading to the end organ damage is found, this disease is termed 'idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome'. Its pathogenesis, clinical features and management are discussed with particular reference to the possibility of it being a T-cell-associated disorder.","['Royal Berkshire & Battle NHS Trust, Reading, UK.']",,,234,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell is apparently stuck in G0 in cell cycle, yet expresses many activation markers. The cells apparently manufacture many cytokines and respond in vitro to even more, yet cells entering even G1 are few. The cell surface marker profile is unique. There is apparently no normal equivalent of the CLL cell. In part, this may be because the cell is malignant; malignant cells often express aberrant markers. Consistent chromosomal abnormalities are emerging but we have no idea how these abnormalities translate into molecular mistakes that dictate the peculiar nature of the cell. CLL cells carry a characteristics set of adhesion molecules, but we cannot read their homing and recycling instructions. The outstanding irregularities of the CLL cell are its CD5 positivity and its sparse surface immunoglobulin. This ought to translate as an anergic B1 cell, perhaps programmed for autoimmunity. If the tumour cell were responsible for the patient's production of immunoglobulin or secretion of autoantibodies, then a pattern might have emerged. Alas, these are the product of the normal B cells. How the CLL cell induces these complications is unknown. Thus, despite the information contained in this review, the CLL cell remains a puzzle.","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital.']",,,124,,,,,,,,,,,,

An approximately 60-fold methotrexate (MTX)-resistant subline was developed in oxidized folate (pteroylglutamic acid: PGA) (CCRF-CEM/MTX60-PGA) from human T-cell leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM; this line exhibited impaired membrane transport of the drug. Further enhancement of MTX resistance resulted in selection of an approximately 5000-fold MTX-resistant subline (CCRF-CEM/ MTX5000-PGA), which showed increased dihydrofolate reductase activity due to gene amplification in addition to further impairment of MTX transport. An approximately 140-fold MTX-resistant subline, and then a 1500-fold MTX-resistant subline were developed in reduced folate (10 nM leucovorin) (CCRF-CEM/MTX140-LV and CCRF-CEM/MTX1500-LV); they exhibited increased dihydrofolate reductase due to gene amplification accompanied by increased intracellular drug accumulation of MTX. While CCRF-CEM/MTX140-LV and CCRF-CEM/MTX1500-LV cells showed cross-resistance to TMQ, CCRF-CEM/MTX60-PGA and CCRF-CEM/MTX5000-PGA cells were at least as sensitive to TMQ as the parent cells. TMQ was more potent against approximately 200-fold N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic-acid (CB3717)-resistant human T-cell leukemia MOLT-3 sublines developed in PGA (MOLT-3/CB3717(200)-PGA) or leucovorin (MOLT-3/CB3717(200)-LV), as compared to the parent cells; MOLT-3/CB3717(200)-PGA and MOLT-3/CB3717(200)-LV cells were resistant to CB3717 by virtue of impaired transport, only the former possessing gene amplification of thymidylate synthase. The cytotoxicity of TMQ in both MOLT-3/CB3717(200)-PGA and MOLT-3/CB3717(200)-LV cells was reduced by addition of leucovorin in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting intracellular folate deficiency as a cause of TMQ sensitivity. These results demonstrate that TMQ overcomes transport-impaired antifolate resistance, irrespective of gene amplification of dihydrofolate reductase or thymidylate synthase. Types of folate used during the development of antifolate resistance seem to be important in relation to the mechanism of TMQ responsiveness as well as that of antifolate resistance.","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara.']",,,,,PMC5921512,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, they are readily and unambiguously distinguished after agarose gel electrophoresis and assigned to a specific V-D-J gene rearrangement. There is no need for labor-intensive and time-consuming Southern blot hybridization or nested PCR. To evaluate the multiplex assay we chose 45 DNA samples of childhood ALL analyzed beforehand for TCR-delta gene rearrangements by Southern blot and single PCR of which 30 showed TCR-delta gene rearrangements.

In contrast to the West, where chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is the most common disorder, in Hong Kong there is a clear predominance of B cell lymphomas in leukaemic phase accounting for two-thirds of the cases and particularly those displaying lymphoplasmacytic features or with villous lymphocytes. CLL in Hong Kong has similar clinical and laboratory features to the disease in patients from the West. Distinct disease categories, rare in the West such as the variant form of hairy cell leukaemia and T cell prolymphocytic leukaemia, are also documented. It is unclear whether the differences in prevalence of disease subtypes between Hong Kong and the West relate to different genetic background or environmental factors determinant of the development or progression of the leukaemia.

We therefore examined the kinetics of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), p16INK4A, and pRB activation during IL-6-mediated patient MM cell growth compared with growth of IL-6 unresponsive patient plasma cell leukemia (PCL) cells. CDK4 protein was more strongly expressed in PCL cells than in MM cells. On the other hand, p16 protein was present in MM cells but undetectable in PCL cells. Interestingly, IL-6 induced peak proliferation of MM cells at days 1-3, with a return to baseline levels of DNA synthesis by days 6-9 in spite of replenishing IL-6. In these cells, IL-6 triggered a sustained increase in CDK4 by day 1 and a gradual increase in p16 to day 9. The progressive increase in p16 without further increments in CDK4 resulted in a shift from cyclin D2-CDK4/CDK6 binding at days 1-3 to p16-CDK4/CDK6 complex formation at days 6-9. Both phosphorylated pRB and dephosphorylated pRB were present initially in patient MM cells; IL-6 triggered a shift to phosphorylated pRB and G1 to S transition at days 1-3, with return to baseline levels of dephosphorylated pRB and related G1 growth arrest by day 9. No similar changes in CDK4, p16, or cell cycle profile were observed in IL-6 nonresponsive PCL cells.

The NB4/RA cells were neither differentiated by a single or a combination of RA isoforms, nor by the addition of clotrimazole (P450-inhibitor) or interferon gamma. However, the combination of RA and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio) adenosine cyclic 3',5'-monophosphate (a cAMP analog, 8-CPT-cAMP) induced differentiation. Immunostaining of NB4/RA cells using anti-PML antibody showed a microgranular pattern which was not restored even by the combination of RA and 8-CPT-cAMP, whereas the microgranular pattern in NB4 cells was rapidly restored to the normal speckled pattern by RA. Western blot analysis revealed that RA alone or the combination with 8-CPT-cAMP did not down-regulate PML-RARalpha in NB4/RA cells, which was in contrast to NB4 cells. The PML-RARalpha fusion gene and transcript in NB4/RA cells were conserved as well as the RARalpha gene and transcripts. Sequence analysis of the PML-RARalpha transcript in NB4/RA cells indicated a Pro (CCG) to Leu (CTG) mutation at codon 900 (type L) in AF-2 domain, while the RARalpha transcript had a normal sequence. These data suggest that differentiation of APL by RA is triggered directly through PML-RARalpha, and is associated with its degradation. Furthermore, there might be another mechanism of differentiation which does not require the down-regulation of PML-RARalpha and the restoration of the PML-staining pattern.","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University Hospital, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All cases showed monoclonal CD5/CD19-positive lymphocytosis, with more than 10% large lymphocytes and/or prolymphocytes in peripheral blood smears and reactivity with FMC7, or bright expression of surface immunoglobulins in a fraction of the cases. Karyotype aberrations were detected in 27 of 43 cases (62.8%). Recurrent chromosome changes were +12 (nine cases), 13q14 aberrations (five cases), 11q anomalies (three cases), 6q21-q23 abnormalities and 4q anomalies with different breakpoints (two cases each). Additional chromosome changes were seen in four cases with +12, in three cases with 13q14 anomalies, in two cases with 11q anomalies, in one case with 6q and 4q anomalies. Trisomy 12 was associated with 13q14 anomalies in three cases, one of which also had an 11q abnormality; other associations, found in one case each, were: 13q14 deletion with a 6q anomaly, 11q anomaly with 13q- and 7q-, a 6q anomaly with 7q- and +12. Interphase cytogenetics confirmed the results of chromosome banding analysis and showed that six patients with normal karyotype or no mitosis in fact had concomitant +12 and 13q14 deletion in four cases and isolated +12 or 13q14 deletion in one case each, with a resultant 76% overall incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities. The presence of +12, 13q14 deletions, 11q, and 6q21-q23 anomalies in 19 cases was associated with a 2-month median interval between diagnosis and start of treatment, as compared with a 24-month median interval in 14 cases with normal karyotype or non-recurrent chromosome changes (P = 0.003). We conclude that aCLL is characterized by a relatively high incidence of chromosome anomalies, with recurrent chromosome changes, involving chromosomes 12, 13q14, 6q21q23, 11q, and, possibly, 4q. The presence of complex karyotypes, with concomitant abnormalities of 13q, +12, 6q, 11q, suggests that the development of sequential chromosome changes, rather than any single specific anomaly, may underlie leukemogenesis in this cytologic subset of CLL, partially accounting for the relatively aggressive clinical course.","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Terapie Avanzate, Universita di Ferrara, Italy.']",,['CA 39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic B cells with very poor responses have defective rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous substrates, especially phospholipase C (PLC)gamma, as well as a defective calcium elevation on BCR stimulation. This points to a defect in BCR-associated protein tyrosine kinase (PTK). We investigated whether a defect in Syk, a PTK that is pivotal in coupling BCR to downstream signaling events, could account for these alterations. Syk tyrosine phosphorylation triggered by BCR ligation was severely impaired in B-CLL cells with low calcium responses to anti-mu stimulation. Syk associations were also defective, as concomitant tyrosine phosphorylation of a Syk-associated 145 kDa protein comigrating with PLCgamma-2 was only detected in responding B-CLL cells. By contrast, we found similar expression of the kinase regardless of B-CLL cell responsiveness. These results are consistent with the possibility that very proximal BCR signaling elements in some B-CLL cells are unable to connect with downstream biochemical events dominated by tyrosine phosphorylation and the potential docking function of Syk PTK.","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire, CNRS URA 625, Centre Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of these abnormalities did not correlate with any specific histological subtype: three cases were small lymphocytic lymphomas (two of them reclassified as mantle cell lymphoma on the basis of the REAL classification), two diffuse large cell lymphomas and two small non-cleaved cell lymphomas (one of them considered to be a Burkitt-like lymphoma according to the REAL). These seven cases showed a trend towards worse prognostic indicators than the remaining patients, and this was confirmed in the survival analysis, since the presence of p16 gene abnormalities was associated with a shorter survival (10 vs 81 months, P = 0.0006). In the multivariate analysis, p16 abnormalities were selected as an independent prognostic factor together with the LDH and beta2-microglobulin. These findings support a role for the p16 gene in the pathogenesis of B cell NHLs and suggest an association of p16 abnormalities with aggressive forms of the disease that could be useful to predict the prognosis of patients.","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Paseo de San Vicente, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The techniques used were double immunostaining with CD5 and CD19 and quantitative estimation of the number of both antigens with standard microbeads. Reference values were established on normal peripheral blood and bone marrow controls. Patients were considered in 'immunological' remission when the percentage of CD5+ CD19+/total CD19+ cells was <25% in PB and <15% in BM. In six of the eight patients in CR, CLL cells were still detectable by flow cytometry. Only two patients, that underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplant, achieved immunological remission. CLL samples showed significantly higher CD5 and lower CD19 antigen density than normal controls (P < 0.001). Persistence of residual disease was a predictor of time to progression. None of the two patients in immunological remission relapsed within a period of 13 and 33 months, whilst two of the six patients in CR with positive flow cytometry relapsed 3 and 6 months after achieving CR. This study demonstrates that flow cytometry contributes to increase the sensitivity of the clinicohematological criteria to detect residual malignant cells in CLL patients and may be useful to monitor disease status following treatment.","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, The Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large differences in migration of monocytes towards the leukemic cell supernatants were shown (variation of approximately 10 to 150% compared to positive control), but high amounts of monocyte migration was always restricted to myeloid leukemic cells (cell lines or patient blasts). MCP-1 turned out to play a major role in the migration, firstly since there was a direct correlation between the amount of migration and the concentration of MCP-1 in the supernatants, and secondly since the addition of anti-hMCP-1 was able to inhibit migration to background level in all cases. Cytotoxicity experiments with a MTT test using MCP-1-stimulated monocytes against two human myeloid leukemic cell lines showed no increase in cell death compared to unstimulated monocytes. It is concluded that monocyte migration towards leukemic cells is restricted to the myeloid lineage and is regulated by MCP-1, which is produced in different amounts by the leukemic cells. Besides, MCP-1 does not increase the direct toxic effects of monocytes on leukemic cells.","['Department of Hematology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patterns of surface antigen expression were used to compare the morphology of distinct lymphoid cell populations present in biopsy specimens and determine the presence or absence of UCP-L. UCP-L were identified by their larger size as compared to admixed reactive lymphocytes, and the method is based on the concept that neoplastic lymphoma cells are larger than reactive lymphocytes. The comparison of relative cell sizes was determined by overlaying forward scatter histograms by multicolor gating using PAINT-A-GATE software. In order for separate gates to be set on UCP-L and reactive cell populations, UCP-L had to fulfill one or more immunophenotypic criteria. These included: (1) belonging to a subset of B cell antigen-positive cells showing restricted expression of kappa or lambda light chains; (2) belonging to a subset of CD4-positive cells having dim or absent expression of CD45RA; (3) showing alterations in antigen expression (loss, dimmer or brighter); or (4) expressing an immunophenotype that is present on only rare cell populations or is absent from reactive lymph nodes. The immunophenotypic profiles of the respective cell populations were demonstrated by cubic representations to assess more easily the co-expression of three antigens. The common morphology of UCP-L as defined by forward and side scatter grams was consistent with a 'lymphoid appearance' except in several cases of HTLV-I-positive T cell lymphoma and gammadelta T cell lymphoma. The immunophenotypic profiles of UCP-L were confirmed to correspond to the presumptive lymphoma cell population by use of a live gating procedure on the large cells, which eliminated interference by reactive cells or necrotic tissue fragments. Using this method, we identified UCP-L in 208 of 293 (71%) consecutive cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, while no UCP-L were seen in 72 cases of non-specific hyperplasia of lymph nodes. Twenty-seven cases could not properly be examined about the existence of UCP-L because of massive necrosis, extensive fibrosis or strong non-specific staining reactions of unknown cause. When those cases were eliminated from the analysis, 80% of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were found to contain UCP-L. In B cell lymphoma, the incidence of UCP-L in nodal lymphomas (80%) was much higher than in extranodal lymphomas (47%). Only one of 21 cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma was found to have UCP-L. The 3-FCM procedure was validated by the combined use of immunohistochemistry, morphologic examination, cytogenetic and antigen receptor gene rearrangement analysis by Southern blot hybridization. Our findings indicate that detection of UCP-L by 3-FCM is a reliable method to distinguish non-Hodgkin lymphomas from reactive hyperplasias in the majority of cases, even when the reactive cell population predominates over the malignant cell population.","['Department of Oral Pathology, Tohoku University School of Dentistry, Sendai, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blast cells were first identified by CD45/SSC gating in 74 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the results were compared to a conventional FSC/SSC gating procedure and to MGG-staining smears. The percentages of blast cells in these samples as defined by the morphological analysis of MGG smears correlated better with the values determined by CD45/SSC gating (r = 0.94) than with the blast cell counts recorded with FSC/SSC gating (r = 0.76). These findings were not surprising because while CD45 expression was regularly lower on leukemic blasts than on normal lymphoid and monocytic cells, the FCS/SSC characteristics of these populations were overlapping. In 53 samples, the blast cell populations were also analyzed with a panel of FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibodies that were utilized in double labeling with CD45-PE. We show that the CD45/SSC gating procedure improved phenotypic determination of the blast cells in three ways: (1) by discriminating between leukemic blast cells and residual normal cells; (2) by excluding normal cells from the phenotypic analysis of leukemic blast cells; and (3) by identifying blast cell heterogeneity in many cases of leukemia on the basis of different CD45 display. Moreover, this immunophenotyping procedure on whole bone marrow samples also allowed an efficient discrimination between the various cell lineages and facilitated the analysis of leukemic blasts present in low proportions.","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital du Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FasL mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 38 out of 63 lymphoma biopsy specimens representative of various subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's disease. FasL was co-expressed with Fas mRNA in most cases. Flow cytometry (FACS) analysis showed a bright FasL staining in 31% to up to 75% of the total cell population from 14 out of 16 samples; the presence of the FasL protein was confirmed by Western blotting. Dual-color FACS analysis showed that FasL was expressed by T cells in B-NHLs and T-NHLs. A significant percentage of B cells in various B-NHLs also stained positively for FasL. Freshly separated neoplastic B cells from three FasL+ and one FasL- B-NHLs displayed a relative resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis, when compared to reactive T cells isolated from the same tissue samples. In contrast, the sensitivity to Fas-mediated killing of the T cells isolated from two FasL+ T-NHLs was not uniform. These data show that (1) FasL is expressed in both neoplastic and reactive cells from a significant proportion of lymphoma cases, and (2) that the intratumoral FasL+/Fas+ reactive T cells are more sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis than the neoplastic FasL+/Fas+ malignant B cells. A putative defect in the Fas/FasL pathway may thus favor the development of malignant B cell populations.","['Department of Pathology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, INSERM U 119, Marseille, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that high expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit in AML is associated with poor prognosis. To determine whether the MDR phenotype is associated with high c-Kit expression, the monoclonal antibodies UIC-2 and YB5.B8, which identify Pgp and c-Kit, respectively, were used for indirect immunofluorescence labelling of 50 de novo AML specimens. Quantitative dye efflux studies using Rhodamine123 were also carried out to assess the functional drug efflux capability of these samples. Pgp expression by the majority of primary AML was comparable to that seen in subsets of cells from normal bone marrow and Spearman rank analysis showed no relationship with c-Kit expression (rs = 0.20, P = 0.16). However, c-Kit expression did show a significant correlation with Rhodamine123 efflux (rs = 0.57, P = 0.0001), suggesting that the MDR phenotype, Pgp mediated or other, may contribute to the prognostic significance of high c-Kit expression. The monoclonal antibody UIC-2 was used specifically to block Pgp activity of a limited number of leukaemic specimens and cell lines, and evidence of non-Pgp-mediated efflux was found. The existence of alternative mechanisms may explain the relatively low correlation of Pgp expression with dye efflux within the leukaemic samples (rs = 0.47, P = 0.0006) and has implications for prognosis in AML. The c-Kit ligand, stem cell factor, did not influence drug efflux activity of the nine c-Kit-positive AML specimens tested. Thus the correlation between c-Kit and the MDR phenotype in AML is likely to be a consequence of co-expression at a similar stage of differentiation, and may account for the previously observed association of high c-Kit expression with poor outcome.","['Leukaemia Research Unit, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forced expression of wild-type, but not mutant, p53 resulted in growth arrest, accumulation of p21 and Bax proteins, and delayed cell death. Wild-type p53 enhanced the cytotoxic effects of some drugs and attenuated those of others. Compared with wild-type p53, mutant p53 induced much stronger sensitization to drug cytotoxicity. This occurred in the absence of effects on cell cycle progression or activation of several p53 target genes.

We previously identified activation of the CD95 (APO-1/Fas) receptor/CD95 ligand (CD95/CD95-L) system as a key mechanism for drug-induced apoptosis. Here, we show that therapeutic concentrations of doxorubicin, methotrexate and cytarabine also induce apoptosis via activation of the CD95 system in primary leukemia cells in vivo. CD95-resistant and doxorubicin-resistant leukemia and neuroblastoma cells display cross-resistance for induction of cell death. Down-regulation of CD95 expression was found in drug-resistant and CD95-resistant cell lines. Furthermore, up-regulation of CD95-L, previously shown to mediate drug-induced apoptosis in a variety of tumor cells, was completely blocked in doxorubicin-resistant cells. The prototype caspase (ICE/Ced-3 protease) substrate, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), was cleaved in sensitive, but not in resistant tumor cells following CD95 triggering or drug treatment. Since failure to activate CD95-L was not due to decreased drug uptake or increased drug efflux, non-multi-drug resistance (non-MDR) mechanisms are involved in this type of resistance. These findings suggested that an intact CD95 system plays a key role in determining sensitivity or resistance towards anticancer therapy.","[""Hematology/Oncology, University Children's Hospital, and Division of Molecular Oncology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to elucidate the mechanisms of megakaryocytosis, ELISA assays of blood levels of thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-11 (IL-11) were done in 45 patients with AMM and compared with normal volunteer controls. Higher blood TPO levels were found in AMM than in controls (P < 0.0001), and blood TPO levels were correlated with the degree of marrow fibrosis (P = 0.0078). Blood levels of IL-6 were also significantly higher in AMM, when compared with controls (P < 0.0001). However, no correlation was found between blood IL-6 levels and degree of marrow fibrosis. No correlation was found between either TPO or IL-6 and the number of blood platelet counts, the number of marrow megakaryocytes, WBC counts, or the degree of splenomegaly. Blood IL-11 levels were undetectable in most patients and no significant difference was found in AMM as compared to controls. The present study demonstrated that, while in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or aplastic anemia, blood TPO levels are relatively correlated with the numbers of platelet and/or megakaryocyte mass, blood TPO levels do not correlate with blood platelet counts, or marrow megakaryocyte mass in AMM. Therefore, in AMM, other mechanisms such as the number of TPO receptors on platelets or megakaryocytes, c-MPL receptor abnormalities, abnormal production of TPO mRNA and so on, will have to be studied. Furthermore, TPO may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of marrow fibrosis; IL-6 may be a factor in the development of marrow megakaryocytosis but its elevated blood levels may represent a secondary immune phenomenon; and IL-11 probably does not play a significant role in causing marrow megakaryocytosis in this disease.","['Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York 11212, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 151 patients in home care, 70 (46%) developed a total of 109 febrile episodes, performance status and neutrophil count significantly affecting the incidence of infections. Fever was of unknown origin in 51% of cases and microbiologically and clinically documented infections accounted for 26 and 23% of the cases, respectively. Oral ciprofloxacin in patients not neutropenic and intravenous ceftriaxone plus amikacin in neutropenic patients was shown to be effective and suitable for empiric home antibacterial treatment; in fact, 65% of febrile episodes responded to the initial antibacterial therapy with a further 16% after modification. Overall, 19.3% of the infective episodes were fatal, the prognosis appearing to be similar to that usually observed in the same category of patients in an inpatient setting. Our experience appears to show that a home care program could be the option of choice for patients with advanced cancer even in the setting of infective complications. It could improve the quality of life of patients and of their families, and it could save these subjects the risk of developing infections by resistant nosocomial isolates.","['Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth factors and steroids secreted by the conceptus and uterus, as well as ligand receptors produced by the conceptus, are thought to regulate trophoblastic elongation. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to characterize conceptus gene expression for the steroidogenic enzymes 17alpha-hydroxylase and aromatase and the mesodermal marker brachyury, as well as the expression of receptors for fibronectin (integrin beta-1), progesterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prostaglandin F2alpha, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), prior to and during trophoblastic elongation. Total RNA was extracted from individual conceptuses from Day 10 to Day 12 of pregnancy. Gene expression was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on conceptuses having 2- to 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, and 10- to 12-mm spherical, 13- to 25-mm tubular, and > 100-mm filamentous morphologies. There was a stage of development effect on both 17alpha-hydroxylase (p < 0.001) and aromatase (p < 0.003) gene expression. Initial 17alpha-hydroxylase gene expression was detected in early spherical conceptuses (2-4 mm), increasing abruptly through to 7-mm conceptuses. Aromatase gene expression increased dramatically in 6- to 7-mm conceptuses, with increased expression throughout development. Gene expression for LIF receptor (LIFR) (p < 0.02) was similar to that for 17alpha-hydroxylase, while brachyury gene expression began in 6-mm conceptuses and increased (p < 0.001) throughout development. Integrin beta-1 was expressed at all stages of development. Conceptus gene expression was not detected for progesterone, estrogen, oxytocin, and prostaglandin F2alpha receptors. Prior to elongation, dynamic changes in gene expression are occurring that appear to be associated with estrogen production and preparation of the conceptuses for elongation. LIFR expression is highly associated with steroidogenic enzyme production with an initial peak preceding rapid trophoblastic elongation, suggesting that LIF may be involved in early conceptus development in the pig.","['Department of Animal Science, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater 74078, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPO has potent stimulatory effects on platelet production in patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. In addition to sustaining megakaryocytopoiesis, TPO may play an important role in regulating neutrophil activation and erythropoiesis. Furthermore, TPO induces proliferation of acute myeloblastic leukemia cells in vitro in some cases. These results suggest that TPO may be multifunctional factor. Recently osteosclerosis is observed in TPO transgenic mice. To determine whether TPO can modulate the osteoclastic differentiation from hematopoietic stem cells, we investigated the effect of TPO on in vitro osteogenesis. TPO inhibited the formation of osteoclastic cells and decreased the areas of bone resorption pits in a dose-dependent manner. We examined whether transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), major cytokines produced by megakaryocytes, mediate the inhibitory effect of TPO. The addition of either anti-TGF-beta or anti-PDGF antibody to bone marrow cell cultures completely antagonized the effect of TPO on osteoclastogenesis. These data suggest that TPO inhibits osteoclastogenesis by stimulating thrombopoiesis and that TGF-beta and PDGF mediate the effect of TPO by impacting macrophage-lineage cells as osteoclast precursors.","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Osaka City University Medical School.']",,,26,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis and cytotoxicity were correlated at low and intermediate concentrations, whereas at long intervals and high concentrations of ML I mostly necrotic effects were observed. The data showed that in the concentration range of low cytotoxicity ML I-induced cell death is quantitatively due to apoptotic processes. The immunomodulatory activity of ML I was investigated in vitro by measuring cytokine release. At concentrations of low cytotoxicity ML I showed immunostimulatory activity on PBMC and THP-1. RT-PCR with THP-1 cells confirmed that cytokine induction by ML I is regulated on the transcriptional level.

Engagement of MHC class II molecules with antibodies results in detachment of B cells previously bound to interferon-gamma-activated human umbilical cord venous endothelial cells. This process depends on metabolic energy, active signaling and protein tyrosine kinase activity. The adhesion pathway influenced by this signaling event is neuraminidase sensitive. The anti-adhesive signaling program is activated in B cell lines with a mature phenotype, e.g. normal B cells from spleen and tonsil. In contrast, cell lines with a pre-B cell phenotype and normal B cells from peripheral blood are refractory to MHC class II-mediated regulation of adhesion.

Fyn has been shown to associate with the TCR-CD3 complex, the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 and several co-receptors such as CD28 which are crucial for initiating T cell activation and proliferation. The molecular basis of how Fyn is associated with these transmembrane proteins is largely unknown. To investigate the Fyn association with the TCR-CD3 complex, CD45 and CD28 at the molecular level, various Fyn/beta-galactosidase fusion proteins were constructed and expressed in Jurkat cells. Co-localization experiments applying antibody-induced co-capping and double immunofluorescence staining techniques were used to study the association of these fusion proteins with the TCR-CD3 complex, CD45 and CD28. Our results revealed that co-localization of Fyn with the TCR-CD3 complex requires the unique N terminus whereas co-localization with CD45 depends on the unique N terminus, the Src homology (SH)3- and a functional SH2 domain. CD28 co-localizes with Fyn molecules that contain the N terminus and a functional SH2 domain. These results suggest that Fyn association with the TCR-CD3 complex, CD45 and CD28 is mediated by different molecular mechanisms.","['Roche Research Center, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The downstream effector targets of the CD28-activated PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling pathway remain poorly defined, but recent evidence from other systems has shown that Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) is a major target of PI 3-kinase and have indicated that a major function of PKB is the regulation of cell survival events. Given the strong coupling of CD28 to PI 3-kinase and the known protective effects of both CD28 and PI 3-kinase against apoptosis in different cell models, we investigated the effects of CD28 on PKB activation. We demonstrate that ligation of CD28 by either anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies or the natural ligand B7.1, results in the marked activation of PKB in both the leukemic T cell line Jurkat and freshly isolated human peripheral blood-derived normal T lymphocytes. Our data suggest therefore, that PKB may be an important intracellular signal involved in CD28 signal transduction and demonstrate CD28 coupling to downstream elements of a signaling cascade known to promote cell survival.","['Department of Pharmacology, Bath University Claverton Down, GB.']",,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognostic relevance of these dysplastic features for patients with de novo AML remains unclear. In order to evaluate the role of dysplasia in de novo AML, bone marrow aspirates from 69 patients were analyzed prospectively and investigated separately for erythropoiesis, granulopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis by three independent investigators. The overall complete remission (CR) rate was 48.8% and partial remission (PR) or nonresponders constituted 52.2% of the patients investigated. The median overall survival time was 5 months with a disease-free interval of 3.5 months for all patients. Dysgranulopoiesis (DysG) was observed in 30.4%, dysmegakaryopoiesis (DysM) in 50.7%, and dyserythropoiesis (DysE) in 43.5%. Of all patients, 26.0% showed trilineage dysplastic features and were thus classified as AML/TLMD. A significantly worse prognosis (Kaplan-Meyer plot, Student's t-test) was calculated for those patients with detection of only DysG (p = 0.002), DysM (p = 0.02), DysE (p = 0.04) as compared with patients without any dysplastic signs. An unfavorable karyotype was correlated with patients showing DysG (P = 0.02) and DysM (P = 0.04). For these patients with an unfavorable karyotype, the occurrence of any dysplastic features had no additional prognostic impact. Dysplastic features (DysG, DysM, DysE) seem to be an important prognostic factor in de novo AML correlating with short overall survival. DysG and DysM correlated well with the appearance of unfavorable chromosomal abnormalities. It may be reasonable to assume that patients with dysplastic features should be considered for more aggressive treatment schedules at the time of diagnosis.","['Department of Medicine, Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, RET was shown to be differentially expressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a disease characterized by excessive cell growth and aberrant maturation of cells, with the highest levels of expression in leukemias with monocytic differentiation. RET is known to be expressed in cells from the excretory system and from the developing central and peripheral nervous system. Both activating and inactivating aberrations in the RET gene have been detected in disorders derived from these tissues. To investigate whether the differential expression is a primary defect in AML, the presence of RET alterations was scanned by Southern blot analysis on DNA of blasts obtained from 17 AML patients. However, no RET gene aberrations were found. Subsequently, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis was performed on the DNA of blasts from ten selected cases. All five variants detected turned out to represent neutral DNA polymorphisms, including a novel polymorphism in exon 14.

Moreover, in most studies qualitative information on the presence/absence of MDR-1 expression has been used instead of quantitative results. In addition, results usually refer to the total BM population and not specifically to blast cells. In the present study we analyzed the expression of MDR-1 in a series of 50 newly diagnosed de novo AML using a double-staining technique: (a) monoclonal antibodies for the specific identification of blast cells and (b) the rhodamine-123 efflux assay, which allows a quantitative and calibrated measurement of MDR-1 function. Expression of MDR-1 was correlated with clinical, biological, and immunophenotypical disease characteristics. All patients were uniformly treated according to the AML 87/91 protocols of the Spanish Pethema Cooperative Group; the median age was 51 +/- 19 years and the FAB distribution was as follows: 2 M0, 9 M1, 9 M2, 12 M3, 11 M4, 5 M5, and 2 M6 cases. Upon grouping the 50 AML patients analyzed according to the level of rh123 elimination, it was observed that those cases with > or = 30% decrease in rh123 fluorescence displayed higher WBC counts (9 +/- 12 vs 37 +/- 73 x 10(9)/l, p = 0.02) and platelet numbers (94 +/- 11 vs 35 +/- 25 x 10(9)/l, p = 0.02), together with a higher incidence of extramedullary involvement (35% vs 24%, p = 0.02). Half of the patients (47%) displaying a low rh123 elimination (< 30%) showed M3 morphology, while among the 33 patients with a higher rate of rh123 elimination (> or = 30%), only four (12%) corresponded to the M3 morphological subtype (p = 0.0006). From the immunophenotypic point of view, a low rate of rh123 elimination was associated with a lower expression of HLADR antigen (p = 0.003) and a higher expression of CD117 (p = 0.01). Regarding the possible prognostic influence of MDR1 expression, we found that a high rate of rh123 elimination (> 30%) was associated with a tendency towards poor disease outcome, illustrated by both a lower complete remission rate with the first cycle of chemotherapy (36% vs 56%) and a lower median disease-free survival (22 months vs median DFS not reached), although differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1 in both comparisons). This data shows that although MDR-1 can be a relevant parameter in the evaluation of AML patients, larger series of patients using appropriate techniques for specifically analyzing the MDR of blast cells will be necessary in order to establish the final clinical value of this parameter.","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The availability of suitable donors has more than doubled due to large registries of persons volunteering for marrow donation. With improved techniques for histocompatibility typing, it has become possible to study the role of specific histoincompatibilities for graft-versus-host disease and graft-versus-leukemia reactions. The source of hematopoietic stem cells now comprises not only bone marrow, but also stem cells mobilized into the peripheral blood and stem cells from cord blood. Hematopoietic growth factors have found a large distribution in the mobilization of stem cells and support for hematological reconstitution. They are studied for the expansion of pools of stem cells. Reconstitution of antileukemia and antiviral activity has been achieved by adoptive immunotherapy using lymphocytes and dendritic cells cultured in vitro. The way from transplantation of bone marrow to cellular and genetic engineering leads to new indications such as treatment of severe autoimmune disease.

Retroviral vectors developed from murine leukemia viruses reproducibly transfer genes into murine stem cells, but are inefficient at gene insertion into stem cells of larger animals or man. A growing knowledge of stem cell biology suggests that this inefficiency reflects the quiescent state of stem cells, even when incubated in the presence of multiple cytokines and low expression of the receptor for amphotropic retroviral vectors. Alternative vector systems are being explored in an effort to overcome these barriers to stem cell-targeted gene transfer. Our work has shown that recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors, which have the potential for transducing quiescent cells, transfer, express and integrate a globin gene linked to its normal regulatory elements in human erythroid cells, but only at very high multiplicities of infection. The integrated genome was stable and the encoded globin gene was expressed at levels equivalent to a normal globin gene.","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",,"['P01 HL 53749/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",85,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the frequency of these specific G-CSF receptor mutations in patients with neutropenic disorders undergoing treatment with recombinant human (r-metHu)G-CSF (Filgrastim). Nucleotides 2306 to 2561, including the critical region (nucleotides 2384-2429) from the intracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor gene, were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and DNA was sequenced directly and after transformation in E. coli. Four of 30 patients with severe congenital neutropenia displayed a point mutation in the tested cytoplasmic region of the G-CSF receptor gene. Two of the four patients with a mutated G-CSF receptor developed acute myeloid leukemia secondary to congenital neutropenia. G-CSF receptor analyses were performed in myeloid cells taken at different time points in the four patients with the mutated receptor, and no correlation between occurrence of the mutation and time or dose of r-metHuG-CSF treatment was found. No point mutations in the G-CSF receptor critical domain could be detected in cells from the other 26 congenital neutropenia patients. Additionally, no G-CSF receptor point mutations could be seen in neutrophils, blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia, and bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients suffering from severe aplastic anemia. Similar results were obtained by Touw et al., demonstrating that five out of 25 patients with congenital neutropenia reveal G-CSF receptor mutations. These data show that the point mutations in the critical region of the intracellular part of the G-CSF receptor occur only in a subgroup of severe congenital neutropenia patients. Furthermore, our data suggest that the described G-CSF receptor point mutations are not correlated with the start, duration or doses of r-metHuG-CSF treatment, but might result from genetic instability in the G-CSF receptor gene in severe congenital neutropenia.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of ablative preparative regimens were used, and blood progenitor cells were mobilized by treatment with Cytoxan and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Therapy-related deaths resulted from graft-versus-host disease, septic shock, veno-occlusive disease bleeding and intestinal pulmonary fibrosis. Because the transplantation procedures were carried out on people who continued to be exposed to low-level irradiation, the post-transplantation period included a conservative strategy for prevention of graft-versus-host disease.

A majority of the studies completed to date have been of the descriptive type, which only correlate average population exposure with average rate of cancer incidence as a function of calendar period. Since individual dosimetry is not performed in descriptive studies, it is unclear whether exposure precedes the development of cancer and a final decision cannot be made regarding the association between radiation exposure and cancer. This paper reviews the background epidemiology and outlines an analytical study design that is needed to clarify the unclear association between Chernobyl fallout exposure and childhood cancer. We discuss the essential elements of an analytical case-control design such as genetic predisposition, vital statistics, sample size and power determinations, ascertainment of cases and controls, and phenomenological dose modeling to establish individual doses. Examples such as cytogenetic biodosimetry, medical radiation dosimetry, and cytogenetic characterization of leukemia to minimize exposure and diagnostic misclassification are provided. We recommend the analytical methods described in this paper for studying the role of Chernobyl radionuclides and development of childhood cancer.","['Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antileukemic activity of regenerating hematopoietic tissue can be purified to a homogeneous state. The radioprotective activity is associated with the production of regulatory molecules that have been partially characterized.

The aim of the present study was to determine if the efficacy of this procedure could be further enhanced by including CD20 and CD72 MAbs in the current protocol. Leukemia-contaminated remission bone marrow was simulated by mixing cell line cells and normal bone marrow cells. The efficacy of purging of malignant cells was determined by culturing the cells in a limiting dilution assay. The effect of including CD20 and CD72 in the immunorosette depletion was limited. In contrast, when these MAbs were added during complement-mediated cell lysis, a significant increase in depletion of tumor cells was observed. This was true when complement lysis was carried out alone (0.4 versus 3.0 log depletion for Ros cells) and when it was preceded by immunorosette depletion (2.7 versus 4.1 log depletion for Ros cells).

We demonstrated physical interaction between HSF2 and p62 both by a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay in vitro and by a two-hybrid assay in K562 cells. HSF1 is also able to interact with p62 on a GST pull-down assay, but not on a mammalian two-hybrid system.

In difluoromethylornithine-resistant L1210 cells stimulated to growth from quiescence, treatment with LY294002 inhibited cell growth and provoked a complete block of the induction of ODC activity (IC50 approximately 2 microM) and ODC protein. Some reduction in the accumulation of ODC mRNA was also observed, whereas ODC turnover was not affected significantly. Wortmannin, another specific inhibitor of PI3K, structurally unrelated to LY294002, also inhibited ODC induction with an IC50 of about 10 nM. These results indicate that PI3K activity is required for the induction of ODC, possibly affecting both ODC mRNA level and translation. Since p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) is considered an important mediator of PI3K action in several experimental systems, the effect of rapamycin, which can lead to selective inhibition of p70S6K, was also investigated. Rapamycin inhibited p70S6K activity and produced ODC inhibiting effects similar to those elicited by LY294002. However, LY294002 and wortmannin at concentrations which inhibited almost completely PI3K activity did not decrease p70S6K activity, suggesting that p70S6K does not mediate the PI3K effects on ODC, but may lie on a separate pathway in this experimental model.","['Dipartimento di Biochimica G.

Abnormalities in this process may result in the expansion of malignant B cell precursors in B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). ALL cells share surface antigens with normal early precursor B cells. We have studied here the role of Fas/APO-1 (CD95) antigen on leukaemic precursor B cell line growth and survival, and the modulation of its effects by signals involved in normal early B cell development. Four ALL cell lines representative of the early steps of B cell differentiation are shown to express surface Fas/APO-1 (CD95) antigen and to undergo apoptosis in the presence of anti-Fas cross-linking antibodies. This effect is strongly enhanced when pre-B, but not pro-B cells, are pretreated with IL-7 but not with IL-2, IL-3, IL-4 or IL-10. Furthermore, pre-B cell death induced by anti-Fas antibodies in combination with IL-7 is increased upon pre-B receptor but not CD19 cross-linking. Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression is not influenced by IL-7 or pre-BR stimulation in either pro-B or pre-B cell lines. These results indicate that signals involved in normal early B cell development can modulate the Fas (CD95)-mediated apoptosis of leukaemic precursor B cells.","[""Departement d'Immunologie, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.""]",,,,,PMC2265507,,,,,,,,,,

Using hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a model, we established an RT-PCR technique for amplification of cDNA fragments with a length of about 5 kb. The RT reaction was carried out with a Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase lacking detectable RNase H activity. For PCR reactions an enzyme mix containing Taq and Pwo DNA polymerases was used. Hot start and addition of 5% DMSO were also important to efficiently achieve long PCR products. About 10(6) HCV genome equivalents/ml in serum were needed in order to amplify the HCV genome in only two cDNA fragments covering about 98% of the complete genome. Analysis of the HCV quasi-species is also possible by this method as shown by sequencing of the hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) after cloning of cDNAs. The integrity of the long cDNA clones was proven by (1) restriction analyses, (2) partial sequencing and (3) expression of respective gene products. In vitro transcribed cDNAs were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Structural and nonstructural HCV proteins were identified by immunoprecipitation using patient serum. These results suggest that the two cDNA clones encode a complete and functional open reading frame of HCV.","['Institut fur Virologie, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These fields are predominantly of low frequency (50/60 Hz) and are generally of low intensity. Review of the epidemiological evidence shows that the association between exposure to EMFs and cancer is weak and inconsistent, and generally fails to show a dose-response relationship. Moreover, in view of the methodological problems of these epidemiological studies, animal and laboratory studies are urgently needed to determine whether EMFs could be initiators and/or promoters of cancers. The objective of the present study was to determine whether chronic exposure to 60 Hz linear (single axis) sinusoidal, continuous-wave magnetic fields (MFs) of different intensities might increase the risk of leukemia and solid tumor development in rodents born and raised under these fields. Five groups of 50 female F344 rats were exposed for 20 h/day to 60 Hz MFs at intensities of <0.02 (sham controls), 2, 20, 200, and 2000 microT. Full body exposure to the different fields was administered for 104 wk starting from the prenatal period (2 days before birth) and continuing during lactation and weaning until late adult life. Body weight, survival, and clinical observations were evaluated in all groups of animals during in-life exposure. Necropsy was performed on all exposed and control animals that died, were found moribund, or were killed at termination of the study. To preserve and demonstrate the absence of any experimental bias, all clinical observations and pathological evaluations were conducted under ""blinded"" conditions. Fifty organs and tissues were evaluated in each animal, with special attention to the incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia, brain tumors, and mammary tumors. The findings from this chronic carcinogenicity study demonstrate that, under our defined experimental conditions, exposure to 60 Hz linear (single axis) sinusoidal, continuous wave MFs did not affect animal survival, solid tumor, or mononuclear cell leukemia development in female F344 rats. No statistically significant, consistent, positive dose-related trends with the number of tumor-bearing animals per study group could be attributed to MF exposure.","['Immunology Research Center, Institut Armand-Frappier, University of Quebec, Laval, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We screened TSG101 for somatic mutations in DNA and RNA samples isolated from a variety of common human malignancies, EBV-immortalised B-cells, and normal lung parenchyma. Intragenic TSG101 deletions in RNA transcripts were frequently found in all types of samples. Analysis of DNA failed to show genomic rearrangements corresponding to transcripts containing deletions in the same samples. The breakpoints of most transcript deletions coincide with genuine or cryptic splice site sequences, suggesting that they result from alternative or aberrant splicing. A similar spectrum of transcript deletions has previously been described in the putative tumour suppressor gene FHIT. We analysed FHIT in the same series of RNA samples and detected truncated FHIT transcripts frequently in both tumour and normal tissues. In addition, transcripts from TSG101, FHIT and seven other genes were analysed in RNA isolated from normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Large TSG101 and FHIT intragenic transcript deletions were detected and these appeared to be the predominant transcript in 'aged' lymphocytes. Similar alterations were not detected in transcripts of the other genes which were analysed. Our findings demonstrate that truncated TSG101 and FHIT transcripts are commonly detected in both normal and malignant tissues and that a significant fraction of these are likely to be the result of aberrant splicing. While we cannot exclude that alterations in TSG101 and FHIT occur during cancer development, our data indicate that in this context the commonly observed transcript abnormalities are misleading.","[""CRC Human Cancer Genetics Research Group, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The leukemogenic transcription factor gene E2A-PBX1 is created through fusion of the genes E2A and PBX1 as a result of t(1;19) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We evaluated subcellular localization patterns of E2A-PBX1 protein in transfected cells using immunofluorescence. Full-length E2A-PBX1 was exclusively nuclear and was concentrated in spherical domains denoted chimeric-E2A oncoprotein domains (CODs). In contrast, nuclear fluorescence for wild-type E2A or PBX1 proteins was diffuse. Enhanced concentrations of RNA polymerase II within many CODs and the requirement for an E2A-encoded activation domain suggested transcriptional relevance. However, in situ co-detection of nascent transcripts labeled with bromouridine failed to confirm altered transcriptional activity in relation to CODs. CODs also failed to co-localize with other proteins known to occupy functional nuclear compartments, including the transcription factor PML, the spliceosome-associated protein SC-35 and the adenovirus replication factor DBP, or with foci of DNA replication. Co-transfection of Hoxb7, a homeodomain protein capable of enhancing DNA binding by PBX1, impaired COD formation, suggesting that CODs contain E2A-PBX1 protein not associated with DNA. We conclude that, as a 'gain of function' phenomenon requiring protein elements from both E2A and PBX1, COD formation may be relevant to the biology of E2A-PBX1 in leukemogenesis.","[""Department of Pathology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.""]",,['CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported that the human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) induces IL-15 in human PBMC and increases their NK activity. We describe in this work that another human herpesvirus, HHV-7, which shares genomic homology with HHV-6, also causes up-regulation of NK cell cytotoxicity via IL-15 induction. The NK cell activity of the PBMC from different donors displayed a variable range of enhancement after treatment with HHV-7. This enhancement occurred within a few hours of exposure to the virus and was blocked by Abs to IL-15, but not to other cytotoxicity-enhancing cytokines (i.e., to IFN-gamma, IL-2, TNF-alpha, or IL-12). Our results also show that this HHV-7-induced IL-15-mediated activation of NK cells occurs via IL-2R, since HHV-7-enhanced NK cytotoxic activity could be blocked completely by anti-IL-2R beta-chain mAb (anti-CD122). The up-regulation of NK cell cytotoxicity did not require infectious virus, as the use of UV-irradiated HHV-7 produced similar results. This effect was virus specific because it was abrogated by neutralizing the virus with human sera containing Abs to HHV-7. We also found increased amount of IL-15 transcripts in HHV-7-treated PBMC as compared with the untreated PBMC. Taken together, these results would suggest that host responds to HHV-7 infection by up-regulating IL-15 production, which then results in an enhancement of NK cell activity; this, in turn, may play a major role in the control of the viral infection.","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Pediatric Research Center, University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These studies suggested that signaling triggered by the FcR CD16 may be implicated in target cell-mediated anergy/apoptosis of NK cells. We hypothesized that triggering CD16 by anti-CD16 Ab should result in NK cells exhibiting functional and phenotypic properties similar to those obtained following triggering of NK cells with target cells. The findings demonstrate that the anti-CD16 mAb-treated NK cells acquired the CD16- CD56(+/dim) CD69+ Fas+ phenotype and lost their cytotoxic function, a significant number of the NK cells underwent apoptosis, and a selective induction of TNF-alpha synthesis and secretion was observed. The coaddition of IL-2 to anti-CD16 Ab-treated NK cells resulted in enhanced secretion of TNF-alpha and augmentation of the frequency of cell death. However, a minor subset of NK cells exhibited potent cytotoxic function and proliferated. The anti-CD16-induced effects in NK cells were largely abrogated by the addition of either anti-TNF-alpha Ab or TNF-binding protein in the cultures. There was an enhancement of NK cell killing following the addition of exogenous TNF-alpha into the culture. Cytochalasin B selectively triggered the secretion of TNF-alpha and significantly augmented the frequency of apoptosis of anti-CD16-treated NK cells.

In most cases of chronic myelocytic leukemia and in some cases of acute myelocytic leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia, the bcr-abl oncogene is involved in this process. Although the BCR-Abl oncoprotein demonstrates enhanced tyrosine kinase activity in leukemic cells, the mechanism by which this leads to growth factor independence remains poorly defined. One proposed mechanism is the activation of cytokine signal transduction pathways, possibly by an autocrine loop involving IL-3 and/or granulocyte-macrophage CSF. Examination of several different cell lines expressing BCR-Abl demonstrates that some of these cells have constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. We have found the constitutive activation of STAT5 in most, but not all, cell lines expressing BCR-Abl. This constitutive activation of STAT5 is variably associated with a corresponding activation of JAK kinases. Ab blocking studies show that the activation of STAT5 in these cell lines cannot be attributed to the activation of an IL-3/granulocyte-macrophage CSF-driven autocrine loop. Interestingly, samples of peripheral blood cells derived from patients with acute myelocytic leukemia and chronic myelocytic leukemia, which express BCR-Abl, demonstrate constitutive activation of STAT family members. These studies suggest that in a variety of leukemic states, BCR-Abl may use a bypass mechanism to activate cytokine signal transduction pathways.","['Department of Medicine, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York 10032, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The observed loss of NF1 allele in the myeloid malignancies of NF1 patients suggests a role of NF1 as a tumor suppressor gene. Loss of 17p was found to be quite frequent in neural crest tumors from patients with NF1, raising the possibility of p53 tumor suppressor gene involvement in other NF1-related tumors. METHODS: The authors studied mutations in the NF1 and p53 genes, using loss of heterozygosity, single strand conformation polymorphism, heteroduplex and sequencing analyses. RESULTS: An NF1 germline mutation was identified in exon 31 of a child who developed juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML). The mutation was segregated within the proband's family. A 14bp deletion at exon 6 of the p53 gene was observed when JCML was diagnosed, and the wild-type p53 allele was lost during progression of the disease. No loss of the normal NF1 allele could be detected. CONCLUSIONS: A germline mutation in the NF1 gene and sequential inactivation of p53 alleles in the malignant clone of JCML raise the possibility of a correlation between NF1 and p53 genes in the tumorigenesis of JCML.","['Cancer Molecular Genetics, Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In related B-cell neoplasms, such as multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the histologic features of bone marrow are considered to be of prognostic relevance. METHODS: To assess the prognostic features of WM, the authors reviewed the clinical and pathologic features of 22 patients. Bone marrow aspirates and core biopsies were available for each case. Immunostains for a panel of hematopoietic markers as well as p53 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were performed. RESULTS: There were 14 males and 8 females, with a mean age of 60 years. At presentation, two histologic subtypes, lymphoplasmacytoid (73%) and lymphoplasmacytic (27%), were observed. Four patterns of bone marrow infiltration were delineated: diffuse (45%), nodular-interstitial (22%), mixed paratrabecular-nodular (20%), and paratrabecular (13%). In 11 patients, the infiltrate occupied greater than 70% of the bone marrow; in 8 patients, 30-70%; and in 3 patients, less than 30%. PCNA reactivity was observed in 58% of cases and p53 reactivity in 21%. Ten patients died of disease with an average survival of 84 months. The remaining 12 patients were alive with disease at last follow-up. The pretreatment parameters that were correlated with shorter survival were hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and serum immunoglobulin M level. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that some pretreatment parameters, such as cytopenia, serum immunoglobulin M level, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy, correlate with poor prognosis for patients with WM. In contrast, histologic features and expression of p53 and PCNA did not correlate significantly with survival.","['Department of Hematologic and Lymphatic Pathology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC 20306-6000, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four patients had received both prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy, four others received prior chemotherapy only, and the remaining two patients only prior radiotherapy. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of centromere-specific probes for chromosomes 5 and 17 revealed that a dicentric rearrangement was the most common (13/16 patients examined). The genetic consequences of these chromosomal rearrangements are partial monosomy for 5q and 17p.

This translocation has also been reported in monocytic leukemia or ALL with a very early pre-B phenotype. However, whether these cytogenetically similar translocations involve the same molecular breakpoint is unknown. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a series of probes on 11q, we mapped the 11q breakpoint of the U937 cell line, which was derived from a patient with diffuse histiocytic lymphoma and was shown by FISH to have the t(10;11)(p13-14;q14-21). Subsequently, we identified a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone, y960g8, that included the breakpoint on 11q. From this YAC, we isolated a PI clone, P91B1, that was split by the 10;11 translocation. We studied four patients with a t(10;11), one of whom had acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL), one had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), one had lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL), and one had granulocytic sarcoma, by using FISH with y960g8 and P91B1. Y960g8 and P91B1 were split by the translocation in each patient. We showed that P91B1 included a recently identified gene, CALM (Clathrin Assembly Lymphoid Myeloid leukemia gene), and that AF10 was also rearranged in each patient by FISH when we used y807b3, which contains the AF10 gene. These findings indicate that hematologic malignant diseases with fusion of AF10 and CALM show various morphologic and immunologic phenotypes, suggesting that this fusion occurs in multipotential or very early precursor cells.","['Third Clinical Department, Saitama Cancer Center Hospital, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were interested to know whether mature DC can be grown in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and whether they carry the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation. Using a method recently described, DC were generated from PBMC precursors of 12 patients with CML using GM-CSF, IL-4, and monocyte-conditioned medium. DC exhibited the typical morphology with thin cytoplasmatic processes and expressed high levels of MHC class II, CD86, and CD83 typical for mature DC. After sorting with the monoclonal antibody CD83, a cell population of more than 95% CD83 positive cells was obtained. The presence of the Ph translocation was analyzed in these cells, in PBMC, lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), and in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced T blasts from the same patients by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In contrast to all other cells analyzed, the vast majority of DC (95.9 +/- 0.7%) displayed the Ph translocation, irrespective of disease stage or therapy. PBMC were predominantly positive for the Ph chromosome (67.6 +/- 7.3%), whereas only 11.4 +/- 1% of the B cells and 4.4 +/- 1.1% of the PHA blasts carried the Ph translocation. Using such leukemic DC as antigen-presenting cells, a primary CML-directed cytotoxic immune response in vitro was obtained, as shown by the specific recognition of Ph chromosome positive cells. We conclude that DC can be generated from blood progenitors of CML patients in vitro and exhibit, to a large extent, the Ph translocation. Such DC, which in a preliminary experiment have been able to induce a primary CML-directed cytotoxic immune response in vitro, might be ideal candidates for adoptive immunotherapy either by direct transfer of DC for in vivo generation of a T-cell response or by in vitro generation of CML-specific cytotoxic autologous or HLA-matched normal T-cell clones for use in vivo.","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely meningeal and cerebral involvement have been very rarely reported. We report here on three patients with multiple myeloma and meningeal or cerebral involvement (two of them with autopsy study): one case of cerebellar involvement associated with secondary plasma cell leukemia and two cases of meningeal involvement. We reviewed the characteristics of 20 cases of meningeal involvement with demonstration of plasma cells at cerebrospinal fluid analysis (18 previously reported cases and our two patients). Meningeal involvement occurs in patients with initially stage III multiple myeloma in 85% of cases and is associated with the occurrence of plasma cell leukemia in 20% of cases. The most frequent neurologic signs are: confusion (60%), altered consciousness (25%), gait disorder (25%), cranial nerve palsy (25%). Meningismus is rarely present. Diagnosis is based on cerebrospinal fluid analysis after lumbar puncture which should be made after cranial magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnosis of intra-cranial haemorrhage and infectious meningitis have to be cautiously ruled out. Despite treatments (systemic and/or intrathecal chemotherapy, radiation therapy), prognosis is very poor: mean time of survival after the occurrence of neurologic signs is about 2 months.","['Departement de medecine interne, hopital Rene-Dubos, Pontoise, France.']",,,35,,,Localisations neuromeningees du myelome multiple: trois observations et revue de la litterature.,,,,,,,,,

APL is characterized by three distinct and unique features: i) the accumulation in the bone marrow of tumor cells with promyelocytic features; ii) the invariable association with specific translocations which always involve chromosome 17 and the Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha (RAR alpha) locus; iii) the exquisite sensitivity of APL blasts to the differentiating action of Retinoic Acid (RA). These features have led APL to become the paradigm for therapeutic approaches utilizing differentiating agents. The last 5 years have provided crucial insights into the molecular basis of APL. RAR alpha translocates in 99% of cases to a gene located on chromosome 15 that we initially named myl and subsequently has been called PML. In a few cases, RAR alpha variably translocates to chromosome 11 where it fuses to the PLZF gene or to a newly described partner, NuMA. In addition, RAR alpha is also found translocated to chromosome 5 where it fuses to the NPM gene. The cloning of variant translocations in APL and the comparative analysis of their associated products is crucial for the understanding of the molecular etiopathogenesis of the disease. The generation of animal models, i.e., transgenic mice expressing the fusion genes, will be instrumental in determining the precise contribution of these fusion genes to leukemogenesis. In fact, mice harboring a PML/RAR alpha transgene whose expression is specifically targeted to the myeloid-promyelocytic lineage develop acute myeloid leukemia with promyelocytic features. Moreover, the functional analysis of the various fusion proteins, as well as RAR alpha partners, is revealing striking common features beneath a misleading structural heterogeneity which unravels a possible unifying molecular mechanism towards APL leukemogenesis.","['Department of Human Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",,,91,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seems clear that HOX genes are expressed in stage- and lineage-specific patterns during early stages of hematopoietic development and differentiation. Several lines of evidence suggest that multiple genes of the HOXB (B2, B4, B6-B9), HOXC (C6, C8), and HOXA (A5) are involved in erythropoiesis. Similarly, a number of genes of the HOXA, HOXB, and HOXC appear to play a role in lymphoid cells. Furthermore, several genes, such as A9, A10, B3, B7, and B8, may control myelomonocytic differentiation. The question arises as to whether such a multiplicity of HOX genes reflects redundancy or indicates subtlety of the regulatory machinary. A similar complexity has been observed for hematopoietic cytokines, and the current view is that, although multiple molecules may have similar or overlapping effects, each factor has a specific function and regulatory combinations appear to play a critical role in controlling hematopoietic cell processes (99). One challenge for the future is to delineate in more detail the precise expression patterns of these genes in the many distinct subpopulations of blood cells and during fetal development. Overexpression of HOX genes in hematopoietic cells can dramatically perturb the differentiation of various cell lineages and can contribute to leukemogenesis. Future studies may involve the overexpression of alternatively spliced versions of different HOX genes or of truncated versions of HOX genes to ascertain the functional domains of the proteins that mediate the biologic effects. The findings in HOX knockout mice confirm a role for these genes in normal blood cell development. Further work in this area will require careful examination of fetal hematopoiesis and of animals bearing multiple HOX gene knockouts. Involvement of HOX genes in leukemia is just beginning to be appreciated. Establishing the true extent of HOX gene mutations in human disease will require strategies such as comparative genomic hybridization (100) and analysis of high density oligonucleotide arrays (101). The holy grail of homeobox work is to discover the physiologic processes and specific target genes regulated by HOX proteins. Given the broad range of tissues in which HOX genes are expressed, they would appear to be involved in very basic cellular processes, e.g., cell proliferation and death, adhesion, and migration, etc., rather than the direct regulation of tissue-specific genes. The search for target genes may be made easier by the further characterization of cooperative DNA binding between HOX proteins and other transcription factors. We speculate that HOX proteins do not behave as conventional transcriptional activators or inhibitors but rather may mark genes for potential future activation, i.e., they may establish competency to execute specific differentiation programs, with the actual activation being accomplished by transcriptional pathways triggered by exogenous signals. This proposed function may be an architectural one, involving changes in the conformation of DNA and/or altering interactions between DNA and histones, thus making areas of the genome more or less accessible to other protein factors (102). If this is the case, we may need to develop new assays to discern the molecular action of HOX proteins. The ease of manipulating the hematopoietic systems would appear to make it a very attractive model for explicating the general functions of this remarkable family of genes.","['Institute of Mutagenesis and Differentiation, CNR, Pisa, Italy.']",,['R01DK48642/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],102,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show that this deregulated expression results from a deletion within chromosome 5.

We have demonstrated that 5' half of Af4 encodes a region with transcriptional transactivation activity which is disrupted by the t(4;11) in human leukemias. We have also localized the murine AF4 protein to the nucleus supporting a role for AF4 in transcription. The developmental expression pattern of Af4 was determined in situ hybridization and suggests Af4 plays an important role in the development of the hematopoietic, cardiovascular, skeletal and central nervous systems. A repeating pattern of Af4 expression in development is down-regulation with differentiation of a tissue. Among the cell types where this pattern of down-regulation is noted are B-lymphocytes. These findings raise the possibility that the disruption of normal AF4 function by the translocation may contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",,['R29 CA 65911-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['GENBANK/AF013131'],,,,,,,,,,,

In normal human adipose tissue, expression of the CYP19 gene which encodes aromatase P450, the enzyme responsible for estrogen biosynthesis, is regulated by a distal promoter, namely promoter I.4. Stimulation of expression in adipose stromal cells by members of the type 1 cytokine family, i.e. interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M (OSM), is mediated via a Jak-STAT3 signaling pathway and a GAS element upstream of promoter I.4. In contrast, aromatase expression in breast adipose tissue proximal to tumor is increased three- to four-fold to the utilization of another promoter, namely promoter II, proximal to the translation initiation site. In the present report, we show that prostaglandin (PG) E2 is the most potent factor which stimulates aromatase expression via cyclic AMP and promoter II. PGE2 acts via EP1 and EP2 receptor subtypes to stimulate both the PKC and PKA pathways. The combined stimulation of both of these pathways results in the maximal expression of promoter II-specific CYP19 transcripts. Because PGE2 is a major secretory product both of breast tumor epithelial cells and fibroblasts, as well as of macrophages infiltrating the tumor site, then this could be the mechanism whereby estrogen biosynthesis is stimulated in breast sites adjacent to a tumor, leading in turn to increased growth and development of the tumor itself.","['Cecil H. and Ida Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences, and the Department of Obstetrics/Gynecology, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9051, U.S.A.']",,"['5-T32-HD07190/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R37AG08174/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data were analysed using conditional logistic regression and the associations are expressed in terms of adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals. Cases were born to mothers of a higher standard education, the OR for an increment of four schooling years being 1.48 (1.17-1.87) and had higher birth weight, the OR for an increment of 500g being 1.36 (1.04-1.77). Pet ownership and birth after a pregnancy with anaemia were associated with increased risk, the ORs being 2.18 (1.14-4.16) and 2.60 (1.39-4.86) respectively. From the frequency analyses, indicative inverse associations were found with birth order, household crowding and previous hospitalization with allergic diseases, whereas indicative positive associations were found with diabetes mellitus during pregnancy and with neonatal jaundice. Substantial or significant elevations were not found with respect to maternal smoking and coffee drinking during pregnancy, diagnostic radiography and ultrasonographic examinations or blood transfusions. A significant inverse association with maternal consumption of alcohol could be due to multiple comparisons, but a detrimental effect can probably be excluded. A non-significant positive association with total shots of viral vaccinations and a weak non-significant inverse association with breast feeding were also found. We interpret the findings of this study as being compatible with acute childhood leukaemia being linked with delayed development of herd immunity to fairly common infectious agents, in conjunction with accelerated perinatal and early post-natal growth.","['Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Athens University Medical School, Greece.']",,,,,PMC2228112,,,,,,,,,,

Early intensive chemotherapy is generally regarded to be necessary for achieving high complete remission (CR) rates. Recent experience has shown that incorporation of early intensification with high-dose melphalan conditioning and autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) during the first remission significantly improves long-term DFS in children with AML. In this article, we report the use of autologous BMT for treatment of a three-and-half year old child with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL or M3) in second remission.

She again relapsed with AML with myelodysplasia, and an abnormal complex karyotype was newly detected. She eventually died without further chemotherapy. We performed FISH on the patient's stained bone marrow smears using DNA probes for chromosome 8 and Y to analyze the clonality. The results showed that the most of blasts and bone marrow cells except lymphoid cells were of trisomy 8 at onset, while in the 1st remission, trisomy 8 clone was slightly detected only in monocytes. At 1st and 2nd relapse, trisomy 8 clone was detected again in most of myeloid cells. Thus, in this case, it was considered that underlying stem cell disorder with trisomy 8 during the entire disease course contributed to leukemogenesis.","['First Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The girl has since shown normal development, with no peripheral blood abnormalities at 2 years old. Hypersegmented neutrophils, which often appear during ATRA treatment, were seen in the peripheral blood of the mother and cord blood but not peripheral blood of the neonate on the day of birth. ATRA is known to cross the placenta, and has been revealed to be teratogenic in animal studies. There have been eight neonates born to the mothers with APL who were treated with ATRA during pregnancy.

Inhibition of the es process arises from binding of NBMPR to a high-affinity site(s) on the es transporter that can be identified by photoaffinity labeling with [3H]NBMPR. This study examined the equilibrative nucleoside transport processes of cultured human erythroleukemia (K562) cells. The presence of NBMPR binding sites (4.8 +/- 0.9 x 10(5)/cell, Kd = 0.3 nM), together with the identification of polypeptides by specific photolabeling of membranes with [3H]NBMPR, indicated that K562 cells possess es nucleoside transporters (ca 500,000 copies/cell). The photolabeled polypeptides of K562 cells migrated with lower relative mobility (peak M(r) value, 63,000) than did those of human erythrocytes (peak M(r) value, 53,000). This difference in apparent M(r) was abolished by prolonged treatment of membrane proteins with N-glycosidase F, suggesting that equilibrative nucleoside transport in K562 cells and erythrocytes is mediated by the same, or a closely related, es isoform. A cDNA encoding the es nucleoside transporter of human placenta (termed hENT1) was recently isolated by a strategy based on the N-terminal sequence of the es transporter of human erythrocytes. hENT-like mRNA species were detected in K562 cells, as well as in several other human cell lines of neoplastic origin (A459, G361, HeLa, HL-60, Molt-4, Raji, SW480), by high-stringency northern analysis with a placental hENT1 probe. A cDNA that encoded a protein identical to hENT1 was isolated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for hENT1. NBMPR inhibited zero-trans influx of 3H-labeled adenosine, uridine and thymidine by 50% (IC50 values) at 0.4-1.0 nM, confirming the presence of an NBMPR-sensitive (es) transport process, which accounted for 80-90% of total transport activity. The remaining component was identified as the equilibrative NBMPR-insensitive (ei) transport process since it: (i) exhibited low (IC50 > 1.0 microM) sensitivity to NBMPR; (ii) was not concentrative; and (iii) was unchanged by elimination of the sodium gradient. The kinetic parameters (determined at 37 degrees C) for the es- and ei-mediated processes differed markedly. Values for transport of uridine by the es- and ei-mediated processes were, respectively: K(m) = 229 +/- 39 and 1077 +/- 220 microM; Vmax, 186 +/- 31 and 40 +/- 5 pmol/microliter cell water/sec.

Patients suffering from haematologic malignancy treated by chemotherapy through a central venous catheter are at even greater risk of catheter-related bacteraemia. A prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial was performed in order to investigate the effectiveness of chlorhexidine and silver-sulfadiazine impregnated catheters (CH-SS) in these patients. A total of 680 catheters (13,826 catheter days) were inserted, of which 338 were antiseptic impregnated. Bloodstream infection was observed in 105 cases with an overall risk of 7.6 per 1000 catheter days. Thirty-two infections (30.5%) were catheter-related, corresponding to a risk of 2.3 per 1000 catheter days. There was no statistically significant different between the overall rates of bloodstream infection for impregnated and non-impregnated catheters (14.5 vs. 16.3%). The incidence of catheter-related infection was also similar in both groups (5 vs. 4.4%) and there was no difference in the time of the onset of bacteraemia in the two groups. It is concluded that the use of CH-SS catheters in patients with haematologic malignancy reduces neither the overall risk of bloodstream infection, nor the catheter-related infection rate, nor the delay for the occurrence of infection.","['Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.']","['J Hosp Infect. 1998 Apr;38(4):322-4.

The parameters for function which are indicative for obstructive and restrictive lung disease deteriorated in all patient groups during the first 3 to 6 months after BMT but partially recovered within one year. Long-term decline in lung function was similar in all patient groups, and neither the onset nor the magnitude of pulmonary dysfunction was related to the occurrence of pulmonary impairment within 6 months after grafting. Multivariate analysis was then employed to assess predictors for long-term pulmonary disease. Despite the obvious effect of chronic graft versus host disease on the course of lung function, it was in itself not a significant predictor of long-term pulmonary outcome. Rather, the conditioning regimen turned out to be indicative; compared with busulfan, fractionated total body irradiation was demonstrated to be clearly superior with a lower incidence of both restrictive and obstructive long-term lung impairment. Our data indicate a previously unknown long-term side effect of busulfan conditioning.","['Universitats-Klinikum Charite, Zentrum fur Innere Medizin, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Schumannstr. 20-21, Berlin D-10117, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The findings suggest that internucleosomal DNA fragmentation is not a universal biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. Removal of Ca2+ ions from the culture medium significantly reduced the cytotoxic activity of sodium ascorbate, but not that of H2O2. H2O2 significantly elevated the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, with or without Ca2+ in the culture medium. This suggests that sodium ascorbate and H2O2 initiate cell death by different mechanisms. Induction of apoptosis in in vitro systems might be useful in studying the pathogenesis of allergy or asthma.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
