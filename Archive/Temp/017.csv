Moreover, most of the available information on the normal function of these proteases has been derived from studies in model organisms. Recently, the mitochondrial proteases caseinolytic protease P (CLPP) and neurolysin (NLN) have been identified as therapeutic targets in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Both proteases are overexpressed in approximately 40% of AML patients. Mechanistically, CLPP and NLN maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain: CLPP cleaves defective respiratory chain proteins, while NLN promotes the formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes.

METHODS: We analyzed three cases of anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy among 996 patients with either acute myelogenous leukemia (285), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (37), or malignant lymphoma (674) at our hospital during the period from 2006 to 2016. RESULTS: All patients showed accumulation of anthracycline within a proper range (< 500 mg/sqm). Two patients (Hodgkin lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia) showed acute heart failure (AHF) with ejection fraction (EF) of 30 and 40% after 4.5 and 5 years after diagnosis, respectively. For AHF, diuretics and carperitide were administered to control in-out balance. The remaining patient (follicular lymphoma) showed ventricular fibrillation (VF)/ventricular tachycardia (VT) with EF of 40% at 5 years after diagnosis. In this patient, immediate cardioversion made VF/VT to normal sinus rhythm, and then, amiodarone was given. Furthermore, implantable cardioverter defibrillator was set up for VF/VT. In all patients, beta blocker and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) were administrated to prevent recurrence of anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy. Consequently, two of three patients showed mild improvement of cardiac function. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that late-onset (4 to 5 years) anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy can develop, though range of anthracycline accumulation is in proper range. Thus, a cautious follow-up by ECG and UCG is required. Furthermore, the early treatment after the onset of anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy should be also needed to improve the poor outcome.","['Kawano, Noriaki', 'Kawano, Sayaka', 'Yoshida, Shuro', 'Kuriyama, Takuro', 'Tochigi, Taro', 'Nakaike, Takashi', 'Shimokawa, Tomonori', 'Yamashita, Kiyoshi', 'Ochiai, Hidenobu', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Mashiba, Koichi', 'Kikuchi, Ikuo']","['Kawano N', 'Kawano S', 'Yoshida S', 'Kuriyama T', 'Tochigi T', 'Nakaike T', 'Shimokawa T', 'Yamashita K', 'Ochiai H', 'Shimoda K', 'Mashiba K', 'Kikuchi I']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, 5-30 Kitatakamatsu, Miyazaki, 880-8510, Japan. kawanoriaki@yahoo.co.jp.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, 5-30 Kitatakamatsu, Miyazaki, 880-8510, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, 5-30 Kitatakamatsu, Miyazaki, 880-8510, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, 5-30 Kitatakamatsu, Miyazaki, 880-8510, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, 5-30 Kitatakamatsu, Miyazaki, 880-8510, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, 5-30 Kitatakamatsu, Miyazaki, 880-8510, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, 5-30 Kitatakamatsu, Miyazaki, 880-8510, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, 5-30 Kitatakamatsu, Miyazaki, 880-8510, Japan.', 'Trauma and Critical Care Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, 5-30 Kitatakamatsu, Miyazaki, 880-8510, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, 5-30 Kitatakamatsu, Miyazaki, 880-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Echocardiogr,Journal of echocardiography,101263153,['0 (Anthracyclines)'],IM,"['Anthracyclines/adverse effects', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Humans', '*Tachycardia, Ventricular', 'Ventricular Fibrillation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute heart failure', '*Anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy', '*ICD', '*Proper range of accumulation of anthracycline', '*VF/VT']",2020/08/08 06:00,2021/10/29 06:00,['2020/08/08 06:00'],"['2020/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12574-020-00484-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s12574-020-00484-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Echocardiogr. 2021 Mar;19(1):45-52. doi: 10.1007/s12574-020-00484-8.

Although we could not complete this trial because of recruitment difficulties, we treated five children with first-relapsed T-ALL which were enrolled in the phase 1 dose escalation study of fludarabine and etoposide with nelarabine. No dose-limiting toxicity occurred, and frequent grade 3-4 toxicity was hematological toxicity and febrile neutropenia, as expected. There was no neurotoxicity.

OBJECTIVE: These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about management of AML in older adults. METHODS: ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that included specialists in myeloid leukemia, geriatric oncology, patient-reported outcomes and decision-making, frailty, epidemiology, and methodology, as well as patients. The McMaster Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Centre supported the guideline-development process, including performing systematic evidence reviews (up to 24 May 2019). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance to patients, as judged by the panel. The panel used the GRADE approach, including GRADE's Evidence-to-Decision frameworks, to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 6 critical questions in managing older adults with AML, mirroring real-time practitioner-patient conversations: the decision to pursue antileukemic treatment vs best supportive management, the intensity of therapy, the role and duration of postremission therapy, combination vs monotherapy for induction and beyond, duration of less-intensive therapy, and the role of transfusion support for patients no longer receiving antileukemic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment is recommended over best supportive management. More-intensive therapy is recommended over less-intensive therapy when deemed tolerable. However, these recommendations are guided by the principle that throughout a patient's disease course, optimal care involves ongoing discussions between clinicians and patients, continuously addressing goals of care and the relative risk-benefit balance of treatment.","['Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Guyatt, Gordon', 'Abel, Gregory', 'Alibhai, Shabbir', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Buckstein, Rena', 'Choe, Hannah', 'Desai, Pinkal', 'Erba, Harry', 'Hourigan, Christopher S', 'LeBlanc, Thomas W', 'Litzow, Mark', 'MacEachern, Janet', 'Michaelis, Laura C', 'Mukherjee, Sudipto', ""O'Dwyer, Kristen"", 'Rosko, Ashley', 'Stone, Richard', 'Agarwal, Arnav', 'Colunga-Lozano, L E', 'Chang, Yaping', 'Hao, QiuKui', 'Brignardello-Petersen, Romina']","['Sekeres MA', 'Guyatt G', 'Abel G', 'Alibhai S', 'Altman JK', 'Buckstein R', 'Choe H', 'Desai P', 'Erba H', 'Hourigan CS', 'LeBlanc TW', 'Litzow M', 'MacEachern J', 'Michaelis LC', 'Mukherjee S', ""O'Dwyer K"", 'Rosko A', 'Stone R', 'Agarwal A', 'Colunga-Lozano LE', 'Chang Y', 'Hao Q', 'Brignardello-Petersen R']","['Leukemia Program, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Leukemia Division, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Institute of Medical Sciences, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Odette Cancer Centre, Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Medicine, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC.', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Grand River Regional Cancer Centre, Kitchener, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Leukemia Program, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Leukemia Division, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Health Science Center, Department of Clinical Medicine, Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Mexico; and.', 'Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'The Center of Gerontology and Geriatrics/National Clinical Research Center for Geriatrics, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Aged', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', '*Hematology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/therapy', 'United States', '*Venous Thromboembolism']",,,2020/08/08 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/08/08 06:00'],"['2020/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31580-9 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001920 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Aug 11;4(15):3528-3549. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001920.,,,,,,PMC7422124,,['Blood Adv. 2020 Nov 10;4(21):5431-5432.

However, there is a gap in the knowledge about the mechanisms that regulate the expression of such host factors. Here, we aimed to assess DNA methylation impact on host genome in natural HIV-1 control. To this end, whole DNA methylome in 70 untreated HIV-1 infected individuals with either high (>50,000 HIV-1-RNA copies/ml, n = 29) or low (<10,000 HIV-1-RNA copies/ml, n = 41) plasma viral load (pVL) levels were compared and identified 2,649 differentially methylated positions (DMPs). Of these, a classification random forest model selected 55 DMPs that correlated with virologic (pVL and proviral levels) and HIV-1 specific adaptive immunity parameters (IFNg-T cell responses and neutralizing antibodies capacity). Then, cluster and functional analyses identified two DMP clusters: cluster 1 contained hypo-methylated genes involved in antiviral and interferon response (e.g. PARP9, MX1, and USP18) in individuals with high viral loads while in cluster 2, genes related to T follicular helper cell (Tfh) commitment (e.g. CXCR5 and TCF7) were hyper-methylated in the same group of individuals with uncontrolled infection. For selected genes, mRNA levels negatively correlated with DNA methylation, confirming an epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Further, these gene expression signatures were also confirmed in early and chronic stages of infection, including untreated, cART treated and elite controllers HIV-1 infected individuals (n = 37). These data provide the first evidence that host genes critically involved in immune control of the virus are under methylation regulation in HIV-1 infection. These insights may offer new opportunities to identify novel mechanisms of in vivo virus control and may prove crucial for the development of future therapeutic interventions aimed at HIV-1 cure.","['Oriol-Tordera, Bruna', 'Berdasco, Maria', 'Llano, Anuska', 'Mothe, Beatriz', 'Galvez, Cristina', 'Martinez-Picado, Javier', 'Carrillo, Jorge', 'Blanco, Julia', 'Duran-Castells, Clara',

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2018, 96 AML patients aged 65 and above who received decitabine treatment at 6 centers in Korea were retrospectively evaluated. Response rates, hematologic improvements (HI), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 73.9 years, and the median number of decitabine treatments administered to the patients was 4 (range, 1-29). Of 85 patients, 15 patients (17.6%) achieved complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count recovery. Twelve patients (14.1%) showed partial remission (PR), and 18 (21.2%) demonstrated HI without an objective response. The median PFS and OS were 7.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.9-9.0) and 10.6 (95% CI, 7.7-13.5%) months, respectively. In multivariate analyses, MNA-SF score >/= 8 and the absence of peripheral blood (PB) blasts were significant predictors for improved PFS and OS. CONCLUSIONS: For older patients with newly diagnosed AML, a high MNA-SF score and the absence of PB blasts were independently associated with improved survival.","['Yoo, Kwai Han', 'Cho, Jinhyun', 'Han, Boram', 'Kim, Se Hyung', 'Shin, Dong-Yeop', 'Hong, Junshik', 'Kim, Hawk', 'Kim, Hyo Jung', 'Zang, Dae Young', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Jin, Jong-Youl', 'Lee, Jae Hoon', 'Hong, Dae-Sik', 'Park, Seong Kyu']","['Yoo KH', 'Cho J', 'Han B', 'Kim SH', 'Shin DY', 'Hong J', 'Kim H', 'Kim HJ', 'Zang DY', 'Yoon SS', 'Jin JY', 'Lee JH', 'Hong DS', 'Park SK']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Inha University Hospital, Inha University School of Medicine, Incheon, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Korea.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, Bucheon, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', ""Division of Hemato-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Bucheon St. Mary's Hospital, Bucheon, Korea."", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, Bucheon, Korea.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital, Bucheon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Decitabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Remission Induction/*methods', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Weight Loss']",,,2020/08/08 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2020/08/08 06:00'],"['2020/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0235503 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-00626 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Aug 6;15(8):e0235503. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0235503. eCollection 2020.,,20200806,,,,PMC7410295,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],['figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.12038748'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though several risk classifications have been used, some factors are unavailable until the start of conditioning or transplantation. We analyzed prognostic gene mutations by targeted next-generation sequencing to identify predisposing factors for predicting OS at 1 month before transplantation. We enrolled 120 patients with nonremission AML who underwent first allo-HSCT between 2005 and 2018. Mutations were found in 98 patients; frequently mutated genes were FLT3-ITD, TP53, RUNX1, and WT1. TP53 mutation was detected in 21 patients and was the only predictor of poor OS. Multivariate analysis using Cox regression hazard model revealed primary AML, monosomal karyotype (MK), and TP53 mutation as independent factors for predicting poor OS. Based on these, patients were stratified into three groups. The low-risk group included patients with prior myeloid disorder without MK (n = 26). Among the rest, patients with TP53 mutation were assigned to the high-risk group (n = 19) and the rest into the intermediate-risk group (n = 75). Two-year OS in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups differed significantly (50.0%, 24.9%, and 0%, respectively).

For instance, Human T Lymphotropic virus (HTLV) is a well-studied class of oncoviruses causing T cell leukemia, while human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) leads to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is linked to a series of defining cancers including Kaposi sarcoma, certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cervical cancer. Of note, in addition to these ""modern"" exogenous retroviruses, our genome harbors a staggering number of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). HERVs are the genetic remnants of ancient retroviral germline infection of human ancestors and are typically silenced in normal tissues due to inactivating mutations and sequence loss. While some HERV elements have been appropriated and contribute to human physiological functions, others can be reactivated through epigenetic dysregulations to express retroviral elements and promote carcinogenesis. Conversely, HERV replication intermediates or protein products can also serve as intrinsic pathogen-associated molecular patterns that cause the immune system to interpret it as an exogenous infection, thereby stimulating immune responses against tumors. As such, HERVs have also been targeted as a potential internal strategy to sensitize tumor cells for promising immunotherapies. In this review, we discuss the dynamic role of human retroviruses in cancer development, focusing on HIV and HERVs contribution. We also describe potential treatment strategies, including immunotherapeutic targeting of HERVs, inhibiting DNA methylation to expose HERV signatures, and the use of antiretroviral drugs against HIV and HERVs, which can be employed as prospective anti-cancer modalities.","['Liu, Ching-Hsuan', 'Grandi, Nicole', 'Palanivelu, Lalitha', 'Tramontano, Enzo', 'Lin, Liang-Tzung']","['Liu CH', 'Grandi N', 'Palanivelu L', 'Tramontano E', 'Lin LT']","['Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Cagliari, Monserrato, 09042 Cagliari, Italy.', 'International Master Program in Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Cagliari, Monserrato, 09042 Cagliari, Italy.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 11031, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,['0 (Anti-Retroviral Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Retroviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'HIV Infections/complications/drug therapy/*virology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*virology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retroviridae Infections/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*antiviral strategies', '*cancer treatment', '*carcinogenesis', '*human endogenous retroviruses', '*human immunodeficiency virus', '*immunotherapy']",2020/08/08 06:00,2021/02/25 06:00,['2020/08/08 06:00'],"['2020/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['v12080852 [pii]', '10.3390/v12080852 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2020 Aug 4;12(8). pii: v12080852. doi: 10.3390/v12080852.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5074-1785', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0666-4361', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1998-6127', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4849-0980', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7374-7234']",20200804,,,,PMC7472297,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Demethoxycurcumin (DMC) and diphenyl difluoroketone (EF-24) are natural and synthetic curcumin analogues, respectively, with better solubilities and higher anti-carcinogenic activities in various solid tumors than CUR. However, the efficacy of these analogues against non-solid tumors, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), has not been fully investigated. Herein, we observed that both DMC and EF-24 significantly decrease the proportion of viable AML cells including HL-60, U937, and MV4-11, harboring different NRAS and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) statuses, and that EF-24 has a lower half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) than DMC. We found that EF-24 treatment induces several features of apoptosis, including an increase in the sub-G1 population, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, and significant activation of extrinsic proapoptotic signaling such as caspase-8 and -3 activation. Mechanistically, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation is critical for EF-24-triggered apoptosis via activating protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to attenuate extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK) activities in HL-60 AML cells. In the clinic, patients with AML expressing high level of PP2A have the most favorable prognoses compared to various solid tumors. Taken together, our results indicate that EF-24 is a potential therapeutic agent for treating AML, especially for cancer types that lose the function of the PP2A tumor suppressor.","['Hsiao, Pei-Ching', 'Chang, Jer-Hwa', 'Lee, Wei-Jiunn', 'Ku, Chia-Chi', 'Tsai, Meng-Ying', 'Yang, Shun-Fa', 'Chien, Ming-Hsien']","['Hsiao PC', 'Chang JH', 'Lee WJ', 'Ku CC', 'Tsai MY', 'Yang SF', 'Chien MH']","['School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 402, Taiwan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung 402, Taiwan.', 'School of Respiratory Therapy, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 116, Taiwan.', 'Pulmonary Research Center, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 116, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 116, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 402, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung 402, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 402, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung 402, Taiwan.', 'Pulmonary Research Center, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 116, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan.', 'TMU Research Center of Cancer Translational Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei 110, Taiwan.', 'Traditional Herbal Medicine Research Center, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei 110, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['EF-24', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'extracellular-regulated protein kinase', 'p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase', 'protein phosphatase 2 a']",2020/08/08 06:00,2020/08/08 06:01,['2020/08/08 06:00'],"['2020/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/08 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12082163 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12082163 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Aug 4;12(8). pii: cancers12082163. doi: 10.3390/cancers12082163.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1306-2089', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0365-7927']",20200804,,,,PMC7464750,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On post-transplantation day 30, she showed weight gain, hepatomegaly, right hypochondriac pain, and ascites. On day 35, ultrasonography (US) revealed portal vein regurgitation. She was subsequently diagnosed with late-onset sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) on day 36 for multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation, requiring mechanical ventilation. Her SOS was graded as very severe upon ICU admission. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (380 U/kg/day) and methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) therapies were initiated. Additionally, her intra-abdominal pressure had increased to 19 mmHg, which was thought to be the cause of MODS.

The speciation of sedimentary W was determined by mu-XRF mapping and mu-XANES. The W content of the analyzed surface sediments ranged between 81 and 25,908 mg/kg, which is significantly higher than the W content in deeper sediments which ranged from 37 to 373 mg/kg at 30 cm depth. The mu-XANES findings reveal that approximately 20-50% of the total W in the shallow sediment occurs in the metallic form (W(0)); the rest occurs in the oxide form (W(VI)O3). Because W(0) does not occur naturally, its elevated concentrations in surface sediments point toward a possible local anthropogenic origin. The oxidation of metallic W(0) with meteoric waters likely leads to the formation of W(VI)O3. The chief water-soluble W species was identified as WO4(2-) by chromatographic separation and speciation modeling. These results led us to postulate that W(0) particles from a currently unknown but local source(s) is (are) deposited onto the soils and/or surface sediments. The W(0) in interaction with meteoric water is oxidized to W(VI)O3, and as these sediment-water interactions progress, WO4(2-) is formed in the water at pH approximately 7. Under pH < 7, and sufficient W concentrations, tungstate tends to polymerize, and polymerized species are less likely to adsorb onto sediments. Polymerized species have lower affinity than monomers, which leads to enhanced mobility of W.","['Hobson, Chad', 'Kulkarni, Harshad V', 'Johannesson, Karen H', 'Bednar, Anthony', 'Tappero, Ryan', 'Mohajerin, T Jade', 'Sheppard, Paul R', 'Witten, Mark L', 'Hettiarachchi, Ganga M', 'Datta, Saugata']","['Hobson C', 'Kulkarni HV', 'Johannesson KH', 'Bednar A', 'Tappero R', 'Mohajerin TJ', 'Sheppard PR', 'Witten ML', 'Hettiarachchi GM', 'Datta S']","['Department of Geology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, 66506, USA.', 'Department of Geology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, 66506, USA; Department of Geological Sciences, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, 78249, USA.

Multiply transfused patients with SCD represent significant risk of acquiring parenterally transmitted infections. The analysis of the virome profile of high-risk multiply transfused patients with SCD can reveal the presence of parenterally transmitted viruses and therefore be used an indirect approach for evaluation of blood transfusion safety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 45 patients with SCD receiving multiple transfusions and analyzed by metagenomic analyses. The samples were assembled in pools f which were submitted to nucleic acids extraction and sequencing by Illumina NextSeq 550 equipment. For bioinformatic analysis, we used a specific in-house developed pipeline specialized in identification of emerging viruses. RESULTS: The virome composition of SCD patients revealed the presence of commensal viruses represented by anelloviruses and Human Pegivirus-1 (HPgV-1, GB virus C). Contaminant viral sequences belonging to human lentiviruses (rev, env genes), cytomegalovirus and murine leukemia virus were also identified and are attributed to vectors used in the laboratory practice. No novel or unsuspected pathogenic viruses were identified. CONCLUSION: This study evaluates for the first time the virome of multiply transfused patients with SCD. Exclusively genetic material of commensal viruses was annotated. Therefore, we believe that viral metagenomics applied in patients with high risk for acquiring parenterally transmitted infections can serve as a direct indicator for evaluation of transfusion safety.","['Nunes Valenca, I', 'Silva-Pinto, A C', 'Araujo da Silva Junior, W', 'Tadeu Covas, D', 'Kashima, S', 'Nanev Slavov, S']","['Nunes Valenca I', 'Silva-Pinto AC', 'Araujo da Silva Junior W', 'Tadeu Covas D', 'Kashima S', 'Nanev Slavov S']","['Post-graduation program in clinical oncology, stem cells and cell therapy, Faculty of Medicine in Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Blood Center of Ribeirao Preto, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Blood Center of Ribeirao Preto, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Blood Center of Ribeirao Preto, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Blood Center of Ribeirao Preto, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Blood Center of Ribeirao Preto, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

(A. annua) has been used for the treatment of various diseases since ancient times, including intermittent fevers due to malaria, bone steaming and heat/fever arising from exhaustion, tuberculosis, lice, wounds, scabies, dysentery et al. With the discovery of artemisinin and its excellent anti-malarial activity, A. annua has received great attention. Recently, A. annua has been revealed to show inhibitory effects against parasites (e.g. Plasmodium, Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania, Acanthamoeba, Schistosoma), viruses (e.g. hepatitis A virus, herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, human immunodeficiency virus), fungi (Candida, Malassezia, Saccharomyces spp.) and bacteria (Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Listeria, Haemophilus, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia spp.). A. annua has also been reported to possess anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer actions and been employed for the treatment of osteoarthritis, leukemia, colon cancer, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancre and hepatoma. Besides, the immunoregulation, anti-adipogenic, anti-ulcerogenic, anti-asthmatic, anti-nociceptive and anti-osteoporotic activities of A. annua were also evaluated. Along these lines, this review summarizes the traditional application and modern pharmacological research of A. annua, providing novel insights of A. annua in the treatment of various diseases.","['Feng, Xinchi', 'Cao, Shijie', 'Qiu, Feng', 'Zhang, Boli']","['Feng X', 'Cao S', 'Qiu F', 'Zhang B']","['School of Chinese Materia Medica, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, PR China.', 'Tianjin State Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, PR China.', 'School of Chinese Materia Medica, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, PR China; Tianjin State Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, PR China.

However, relatively few reports have linked these processes. Recent studies have indicated that therapies that overcome differentiation arrest represent an effective treatment strategy. Here, we identified that the disruption of the mitochondrial mass and energy metabolism promotes leukaemia cellular myeloid differentiation. In this study, we showed that acute monocytic leukaemia (AML-M5) cells package mitochondria in microvesicles (MVs) when MVs shed from membranes. Additionally, during myeloid differentiation, we report for the first time that differentiated leukaemia cells release more MVs than undifferentiated leukaemia cells. Targeting the formation of MVs using a specific inhibitor (Y-27632) restrained myeloid differentiation, suggesting that the increased release level of MVs plays an important role in regulating myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, the intracellular mitochondria and ATP levels were decreased after leukaemia cells overcame the differentiation blockade. Moreover, rotenone, which is used to inhibit the respiratory chain and ATP production, had a strong effect on myeloid differentiation in monocytic leukaemia cells. Collectively, these studies uncovered the relationship between mitochondrial function and myeloid differentiation and may provide more insight into the diagnosis and treatment of AML.","['Zhao, Fan', 'Sun, Luchen', 'Yang, Nanfei', 'Zheng, Wei', 'Shen, Pingping', 'Huang, Yahong', 'Lu, Yan']","['Zhao F', 'Sun L', 'Yang N', 'Zheng W', 'Shen P', 'Huang Y', 'Lu Y']","['State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The Affiliated Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The Affiliated Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The Affiliated Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The Affiliated Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The Affiliated Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, The Affiliated Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210023, China.

We aimed to examine the safety and preliminary activity of avadomide plus obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma. METHODS: CC-122-NHL-001 was a phase 1b dose escalation and expansion study at eight sites in France, Italy, and the Netherlands. Eligible patients (aged >/=18 years) had histologically confirmed CD20-positive relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and had received previous treatment. In the dose expansion phase, only patients with previously treated relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (grade 1, 2, or 3a) were included. Avadomide was administered in escalating doses and two formulations: active pharmaceutical ingredient in capsule in 1.0 mg, 2.0 mg, 3.0 mg, and 4.0 mg doses and as formulated capsules in 3.0 mg and 4.0 mg doses orally once daily on days 1-5 followed by 2 days off (5-7-day schedule) every week of each 28-day cycle. Obinutuzumab 1000 mg was administered intravenously on days 2, 8, and 15 of cycle 1 and day 1 of cycles 2-8. Primary objectives were to determine the safety and tolerability, the non-tolerated dose, maximum tolerated dose, and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). All patients who received treatment were included in the safety analyses. Efficacy-evaluable patients completed at least one cycle of treatment and had baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02417285 and EudraCT 2014-003333-26, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between June 24, 2015, and Dec 5, 2018, 73 patients were enrolled and treated; 19 had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 53 follicular lymphoma, and one marginal zone lymphoma. Median follow-up was 253 days (IQR 127-448). The median number of previous anticancer regimens was three (IQR 2-4). The maximum tolerated dose and non-tolerated dose were not reached in the dose escalation phase. On the basis of safety and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data, the avadomide RP2D was established as 3.0 mg as formulated capsules on a 5-7-day schedule in combination with 1000 mg of obinutuzumab. Patients enrolled in the expansion cohort received the established RP2D of avadomide. Across all doses, three patients had dose-limiting toxicities; one patient treated at the RP2D had dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 sepsis). The most common adverse events of grade 3 and above were neutropenia (41 [56%] of 73) and thrombocytopenia (17 [23%] of 73). 34 (47%) patients had serious adverse events, which were considered to be avadomide-related in 23 (32%) of 73 patients and obinutuzumab-related in 20 (27%) of 73 patients. Two treatment-related deaths occurred, one owing to tumour flare and one from acute myeloid leukaemia after study discontinuation. INTERPRETATION: Avadomide plus obinutuzumab has a manageable toxicity, being a tolerable treatment option for most patients. Although the prespecified threshold for activity was not met in the trial, we believe that the preliminary antitumour activity of cereblon modulators plus next-generation anti-CD20 antibodies in heavily pretreated relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma warrants further investigation as a chemotherapy-free option in this setting.

However, post-treatment data also provides much useful information. In this retrospective study, we explored whether the level of blood count recovery before and after the first minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete remission (CR) is relevant to clinical outcomes of AML patients. METHODS: For each included patient, peripheral platelet counts were measured on the day before initial treatment (PLTpre), whereas platelet peak values (PLTpeak) were recorded after marrow recovery following the chemotherapy course inducing the first MRD-negative CR. The difference (DPLT) between these two values (DPLT = PLTpeak-PLTpre) was calculated. X-tile software was utilized to establish the optimal cut-point for DPLT, which was expected to distinguish CR patients with different clinical outcomes. A cross validation analysis was conducted to confirm the robustness of the established cut-point. The results were further tested by a Cox multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The optimal cut-point of DPLT was determined as 212 x 10(9)/L. Patients in high DPLT group were observed to have a significantly better PFS (p = 0.016) and a better OS (without statistical significance, p = 0.106). Cox multivariate analysis showed that higher DPLT was associated with longer PFS (HR = 2.894, 95% CI: 1.320-6.345, p = 0.008) and longer OS (HR = 3.077, 95% CI: 1.130-8.376, p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: Platelet recovery degree before and after achieving MRD-negative CR (DPLT) is a potential predictor of clinical outcomes in CR patients. Higher DPLT value is associated with longer PFS and OS. Our findings may help to develop simple methods for AML prognosis evaluation.","['Wang, Yang', 'Wang, Hua', 'Wang, Weida', 'Liu, Wenjian', 'Liu, Nawei', 'Liu, Shuang', 'Lu, Yue']","['Wang Y', 'Wang H', 'Wang W', 'Liu W', 'Liu N', 'Liu S', 'Lu Y']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, 651 Dongfengdong Rd, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, 651 Dongfengdong Rd, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, 651 Dongfengdong Rd, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, 651 Dongfengdong Rd, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, 651 Dongfengdong Rd, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, 651 Dongfengdong Rd, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, 651 Dongfengdong Rd, Guangzhou, 510060, China. lvyue@sysucc.org.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China. lvyue@sysucc.org.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Blood Platelets', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'Complete remission (CR)', 'Overall survival (OS)', 'Platelet recovery degree', 'Progression free survival (PFS)']",2020/08/08 06:00,2021/02/23 06:00,['2020/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-020-07222-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-07222-4 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Aug 5;20(1):732. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-07222-4.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0466-9257'],20200805,,,"['30471976 and 81272620/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2016A020215086/Science and technology projects of Guangdong Province']",PMC7409648,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We measured burnout among pediatric oncology providers in the St Jude Affiliate network and used a Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) improvement cycle to address one of the factors contributing to burnout. METHODS: Within the framework of the ASCO Thematic Quality Training Program, we sent the Mini Z 2.0 Survey to 47 pediatric oncology providers. Applying a fishbone diagram and Pareto chart, we analyzed potential causes of provider burnout. On the basis of the analysis, we used a PDSA approach to address documentation of oral chemotherapy adherence for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia to mitigate burnout among providers. RESULTS: The burnout survey response rate was 44.6%. Burnout was identified in 42.9% of providers. Documentation in the electronic medical record (EMR) was cited as the second most common contributor to burnout, and it was this issue we chose to address according to a priority matrix. We improved the completeness of oral chemotherapy documentation from a baseline of 13% compliance to 87% compliance within 3 months. The improved compliance was achieved by standardizing the documentation process in the EMR for content and location. CONCLUSION: The EMR was one of the contributing factors in the burnout survey of the pediatric oncology providers in the St Jude Affiliate network. A PDSA improvement model to improve clinical research documentation was successful in addressing one of several contributing factors to provider burnout.","['Raney, Lauren', 'McManaman, Joanne', 'Elsaid, Mohamed', 'Morgan, Jennifer', 'Bowman, Ronda', 'Mohamed, Ashraf', 'Russo, Carolyn L']","['Raney L', 'McManaman J', 'Elsaid M', 'Morgan J', 'Bowman R', 'Mohamed A', 'Russo CL']","[""Department of Pediatrics, St Jude Affiliate Clinic at Our Lady of the Lake Children's Hospital, Baton Rouge, LA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, St Jude Affiliate Clinic at Novant Health Hemby Children's Hospital, Charlotte, NC."", 'Department of Pediatrics, St Jude Affiliate Clinic at Mercy Kids Hospital, Springfield, MO.', ""Affiliate Program Office, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Clinical Affairs Department, ASCO, Alexandria, VA.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, Cook Children's Medical Center, Fort Worth, TX."", ""Department of Hematology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,JCO Oncol Pract,JCO oncology practice,101758685,,IM,"['*Burnout, Professional', 'Child', 'Documentation', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Humans', 'Medical Oncology', 'Quality Improvement']",,,2020/08/08 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/08/08 06:00'],"['2020/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/OP.20.00294 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Oncol Pract. 2020 Nov;16(11):e1412-e1416. doi: 10.1200/OP.20.00294.

Supervised machine learning identified NRAS mutation and absence of mutations in ASXL2, RAD21, KIT and FLT3 genes as well as a low mutation to be associated with favorable outcome. Based on this data patients were classified into favorable and poor genetic risk classes. Patients classified as poor genetic risk had a significantly lower overall survival (OS) and relapse free survival (RFS). We could validate these findings independently on a validation cohort (n = 61). Patients in the poor genetic risk group were more likely to harbor measurable residual disease. Poor genetic risk emerged as an independent risk factor predictive of inferior outcome. Using an unbiased computational approach based we provide evidence for gene panel-based testing in AML with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and a framework for integration of genomic markers toward clinical decision making in this heterogeneous disease entity.","['Shaikh, Anam Fatima', 'Kakirde, Chinmayee', 'Dhamne, Chetan', 'Bhanshe, Prasanna', 'Joshi, Swapnali', 'Chaudhary, Shruti', 'Chatterjee, Gaurav',

A few studies have been devoted to the relationship between BTLA gene variations and cancer's risk. It has been essentially demonstrated to be involved in increasing cancer risk in chronic lymphocyte leukaemia, renal cell carcinoma, breast and colorectal cancer predispositions in Asian population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between BTLA gene polymorphisms and the risk of lung cancer in the Tunisian population. In a case-control study, three BTLA single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP): rs1982809 (A > G), rs9288952 (G > A) and rs9288953(C > T) were genotyped with the use of TaqMan probes in 169 lung cancer patients and in 300 controls. The rs1982809 SNP was significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer compared with controls in codominant and dominant models. The heterozygous rs1982809-AG genotype carriers had a higher risk of developing lung cancer when compared to AA genotype carriers in Tunisian population (OR (95%CI) = 1.63 (1.09-2.42), p = .01]. The AG genotype is an important risk factor associated with lymphatic invasion (OR = 3.71) and large-sized lung tumour (OR = 1.80). It is also a risk factor for the development of an adenocarcinoma subtype (OR = 2.08). However, the BTLA rs9288953 and rs9288952 SNPs were not associated with susceptibility for lung cancer (p > .05). Haplotype comparison did not show any significant association in our research. For the survival analysis, there was no impact of BTLA SNPs on the mortality risk associated to lung cancer in Tunisian patients. The current study is the first to demonstrate an association between BTLA rs1982809 polymorphism and an increased lung cancer risk in the Tunisian population.","['Khadhraoui, Chaima', 'Kaabachi, Wajih', 'Tritar, Fatma', 'Daghfous, Hafaoua', 'Hamzaoui, Kamel', 'Hamzaoui, Agnes']","['Khadhraoui C', 'Kaabachi W', 'Tritar F', 'Daghfous H', 'Hamzaoui K', 'Hamzaoui A']","['Medicine Faculty of Tunis, Tunis El Manar University, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Research Laboratory 19SP02 ""Chronic Pulmonary Pathologies: From Genome to Management, Abderrahman Mami Hospital, Ariana, Tunisia.', 'Medicine Faculty of Tunis, Tunis El Manar University, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Research Laboratory 19SP02 ""Chronic Pulmonary Pathologies: From Genome to Management, Abderrahman Mami Hospital, Ariana, Tunisia.', 'Medicine Faculty of Tunis, Tunis El Manar University, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Research Laboratory 19SP02 ""Chronic Pulmonary Pathologies: From Genome to Management, Abderrahman Mami Hospital, Ariana, Tunisia.', 'Department of Respiratory Diseases, Pavillon C, Hospital A.

We compared major HCT outcomes in 212 consecutive children transplanted at 11 centers in Brazil for acute leukemia or MDS from an HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD, n = 95), mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD, n = 47) or unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB, n = 70). Most had ALL (61%), bone marrow (57%) as the graft source and 95% received a MAC regimen. The 3-year OS probability were 57, 55, and 37% after HCT from MUD, MMUD, and UCB, respectively (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.07-2.63; P = .02). In comparison with MUD, OS was similar after transplantation of a >/= 6/8 HLA-matched or a high cell dose (>5 x 10(7) TNC/kg) CB unit (HR 1.41, 95%CI 0.88-2.27; P = .15). NRM was higher for UCB (HR 3.90, 95%CI 1.43-10.7; P = .01) but not for MMUD (HR 1.03, 95%CI 0.53-2.00; P > .20). Advanced disease (HR 2.05, 95%CI 1.26-3.33; P < .001) and UCB with high probability of being < 6/8 HLA-matched (HR 5.34, 95%CI 2.0-13.9; P < .001) were associated with higher mortality. Relapse and acute GVHD were similar among groups, while PGF was higher among UCB transplants (P = .002) and chronic GVHD among MMUD group (HR 2.88, 95% CI 1.05-7.88; P = .04). Our results suggest that in Brazil HCT outcomes performed with MMUD and MUD donors were comparable, while with UCB units < 6/8 HLA-matched were associated with higher NRM for children with acute leukemia or MDS.","['Tavares, Rita de Cassia Barbosa', 'Bonfim, Carmem Sales', 'Seber, Adriana', 'Pereira Lermontov, Simone', 'Coulturato, Vergilio', 'Zecchin, Victor Gottardello', 'Ribeiro, Lisandro', 'Fernandes, Juliana Folloni', 'Daudt, Liane Esteves', 'Grecco, Carlos S', 'Darrigo-Jr, Luiz Guilherme', 'Villela, Neysimelia', 'Nichele, Samantha', 'Gouveia, Roseane', 'Bouzas, Luis Fernando', 'Hamerschlak, Nelson', 'Vigorito, Afonso Celso', 'da Silva, Paula Moreira', 'da Silva, Priscila de Oliveira', 'da Silva, Cinthya Correa', 'de Souza Fernandez, Cecilia', 'Flowers, Mary Evelyn', 'Arcuri, Leonardo Javier']","['Tavares RCB', 'Bonfim CS', 'Seber A', 'Pereira Lermontov S', 'Coulturato V', 'Zecchin VG', 'Ribeiro L', 'Fernandes JF', 'Daudt LE', 'Grecco CS', 'Darrigo-Jr LG', 'Villela N', 'Nichele S', 'Gouveia R', 'Bouzas LF', 'Hamerschlak N', 'Vigorito AC', 'da Silva PM', 'da Silva PO', 'da Silva CC', 'de Souza Fernandez C', 'Flowers ME', 'Arcuri LJ']","['Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Hospital Samaritano Higienopolis, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Hospital Amaral Carvalho, Jau, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Oncologia pediatrica-GRAACC-Unifesp, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Instituto da Crianca - Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hospital das Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Hospital das Clinicas da, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Hospital das Clinicas da, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Cancer de Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Hospital Samaritano Higienopolis, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Universidade de Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hospital Amaral Carvalho, Jau, Brazil.', 'Hospital das Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal Fluminense, Niteroi, Brazil.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, USA.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,,IM,"['Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*MDS', '*allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*pediatric leukemia', '*umbilical cord blood', '*unrelated stem cell donor']",2020/08/07 06:00,2021/10/08 06:00,['2020/08/07 06:00'],"['2020/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13789 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2020 Nov;24(7):e13789. doi: 10.1111/petr.13789.

Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors can induce deeper and faster remission than imatinib, but are often associated with severe adverse events (AEs). The combination of pegylated interferon (IFN) with imatinib was shown to induce higher molecular remissions than imatinib alone in two studies. Treatment discontinuation rates due to IFN induced AEs were high in both studies. To investigate safety, tolerability (primary objective), and efficacy (secondary objective) of the combination of imatinib with ropeginterferon alpha-2b this phase I study was initiated. Twelve patients were planned to be enrolled. Nine patients completed the study according to protocol. Three patients terminated the study early, one due to occurrence of a dose-limiting toxicity (neutropenia grade 3), one due to an AE (panic attacks grade 2) and one due to the patient's decision. Tolerability was good, non-hematologic AEs were mainly grade 1/2, hematologic AEs were mainly neutropenias. No new AEs were reported for the combination of imatinib and ropeginterferon alpha-2b. In a nondose-dependent manner the addition of ropeginterferon alpha-2b led to the achievement of a DMR in four out of nine patients after a treatment duration of 18 months. The combination of imatinib and ropeginterferon alpha-2b is safe and showed in this phase I study the ability to deepen the molecular response in patients with chronic phase CML not achieving a DMR with imatinib alone.","['Heibl, Sonja', 'Buxhofer-Ausch, Veronika', 'Schmidt, Stefan', 'Webersinke, Gerald', 'Lion, Thomas', 'Piringer, Gudrun', 'Kuehr, Thomas', 'Wolf, Dominik', 'Melchardt, Thomas', 'Greil, Richard', 'Thaler, Josef']","['Heibl S', 'Buxhofer-Ausch V', 'Schmidt S', 'Webersinke G', 'Lion T', 'Piringer G', 'Kuehr T', 'Wolf D', 'Melchardt T', 'Greil R', 'Thaler J']","['Department of Internal Medicine IV, Klinikum Wels-Grieskirchen, Wels, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I with Hematology, Stem Cell Transplantation, Hemostaseology and Medical Oncology, Ordensklinikum Linz GmbH Elisabethinen, Linz, Austria.', 'Medical Faculty, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V (Hematology and Oncology), Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Labor fur Molekulargenetische Diagnostik, Ordensklinikum Linz GmbH Barmherzige Schwestern, Linz, Austria.', ""Labdia Labordiagnostik GmbH, Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Internal Medicine IV, Klinikum Wels-Grieskirchen, Wels, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine IV, Klinikum Wels-Grieskirchen, Wels, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V (Hematology and Oncology), Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Center for Clinical Cancer and Immunology Trials (SCRI-CCCIT), Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectiology and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Center for Clinical Cancer and Immunology Trials (SCRI-CCCIT), Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine IV, Klinikum Wels-Grieskirchen, Wels, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'G8RGG88B68 (peginterferon alfa-2b)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage', 'Interferon alpha-2/administration & dosage', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Retreatment', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'deep molecular remission', 'imatinib', 'ropeginterferon alpha-2b']",2020/08/07 06:00,2021/01/12 06:00,['2020/08/07 06:00'],"['2020/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2786 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2020 Dec;38(5):792-798. doi: 10.1002/hon.2786.

This rating was originally developed for clinicians to determine from medical charts. However, large studies are often unable to access medical charts for all study participants. We developed and tested a method of estimating treatment intensity (TI) using cancer registry and patient self-reported data. METHODS: We estimated two versions of TI for a cohort of pediatric cancer survivors-one utilized information solely available from cancer registry variables (TIR) and the other included registry and self-reported information (TIS) from survey participants. In a subset of cases (n = 135) for whom the gold standard TI (TIC) was known, both TIR and TIS were compared to TIC by calculating percent agreement and weighted Cohen's kappa, overall and within cancer subtypes. RESULTS: In comparison to TIC, 71% of TI scores from both methods were in agreement (k = 0.61 TIR/0.54 TIS). Among subgroups, agreement ranged from lowest (46% TIR/39% TIS) for non-defined tumors (e.g., ""Tumor-other""), to highest (94% TIR/94% TIS) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a methodology to estimate TI for pediatric cancer research when medical chart review is not possible. High reliability was observed for ALL, the most common pediatric cancer. Additional validation is needed among a larger sample of other cancer subgroups. The ability to estimate TI from cancer registry data would assist with monitoring effects of treatment during survivorship in registry-based epidemiological studies.","['Tobin, Jessica L', 'Thomas, Stefanie M', 'Freyer, David R', 'Hamilton, Ann S', 'Milam, Joel E']","['Tobin JL', 'Thomas SM', 'Freyer DR', 'Hamilton AS', 'Milam JE']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

This is a retrospective epidemiological study based on data obtained in the Brazilian Health Informatics Department (DATASUS), associated with the quantitative population. We created choropleth maps and predictive models of mortality rates, using the incidence rate ratio (IRR) to measure the size of the effect. Leukemia had a 1.76 higher mortality rate than lymphoma. Leukemia mortality trends increased by 1.2% per year between 2010 and 2016. Regions with the lowest social inequality had higher mortality rates for both diseases. There was a difference between peaks with higher chances of death due to leukemia (> 60 years) and lymphoma (> 70 years).

Palladium-catalyzed debenzylation reaction of benzyl ester intermediates was the key step in this synthetic procedure due to the simultaneous presence of a 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole ring in the molecule that was a competing coordination site for the palladium catalyst. High pressure (130 kPa) palladium-catalyzed procedure represented a successful synthetic step yielding the required products.

Younger patients will usually need repeat chemotherapy which has declining benefits and increasing toxicities with each course. Targeted therapies directed to the BRAF V600E mutation and Bruton's tyrosine kinase may be helpful, but rarely eradicate the minimal residual disease (MRD) which will eventually lead to relapse. Moxetumomab pasudotox (Moxe) is an anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin, which binds to CD22 on HCL cells and leads to apoptotic cell death after internalization and trafficking of the toxin to the cytosol. Phase I testing achieved a complete remission (CR) rate of 57% in relapsed/refractory HCL. Most CRs were without MRD and eradication of MRD correlated with prolonged CR duration. Patients were often MRD-free after five years. Important mild-moderate toxicities included capillary leak and hemolytic uremic syndromes which could be prevented and managed conservatively. A phase 3 trial met its endpoint of durable CR with acceptable toxicity, leading to FDA approval of Moxe for relapsed/refractory HCL, under the name Lumoxiti.

To date, the nature and cellular composition of the BM tumor microenvironment and the critical factors which drive tumor progression remain imprecisely defined. Our studies show that Gremlin1 (Grem1), a highly conserved protein, which is abundantly secreted by a subset of BM mesenchymal stromal cells, plays a critical role in MM disease development. Analysis of human and mouse BM stromal samples by quantitative PCR showed that GREM1/Grem1 expression was significantly higher in the MM tumor-bearing cohorts compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Additionally, BM-stromal cells cultured with 5TGM1 MM PC line expressed significantly higher levels of Grem1, compared to stromal cells alone (p < 0.01, t-test), suggesting that MM PCs promote increased Grem1 expression in stromal cells. Furthermore, the proliferation of 5TGM1 MM PCs was found to be significantly increased when co-cultured with Grem1-overexpressing stromal cells (p < 0.01, t-test). To examine the role of Grem1 in MM disease in vivo, we utilized the 5TGM1/KaLwRij mouse model of MM. Our studies showed that, compared to immunoglobulin G (IgG) control antibody-treated mice, mice treated with an anti-Grem1 neutralizing antibody had a decrease in MM tumor burden of up to 81.2% (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA). The studies presented here demonstrate, for the first time, a novel positive feedback loop between MM PCs and BM stroma, and that inhibiting this vicious cycle with a neutralizing antibody can dramatically reduce tumor burden in a preclinical mouse model of MM.","['Clark, Kimberley C', 'Hewett, Duncan R', 'Panagopoulos, Vasilios', 'Plakhova, Natalya', 'Opperman, Khatora S', 'Bradey, Alanah L', 'Mrozik, Krzysztof M', 'Vandyke, Kate', 'Mukherjee, Siddhartha', 'Davies, Gareth C G', 'Worthley, Daniel L', 'Zannettino, Andrew C W']","['Clark KC', 'Hewett DR', 'Panagopoulos V', 'Plakhova N', 'Opperman KS', 'Bradey AL', 'Mrozik KM', 'Vandyke K', 'Mukherjee S', 'Davies GCG', 'Worthley DL', 'Zannettino ACW']","['Myeloma Research Laboratory, Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Myeloma Research Laboratory, Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Myeloma Research Laboratory, Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Myeloma Research Laboratory, Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Myeloma Research Laboratory, Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Myeloma Research Laboratory, Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Myeloma Research Laboratory, Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Myeloma Research Laboratory, Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York City, NY 10032, USA.', 'UCB (Union Chimique Belge) Pharma, Slough SL1 3WE, UK.', 'Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Myeloma Research Laboratory, Adelaide Medical School, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.', 'Central Adelaide Local Health Network, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Grem1', 'Gremlin1', 'bone marrow stromal cells', 'multiple myeloma']",2020/08/07 06:00,2020/08/07 06:01,['2020/08/07 06:00'],"['2020/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/07 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12082149 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12082149 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Aug 3;12(8). pii: cancers12082149. doi: 10.3390/cancers12082149.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6010-1116', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0678-8276', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1033-849X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5180-3143']",20200803,,,"['654718/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society', 'APP1104031/National Health and Medical Research Council']",PMC7464474,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here the resistance to ATRA treatment of T24 cell line, bladder cancer, was investigated. T24 was not only resistant to cell death when treated at concentrations up to 20 microM of ATRA, but it was also able to stimulate the cellular proliferation. An over-expression of the fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) in conjunction with the cellular retinol-binding protein-II (CRABP-II) down-expression was found. However, the direct inhibition of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARbeta/delta) did not abolish T24 proliferation, but rather potentiated it. Moreover, considering the ability of the long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) to displace ATRA from FABP5, the actions of the saturated palmitic acid (PA), unsaturated omega-6 linoleic acid (LA) and omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were evaluated to counteract ATRA-related proliferation. ATRA-PA co-treatment induces cellular growth inhibition, while ATRA-LA co-treatment induces cellular growth enhancement. However, even if DHA is unsaturated LCFA as LA, it was able to reverse the ATRA-induced cellular proliferation of T24, bringing the viability percentages at the levels of the control.","['Costantini, Lara', 'Molinari, Romina', 'Farinon, Barbara', 'Lelli, Veronica', 'Timperio, Anna Maria', 'Merendino, Nicolo']","['Costantini L', 'Molinari R', 'Farinon B', 'Lelli V', 'Timperio AM', 'Merendino N']","[""Department of Ecological and Biological Sciences (DEB), Tuscia University, Largo dell'Universita snc, 01100 Viterbo, Italy."", ""Department of Ecological and Biological Sciences (DEB), Tuscia University, Largo dell'Universita snc, 01100 Viterbo, Italy."", ""Department of Ecological and Biological Sciences (DEB), Tuscia University, Largo dell'Universita snc, 01100 Viterbo, Italy."", ""Department of Ecological and Biological Sciences (DEB), Tuscia University, Largo dell'Universita snc, 01100 Viterbo, Italy."", ""Department of Ecological and Biological Sciences (DEB), Tuscia University, Largo dell'Universita snc, 01100 Viterbo, Italy."", ""Department of Ecological and Biological Sciences (DEB), Tuscia University, Largo dell'Universita snc, 01100 Viterbo, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['T24 bladder cancer cell line', 'all-trans retinoic acid', 'cellular proliferation', 'docosahexaenoic acid', 'linoleic acid', 'palmitic acid']",2020/08/07 06:00,2020/08/07 06:01,['2020/08/07 06:00'],"['2020/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/07 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9082494 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9082494 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Aug 3;9(8). pii: jcm9082494. doi: 10.3390/jcm9082494.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9147-9755', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4164-6564', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9512-393X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8457-042X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5044-1398']",20200803,,,,PMC7465316,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphoma/leukemia related factor (LRF) is encoded by ZBTB7A gene and belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of transcription factors, implicated in vital cellular functions. The present data, demonstrating the wide-spread and the high overlap of the LRF/ZBTB7A recognition sites with genomic segments identified as CpG islands in the human genome, suggest that its binding capacity strongly depends on a specific sequence-encoded feature within CpGs. We have previously shown that de-methylation of the CpG island 326 lying in the ZBTB7A gene promoter is associated with impaired pharmacological induction of fetal hemoglobin in beta-type hemoglobinopathies patients. Within this context we aimed to investigate the extent of the LRF/ZBTB7A conservation among primates and mouse genome, focusing our interest also on the CpG island flanking the gene's promoter region, in an effort to further establish its epigenetic regulatory role in human hematopoiesis and pharmacological involvement in hematopoietic disorders. Comparative analysis of the human ZBTB7A nucleotide and amino acid sequences and orthologous sequences among non-human primates and mouse, exhibited high conservation scores. Pathway analysis, clearly indicated that LRF/ZBTB7A influences conserved cellular processes. These data in conjunction with the high levels of expression foremost in hematopoietic tissues, highlighted LRF/ZBTB7A as an essential factor operating indisputably during hematopoiesis.","['Chondrou, Vasiliki', 'Markopoulos, Georgios S', 'Patrinos, George P', 'Kouraklis-Symeonidis, Alexandra', 'Symeonidis, Argiris', 'Papachatzopoulou, Adamantia', 'Sgourou, Argyro']","['Chondrou V', 'Markopoulos GS', 'Patrinos GP', 'Kouraklis-Symeonidis A', 'Symeonidis A', 'Papachatzopoulou A', 'Sgourou A']","['Hellenic Open University, School of Science and Technology, Biology Laboratory, Patras, Greece.', 'University of Ioannina, Faculty of Medicine, Biology Laboratory, Ioannina, Greece.', 'University of Patras, School of Health Sciences, Department of Pharmacy, Laboratory of Pharmacogenomics and Individualized Therapy, Patras, Greece; United Arab Emirates University, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Pathology, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates.', 'General University Hospital of Patras, Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathies Unit, Hematology Division Department of Internal Medicine, Patras, Greece.', 'University of Patras, Medical School, Hematology Division, Dept of Internal Medicine, Patras, Greece.', 'University of Patras, Medical Faculty, Laboratory of General Biology, Patras, Greece.', 'Hellenic Open University, School of Science and Technology, Biology Laboratory, Patras, Greece.

We infused 7 patients with refractory or multiply relapsed B-ALL who presented with isolated EM relapse with tisagenlecleucel. Six patients had isolated central nervous system (CNS) leukemia, and 1 patient had an isolated testicular relapse. An initial complete response was seen in all patients, with 5 patients remaining in CAR-T-induced remission at a median of 18 months from first infusion. Reversible ICANS was seen in 1 patient with CNS leukemia. Durable B cell aplasia occurred in 3 patients, with a median time to B cell recovery of 6.5 months in the other patients.

We aimed to determine the prevalence and prognostic impact of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutation, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and flow marker's expression in patients with APL. METHODS: In the present study, 165 de novo APL patients were molecularly characterized for promyelocytic leukemia (PML) breakpoint and additional genetic alterations. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR assays were used to detect genetic alterations. RESULTS: PML/RARalpha was detected in 29/165 (17.5%) samples with breakpoint cluster region 1 (bcr1) in 17/29 (58.5%) and bcr3 in 12/29 (41.5%) samples. The prevalence of FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and EGFR were detected in 5/29 (17.5%), 11/29 (38%), and 5/29 (17.5%) patients, respectively. Patients expressing bcr-3 hybrid transcript had lower overall survival compared with bcr1 (p = .254). White blood cell (WBC) count was significantly higher in bcr3 in comparison with bcr1 patients (p = .002). Patients with positive EGFR expression (p = .042) and higher WBC (p = .002) were significantly associated with poor survival (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: We documented the higher prevalence of bcr1 and confirmed that the association of FLT3-ITD significantly reduced the chances of survival in APL. The mortality rate of bcr3 was comparatively higher than that of bcr1. Higher WBC count and EGFR expression were significantly associated with poor survival.","['Nath, Sukanta', 'Bhattacharyya, Jina', 'Chandra, Prem', 'Saxena, Renu', 'Sazawal, Sudha', 'Saikia, Kandarpa Kumar']","['Nath S', 'Bhattacharyya J', 'Chandra P', 'Saxena R', 'Sazawal S', 'Saikia KK']","['Department of Bioengineering and Technology, Gauhati University, Guwahati, Assam, India.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, Guwahati, Assam, India.', 'Medical Research Centre, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Haematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Haematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Bioengineering and Technology, Gauhati University, Guwahati, Assam, India.

Treatment of these malignancies has undergone recent transformation with the development of new gene therapy and molecular biology techniques, which are safer and well-tolerated therapeutic approaches. The CD19 antigen is the most studied therapeutic target in these hematological cancers. This study reports the results of clinical-grade production, quality control, and in vivo efficacy processes of ISIKOK-19 cells as the first academic clinical trial of CAR-T cells targeting CD19-expressing B cells in relapsed/refractory ALL and NHL patients in Turkey. Materials and Methods: We used a lentiviral vector encoding the CD19 antigen-specific antibody head (FMC63) conjugated with the CD8-CD28-CD3zeta sequence as a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) along with a truncated form of EGFR (EGFRt) on human T-lymphocytes (CAR-T). We preclinically assessed the efficacy and safety of the manufactured CAR-T cells, namely ISIKOK-19, from both healthy donors' and ALL/NHL patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Results: We showed significant enhancement of CAR lentivirus transduction efficacy in T-cells using BX-795, an inhibitor of the signaling molecule TBK1/IKKE, in order to cut the cost of CAR-T cell production. In addition, ISIKOK-19 cells demonstrated a significantly high level of cytotoxicity specifically against a CD19+ B-lymphocyte cancer model, RAJI cells, in NOD/SCID mice. Conclusion: This is the first report of preclinical assessment of efficacy and safety analysis of CAR-T cells (ISIKOK-19) targeting CD19-expressing B cells in relapsed/refractory ALL and NHL patients in Turkey.","['Tastan, Cihan', 'Kancagi, Derya Dilek', 'Turan, Raife Dilek', 'Yurtsever, Bulut', 'Cakirsoy, Didem', 'Abanuz, Selen', 'Yilanci, Muhammet', 'Seyis, Utku', 'Ozer, Samed', 'Mert, Selin', 'Kayhan, Cavit Kerem', 'Tokat, Fatma', 'Acikel Elmas, Merve', 'Birdogan, Selcuk', 'Arbak, Serap', 'Yalcin, Koray', 'Sezgin, Aslihan', 'Kizilkilic, Ebru', 'Hemsinlioglu, Cansu', 'Ince, Umit', 'Ratip, Siret', 'Ovali, Ercument']","['Tastan C', 'Kancagi DD', 'Turan RD', 'Yurtsever B', 'Cakirsoy D', 'Abanuz S', 'Yilanci M', 'Seyis U', 'Ozer S', 'Mert S', 'Kayhan CK', 'Tokat F', 'Acikel Elmas M', 'Birdogan S', 'Arbak S', 'Yalcin K', 'Sezgin A', 'Kizilkilic E', 'Hemsinlioglu C', 'Ince U', 'Ratip S', 'Ovali E']","['Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Animal Application and Research Center, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Bogazici University, Center of Life Sciences and Technologies, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Maslak Hospital, Pathology Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Histology and Embryology, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University, Electron Microscopy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Histology and Embryology, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Medical Park Goztepe Hospital, Pediatric Hematopoetic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Altunizade Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Altunizade Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Istanbul, Turkey', 'Acibadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory, Istanbul, Turkey']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/etiology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR-T', '*CD19', '*Chimeric antigen receptor', '*Immunotherapy']",2020/08/06 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.galenos.2020.2020.0070 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2020 Nov 19;37(4):234-247. doi: 10.4274/tjh.galenos.2020.2020.0070.

Chromatin accessibility maps of seven developmental stages of human healthy T cells revealed progressive chromatin condensation during T-cell maturation. Developmental stages were distinguished by 2,823 signature chromatin regions with 95% accuracy. Open chromatin surrounding SAE1 was identified to best distinguish thymic developmental stages suggesting a potential role of SUMOylation in T-cell development. Deconvolution using signature regions revealed that T-ALLs, including those with mature immunophenotypes, resemble the most immature populations, which was confirmed by TF-binding motif profiles. We integrated ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq and found DAB1, a gene not related to leukemia previously, to be overexpressed, abnormally spliced and hyper-accessible in T-ALLs. DAB1-negative patients formed a distinct subgroup with particularly immature chromatin profiles and hyper-accessible binding sites for SPI1 (PU.1), a TF crucial for normal T-cell maturation. In conclusion, our analyses of chromatin accessibility and TF-binding motifs showed that pediatric T-ALL cells are most similar to immature thymic precursors, indicating an early developmental arrest.","['Erarslan-Uysal, Busra', 'Kunz, Joachim B', 'Rausch, Tobias', 'Richter-Pechanska, Paulina', 'van Belzen, Ianthe Aem', 'Frismantas, Viktoras', 'Bornhauser, Beat', 'Ordonez-Rueada, Diana',

MALAT1 level has been shown to be upregulated in relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, but the mechanism is unclear. This study aims to investigate the functional roles and underlying mechanisms of MALAT1 in ALL. MALAT1 and miR-205 expression were assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). MTT assay and flow cytometry were performed to evaluate cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. Protein level of protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7) was detected by Western blot assay. Dual luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm the binding of MALAT1 and miR-205, as well as miR-205 and PTK7. The levels of MALAT1 and PTK7 were upregulated in ALL samples. In contrast, miR-205 level was downregulated in ALL in ALL samples. Moreover, MALAT1 silencing or miR-205 overexpression restrained proliferation and promoted apoptosis of ALL cells. Mechanistically, MALAT1 sponged miR-205 to regulate PTK7 expression. In summary, MALAT1 affected ALL cell proliferation and apoptosis via regulating miR-205-PTK7 axis.

Chemotherapy helps reduce AML bulk, but promotes relapse in the long-run by selection of chemoresistant leukemia stem cells (LSC). These may diversify and result in progression to more aggressive forms of AML. In vivo models suggest that the bone marrow stem cell niche helps LSC stay dormant and protected from chemotherapy. Here, we summarize relevant changes in stem cell niche homing and adhesion of AML LSC vs. healthy hematopoietic stem cells, and provide an overview of clinical trials aiming at targeting these processes for AML treatment and future directions within this field. Promising results with various non-mutation-targeted novel therapies directed to LSC eradication via interference with their anchoring to the stem cell niche have encouraged on-going or future advanced phase III clinical trials. In the coming years, we may see a shift in the focus of AML treatment to LSC-directed therapies if the prospect of improved cure rates holds true. In the future, AML treatment should lean toward personalized therapies using combinations of these compounds plus mutation-targeted agents and/or targeted delivery of chemotherapy, aiming at LSC eradication with reduced side effects.","['Villatoro, Alicia', 'Konieczny, Joanna', 'Cuminetti, Vincent', 'Arranz, Lorena']","['Villatoro A', 'Konieczny J', 'Cuminetti V', 'Arranz L']","['Stem Cell Aging and Cancer Research Group, Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, UiT - The Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway.', 'Stem Cell Aging and Cancer Research Group, Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, UiT - The Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway.', 'Stem Cell Aging and Cancer Research Group, Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, UiT - The Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway.', 'Stem Cell Aging and Cancer Research Group, Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Health Sciences, UiT - The Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway.', 'Norwegian Center for Molecular Medicine (NCMM), University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'adhesion', 'clinical trials', 'hematopoietic stem cell', 'hematopoietic stem cell niche', 'homing', 'leukemia stem cell', 'mobilization']",2020/08/06 06:00,2020/08/06 06:01,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2020.00607 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2020 Jul 9;8:607. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2020.00607. eCollection 2020.,,20200709,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Villatoro, Konieczny, Cuminetti and Arranz.']",,PMC7367216,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis of their clinical significance is difficult because of the multitude of translocation fusion partners and their low frequency. The presence of t(10;11)(p12;q23) translocation was previously identified in pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). It is considered as the second most common translocation detected in pediatric 11q23/MLL-rearranged (present KMT2A) AML, after t(9;11)(p22;q23). The presence of the above translocation was previously identified as an unfavorable prognostic factor. Since June 2015, the Polish Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group has applied the therapeutic protocol requiring extensive diagnostics of genetic changes in pediatric AML. Until November 2019, molecular genetic studies were performed in 195 children with diagnosed AML to identify carriers of fusion gene transcripts for 28 most common chromosomal translocations in acute leukemia. The fusion gene transcript for translocation t(10;11)(p12;q23) involving MLL gene was detected with unexpectedly high frequency (8.9%) in our research. It was the highest frequency of all detected MLL rearrangements, as well as other detected fusion gene transcripts from chromosomal aberrations characteristic for AML. It seems that chromosomal aberration between chromosomes 10 and 11 can be relatively frequent in some populations. Paying attention to this fact and ensuring proper genetic diagnosis seem to be important for appropriate allocation of patients to risk groups of pediatric AML treatment protocols.","['Ksiazek,

Approximately 10% of the neonates with DS show a unique disorder known as transient leukemia or transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM). Their clinical and morphological features are indistinguishable from acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, they regress spontaneously within the first few months of life. Here we present a series of four cases with different hematological conditions in children with DS. Of the four cases, two presented with AML-M7, one with TAM, and one case was diagnosed as AML-M2 subtype. This case series highlights the spectrum of hematological disorders in children with DS.

This inter-regional variation may be due to geographic, cultural or racial variation or maybe due deficiency in case of notification, especially in rural areas. Objective: The aim of our study is to determine the prevalence of different types of hematological malignancies with the ABO blood group at a teaching hospital in Varanasi, India. This cross-sectional study of 77 cases was conducted during 2016-2017 at a tertiary care center. We analyzed the age, sex, subtype of leukemia, blood group, clinical features, and laboratory parameters of patients. Age ranged between 1 year and 81 years with a male to female ratio of 1.9:1. A total of 66.3% of patients were suffering from acute leukemia and 33.7% from chronic leukemia. The most common blood group was B positive (44.8%) but no significant association was found (P = 0.822). Fever (76.6%) and generalized weakness/easy fatigability (46.75%) were common complaints, whereas pallor (68.8%) and splenomegaly (51.9%) were common signs. Cases were from 23 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh and western Bihar. The majority of the cases (70.12%) were from 8 districts (Jaunpur, Varanasi, Azamgarh, Ballia, Bhadhoi, Gazipur, Kaimur, Rohtas) of Uttar Pradesh, India and Aurangabad district of Bihar. Acute leukemia is more prevalent than chronic leukemia with more male preponderance. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were commonly found in children, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was found in both children and adults. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) mainly noted in adults. Unclassified acute leukemia was seen mainly in children and young adults. Anemia was more severe in acute conditions and thrombocytopenia was also more in acute leukemia.

Despite this, they had still to go to hospital to receive chemotherapy during lockdown. In this context, we have evaluated the psychological status of onco-hematological outpatients receiving infusion and not deferrable anti-neoplastic treatment for lymphoproliferative neoplasms, with the aim of both measuring the levels of post-traumatic symptoms, depression, and anxiety during the pandemic and also of investigating the perception of risk of potential nosocomial infection. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were administered to all patients. Moreover, patients were investigated about their worries regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their lives as onco-hematologic patients. Since the 2nd to the 29th April 2020 (during the first phase of the lockdown period in Italy), 77 outpatients were prospectively evaluated. They were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/Small lymphocytic lymphoma. The mean age was 56.6 (range 22-85).

We present a case of severe immune-mediated liver injury by nilotinib treatment. Case report: A 59-year-old woman was referred to the liver clinic because of elevated liver enzyme levels. One year prior, she was diagnosed as having chronic myeloid leukemia and treated with nilotinib therapy. The level of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were 578 IU/L and 499 IU/L, respectively. Percutaneous needle liver biopsy showed extensive centrilobular infiltration of immune cells and destruction of the lobular architecture with minimal inflammation in the portal triad. Immunohistochemical staining showed that many CD8(+) T cells and CD56(+) cells infiltrated the site of inflammation. Multicolor fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis revealed that a considerable number of intrahepatic CD8+ T cells showed an activated phenotype compared with the healthy control. She was diagnosed with nilotinib-induced, immune-mediated liver injury. Prednisolone treatment (30 mg daily) was started and caused rapid normalization of liver enzyme levels. Conclusion: Nilotinib can cause immune-mediated liver injury. The use of corticosteroid can be treatment option in immune-mediated liver injury.","['Yang, Hyun', 'Sung, Pil Soo', 'Jung, Eun Sun', 'Cho, Sungwoo', 'Bae, Si Hyun', 'Kim, Dong-Wook']","['Yang H', 'Sung PS', 'Jung ES', 'Cho S', 'Bae SH', 'Kim DW']","[""Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea."", ""Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea."", 'The Catholic University Liver Research Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', ""Department of Hospital Pathology, College of Medicine, Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea."", 'The Catholic University Liver Research Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', ""Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea."", 'The Catholic University Liver Research Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', ""Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.""]",['eng'],['Case Reports'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'corticosteroid', 'drug induced liver injury', 'hepatotoxicity', 'nilotinib']",2020/08/06 06:00,2020/08/06 06:01,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.01160 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jul 10;10:1160. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01160. eCollection 2020.,,20200710,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Yang, Sung, Jung, Cho, Bae and Kim.']",,PMC7367179,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyse the clinicopathological profile and outcome of CMMS from a large tertiary-care pediatric oncology center in Pakistan. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical record of a tertiary-care hospital in Pakistan from April 2017 to September 2019 for all children (1 month-16 years) who presented with an anterior mediastinal mass (AMM). A CMMS case is defined as a child with an AMM presenting with cardiorespiratory compromise and needing intensive care support. Demographic data, clinical profile, pathological diagnosis, and outcome of all such children were recorded. Descriptive statistics were applied using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results Of the total 221 mediastinal masses, 61 children were diagnosed as CMMS and enrolled in the study. The mean age was 9 +/- 3.3 years, and 68.9%% were male; 65.6% of patients had a weight for age less than the fifth percentile. A total of 49.2% of patients had a duration of illness of more than one month before diagnosis. Fever (97.6%) and lymphadenopathy (82%) were the most common findings, along with respiratory and cardiovascular signs and symptoms; 9.8% had superior vena cava syndrome. The pericardial effusion was present in 54.6% and 27.9% had pleural effusion. Peripheral blood flow cytometry made the diagnosis in 59%, peripheral lymph node biopsy in 13%, mediastinal core biopsy in 5%, and pleural fluid flow cytometry in one case; 62.3% had a white blood cell count of >100,000/mm(3). A total of 72.1% (n=44) cases were diagnosed as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in our cohort. Clinical and laboratory tumor lysis syndrome developed in 10% and 73% of cases, respectively. Mechanical ventilation was required in 9.8% of the cohort. Mortality was reported in 10 (16.4%) patients. Conclusion We found that the 100% fatality rate with controlled positive pressure ventilation and spontaneous breathing is ideal. Tumour lysis syndrome was the most common morbidity in our cohort.","['Nasir, Saad', 'Jabbar, Rafia', 'Rehman, Faiza', 'Khalid, Muhammad', 'Khan, Muhammad Rahil', 'Haque, Anwar']","['Nasir S', 'Jabbar R', 'Rehman F', 'Khalid M', 'Khan MR', 'Haque A']","['Internal Medicine, United Medical and Dental College, Creek General Hospital, Karachi, PAK.', 'Pediatrics, The Indus Hospital, Karachi, PAK.', 'Pediatrics, The Indus Hospital, Karachi, PAK.', ""Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital & The Institute of Child Health, Multan, PAK."", 'Pediatrics, The Indus Hospital, Karachi, PAK.', 'Pediatrics, The Indus Hospital, Karachi, PAK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'anterior mediastinal mass', 'critical', 'pediatric cancers']",2020/08/06 06:00,2020/08/06 06:01,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.8838 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 Jun 26;12(6):e8838. doi: 10.7759/cureus.8838.,,20200626,,"['Copyright (c) 2020, Nasir et al.']",,PMC7386080,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Midostaurin was the first FLT3 inhibitor FDA approved for AML and is standard of care for FLT3 mutant patients undergoing induction chemotherapy [1, 2]. As there is a spectrum of response, we hypothesized that biological factors beyond FLT3 could play a role in drug sensitivity and that select FLT3-ITD negative samples may also demonstrate sensitivity. Thus, we aimed to identify features that would predict response to midostaurin in FLT3 mutant and wild-type samples. We performed an ex vivo drug sensitivity screen on primary and relapsed AML samples with corresponding targeted sequencing and RNA sequencing. We observed a correlation between FLT3-ITD mutations and midostaurin sensitivity as expected and observed KRAS and TP53 mutations correlating with midostaurin resistance in FLT3-ITD negative samples. Further, we identified genes differentially expressed in sensitive vs. resistant samples independent of FLT3-ITD status. Within FLT3-ITD mutant samples, over-expression of RGL4, oncogene and regulator of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade, distinguished resistant from sensitive samples. Overall, this study highlights the complexity underlying midostaurin response. And, our results suggest that therapies that target both FLT3 and MAPK/ERK signaling may help circumvent some cases of resistance.","['Rosenberg, Mara W', 'Watanabe-Smith, Kevin', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Tognon, Cristina E', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Borate, Uma']","['Rosenberg MW', 'Watanabe-Smith K', 'Tyner JW', 'Tognon CE', 'Druker BJ', 'Borate U']","['Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental, and Cancer Biology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'drug sensitivity', 'midostaurin']",2020/08/06 06:00,2020/08/06 06:01,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27656 [doi]', '27656 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2020 Jul 21;11(29):2807-2818. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27656. eCollection 2020 Jul 21.,,20200721,,['Copyright: (c) 2020 Rosenberg et al.'],"['K99 CA245896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA214428/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA217862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA224019/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7381100,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST B.J.D. potential competing interests; SAB: Aileron', 'Therapeutics, Therapy Architects (ALLCRON), Cepheid, Vivid Biosciences, Celgene,', 'RUNX1 Research Program, EnLiven Therapeutics, Gilead Sciences (inactive), Monojul', '(inactive); SAB & Stock: Aptose Biosciences, Blueprint Medicines, Iterion', 'Therapeutics, Third Coast Therapeutics, GRAIL (SAB inactive); Scientific Founder:', 'MolecularMD (inactive, acquired by ICON); Board of Directors & Stock: Amgen;', 'Board of Directors: Burroughs Wellcome Fund, CureOne; Joint Steering Committee:', 'Beat AML LLS; Founder: VB Therapeutics; Clinical Trial Funding: Novartis,', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer; Royalties from Patent 6958335 (Novartis exclusive', 'license) and OHSU and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (one Merck exclusive license).', 'C.E.T. potential competing interests; SRA Ignyta Pharmaceuticals (inactive).']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: CXCR4 expression on ALL cells from newly diagnosed or R/R ALL patients were detected using flow cytometry. The CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling pathway was blocked by the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 in a co-culture model of primary drug-resistant ALL cells and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs). Surface CXCR4 expression, apoptosis rate, and apoptosis-related protein expression in primary ALL cells under various treatments were detected. Results: Of the 37 ALL patients examined, CXCR4 expression was higher in R/R patients than that in those with newly diagnosed disease. Similarly, in in vitro co-cultures of drug-resistant ALL cells with UCMSCs, the expression of CXCR4 was increased in the presence of vincristine (VCR), but reduced when VCR was combined with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. Additionally, the supernatants of ALL-UCMSC co-cultures contained high CXCL12 concentrations, which were upregulated by VCR and significantly decreased by the combination of VCR plus AMD3100. Furthermore, the apoptosis rate of ALL cells significantly decreased, Bax expression was downregulated, and Bcl-2 was upregulated when ALL was co-cultured with UCMSCs compared with ALL cells alone. With the addition of VCR, the apoptosis rate mildly increased, Bax was upregulated, and Bcl-2 was downregulated. Nevertheless, the above results were further intensified, particularly Bax expression, when VCR was combined with AMD3100. Conclusion: The CXCR4 antagonist could effectively reverse MSC-mediated drug resistance by blocking the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis and sensitizing leukemic cells from R/R ALL patients to chemotherapy drugs.","['Wang, Shan', 'Wang, Xiaojiao', 'Liu, Sha', 'Zhang, Shengnan', 'Wei, Xudong', 'Song, Yongping', 'Yin, Qingsong']","['Wang S', 'Wang X', 'Liu S', 'Zhang S', 'Wei X', 'Song Y', 'Yin Q']","[""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Henan Cancer Hospital), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Henan Cancer Hospital), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Henan Cancer Hospital), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Henan Cancer Hospital), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Henan Cancer Hospital), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Henan Cancer Hospital), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University (Henan Cancer Hospital), Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'bone marrow microenvironment', 'drug resistance', 'relapsed/refractory']",2020/08/06 06:00,2020/08/06 06:01,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S249425 [doi]', '249425 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2020 Jul 6;13:6583-6591. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S249425. eCollection 2020.,,20200706,,['(c) 2020 Wang et al.'],,PMC7352451,,,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the relative role of PKCbetaII in B cells by generating transgenic mice where expression of the transgene is directed to these cells using the Emicro promoter (Emicro-PKCbetaIItg). Our findings demonstrate that homozygous Emicro-PKCbetaIItg mice displayed a shift from IgD(+)IgM(dim) toward IgD(dim)IgM(+) B cell populations in spleen, peritoneum and peripheral blood. Closer examination of these tissues revealed respective expansion of marginal zone (MZ)-like B cells (IgD(+)IgM(+)CD43(neg)CD21(+)CD24(+)), increased populations of B-1 cells (B220(+)IgD(dim)IgM(+)CD43(+)CD24(+)CD5(+)), and higher numbers of immature B cells (IgD(dim)IgM(dim)CD21(neg)) at the expense of mature B cells (IgD(+)IgM(+)CD21(+)). Therefore, the overexpression of PKCbetaII, which is a phenotypic feature of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells, can skew B cell development in mice, most likely as a result of a regulatory influence on BCR signaling.","['Azar, Ali A', 'Michie, Alison M', 'Tarafdar, Anuradha', 'Malik, Natasha', 'Menon, Geetha K', 'Till, Kathleen J', 'Vlatkovic, Nikolina', 'Slupsky, Joseph R']","['Azar AA', 'Michie AM', 'Tarafdar A', 'Malik N', 'Menon GK', 'Till KJ', 'Vlatkovic N', 'Slupsky JR']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, 1st Floor Sherrington Building, Ashton Street, Liverpool, L69 3GE, UK.', 'Barts Cancer Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Molecular Lymphopoiesis Group, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Molecular Lymphopoiesis Group, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Molecular Lymphopoiesis Group, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.', 'Department of Histopathology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, 1st Floor Sherrington Building, Ashton Street, Liverpool, L69 3GE, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, 1st Floor Sherrington Building, Ashton Street, Liverpool, L69 3GE, UK. vlatko@liverpool.ac.uk.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, 1st Floor Sherrington Building, Ashton Street, Liverpool, L69 3GE, UK. jslupsky@liverpool.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Prkcb protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*enzymology/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Immunoglobulin D/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Protein Kinase C beta/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2020/08/06 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-70191-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-70191-y [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Aug 4;10(1):13156. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-70191-y.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5404-475X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1768-3544', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7410-9004']",20200804,,,,PMC7403146,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A study of the ALL SCT 2003 BFM-SG and 2007-BFM-International SG.,257-266,10.1038/s41409-020-01014-x [doi],"Allogeneic HSCT represents the only potentially curative treatment for very high risk (VHR) ALL. Two consecutive international prospective studies, ALL-SCT-(I)BFM 2003 and 2007 were conducted in 1150 pediatric patients. 569 presented with VHR disease leading to any kind of HSCT. All patients >2 year old were transplanted after TBI-based MAC. The median follow-up was 5 years. 463 patients were transplanted from matched donor (MD) and 106 from mismatched donor (MMD). 214 were in CR1. Stem cell source was unmanipulated BM for 330 patients, unmanipulated PBSC for 135, ex vivo T-cell depleted PBSC for 62 and cord-blood for 26. There were more advanced disease, more ex vivo T-cell depletion, and more chemotherapy based conditioning regimen for patients transplanted from MMD as compared to those transplanted from MSD or MD. Median follow up (reversed Kaplan Meier estimator) was 4.99 years, median follow up of survivals was 4.88, range (0.01-11.72) years. The 4-year CI of extensive cGvHD was 13 +/- 2% and 17 +/- 4% (p = NS) for the patients transplanted from MD and MMD, respectively. 4-year EFS was statistically better for patients transplanted from MD (60 +/- 2% vs. 42 +/- 5%, p < 0.001) for the whole cohort. This difference does not exist if considering separately patients treated in the most recent study. There was no difference in 4-year CI of relapse. The 4-year NRM was lower for patients transplanted from MD (9 +/- 1% vs. 23 +/- 4%, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, donor-type appears as a negative risk-factor for OS, EFS, and NRM. This paper demonstrates the impact of donor type on overall results of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for very-high risk pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia with worse results when using MMD stem cell source.","['Dalle, Jean-Hugues', 'Balduzzi, Adriana', 'Bader, Peter', 'Pieczonka, Anna', 'Yaniv, Isaac', 'Lankester, Arjan', 'Bierings, Marc', 'Yesilipek, Akif', 'Sedlacek, Petr', 'Ifversen, Marianne', 'Svec, Peter', 'Toporski, Jacek', 'Gungor, Taifun', 'Wachowiak, Jacek', 'Glogova, Evgenia', 'Poetschger, Ulrike', 'Peters, Christina']","['Dalle JH', 'Balduzzi A', 'Bader P', 'Pieczonka A', 'Yaniv I', 'Lankester A', 'Bierings M', 'Yesilipek A', 'Sedlacek P', 'Ifversen M', 'Svec P', 'Toporski J', 'Gungor T', 'Wachowiak J', 'Glogova E', 'Poetschger U', 'Peters C']","['Department of Pediatric Hemato-Immunology, Hopital Robert Debre, APHP Nord-Universite de Paris, Paris, France. jean-hugues.dalle@aphp.fr.', 'Clinica Pediatrica, Universita degli Studi di Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM/Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Department for Children and Adolescents, University Hospital Frankfurt, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Depratment of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and HSCT, Poznan, Poland.', ""The Raina Zaizov Pediatric Hematology Oncology Division, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel."", ""Willem-Alexander Children's Hospital, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands."", 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Children, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Pediatric Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Medical Park Antalya Hospital, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Rigshospitalet, Paediatric Clinic II, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Comenius University Children's Hospital, Bratislava, Slovakia."", 'Department of Hematology, Skanes University Hopsital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Pediatric Stem Cell Transplantation, UZH, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', ""Willem-Alexander Children's Hospital, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands."", ""St Anna Children's Hospital, Universitatsklinik fur Kinder- und Jugendheilkunde, Medizinische Universitat Wien, Vienna, Austria."", ""St Anna Children's Hospital, Universitatsklinik fur Kinder- und Jugendheilkunde, Medizinische Universitat Wien, Vienna, Austria."", ""St Anna Children's Hospital, Universitatsklinik fur Kinder- und Jugendheilkunde, Medizinische Universitat Wien, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2020/08/06 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-01014-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-01014-x [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2021 Jan;56(1):257-266. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-01014-x.

Hotspot mutations in SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 and loss of function mutations in ZRSR2 have revealed widely different aberrant splicing signatures with little overlap. However, previous studies lacked the power necessary to identify commonly mis-spliced transcripts in heterogeneous patient cohorts. By performing RNA-Seq on bone marrow samples from 1258 myeloid neoplasm patients and 63 healthy bone marrow donors, we identified transcripts frequently mis-spliced by mutated splicing factors (SF), rare SF mutations with common alternative splicing (AS) signatures, and SF-dependent neojunctions. We characterized 17,300 dysregulated AS events using a pipeline designed to predict the impact of mis-splicing on protein function. Meta-splicing analysis revealed a pattern of reduced levels of retained introns among disease samples that was exacerbated in patients with splicing factor mutations. These introns share characteristics with ""detained introns,"" a class of introns that have been shown to promote differentiation by detaining pro-proliferative transcripts in the nucleus. In this study, we have functionally characterized 17,300 targets of mis-splicing by the SF mutations, identifying a common pathway by which AS may promote maintenance of a proliferative state.","['Hershberger, Courtney E', 'Moyer, Devlin C', 'Adema, Vera', 'Kerr, Cassandra M', 'Walter, Wencke', 'Hutter, Stephan', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Baer, Constance', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Nadarajah, Niroshan', 'Twardziok, Sven', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Padgett, Richard A']","['Hershberger CE', 'Moyer DC', 'Adema V', 'Kerr CM', 'Walter W', 'Hutter S', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Baer C', 'Kern W', 'Nadarajah N', 'Twardziok S', 'Sekeres MA', 'Haferlach C', 'Haferlach T', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Padgett RA']","['Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences Department, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences Department, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences Department, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA. padgetr@ccf.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Loss of Function Mutation', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'RNA Splicing Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptome']",,,2020/08/06 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-1002-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-1002-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Apr;35(4):1108-1120. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-1002-y.

They found that critical transcriptomic perturbations could predict initiation and progression of the disease. This is an important step toward accurately predicting cancer evolution, which may eventually facilitate early diagnosis of cancer and disease recurrence, and which could potentially inform on timing of therapeutic interventions.See related article by Rockne et al., 3157.","['Kuijjer, Marieke L']",['Kuijjer ML'],"['Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. marieke.kuijjer@ncmm.uio.no.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Comment']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', 'Recurrence']",,,2020/08/06 06:00,2020/12/18 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['80/15/3072 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-1878 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2020 Aug 1;80(15):3072-3073. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-1878.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6280-3130'],,['Cancer Res. 2020 May 15;:.

Our results demonstrate that the levels of PIM1 protein kinase is elevated in early T-cell precursor ALL (ETP-ALL) but not in mature T-ALL primary samples. Small-molecule PIM inhibitor (PIMi) treatment decreases leukemia burden in ETP-ALL. However, treatment of animals carrying ETP-ALL with PIMi was not curative. To model other pathways that could be targeted to complement PIMi activity, HSB-2 cells, previously characterized as a PIMi-sensitive T-ALL cell line, were grown in increasing doses of PIMi. Gene set enrichment analysis of RNA sequencing data and functional enrichment of network modules demonstrated that the HOXA9, mTOR, MYC, NFkappaB, and PI3K-AKT pathways were activated in HSB-2 cells after long-term PIM inhibition. Reverse phase protein array-based pathway activation mapping demonstrated alterations in the mTOR, PI3K-AKT, and NFkappaB pathways, as well. PIMi-tolerant HSB-2 cells contained phosphorylated RelA-S536 consistent with activation of the NFkappaB pathway. The combination of NFkappaB and PIMis markedly reduced the proliferation in PIMi-resistant leukemic cells showing that this pathway plays an important role in driving the growth of T-ALL. Together these results demonstrate key pathways that are activated when HSB-2 cell line develop resistance to PIMi and suggest pathways that can be rationally targeted in combination with PIM kinases to inhibit T-ALL growth.","['Lim, James T', 'Singh, Neha', 'Leuvano, Libia A', 'Calvert, Valerie S', 'Petricoin, Emanuel F', 'Teachey, David T', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Padi, Megha', 'Kraft, Andrew S', 'Padi, Sathish K R']","['Lim JT', 'Singh N', 'Leuvano LA', 'Calvert VS', 'Petricoin EF', 'Teachey DT', 'Lock RB', 'Padi M', 'Kraft AS', 'Padi SKR']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'Center for Applied Proteomics and Molecular Medicine, George Mason University, Manassas, Virginia.', 'Center for Applied Proteomics and Molecular Medicine, George Mason University, Manassas, Virginia.', ""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, School of Women's and Children's Health, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, Australia."", 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona.', 'Bioinformatics Shared Resource, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, Arizona.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona. sathishpadi@gmail.com akraft@uacc.arizona.edu.', 'University of Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona. sathishpadi@gmail.com akraft@uacc.arizona.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2020/08/06 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-20-0160 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0160 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2020 Sep;19(9):1809-1821. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0160.

Here, MYC, a potent oncogene, is an antinecroptotic factor that directly suppresses the formation of the RIPK1-RIPK3 complex. Gene set enrichment analyses reveal that the MYC pathway is the most prominently down-regulated signaling pathway during necroptosis. Depletion or deletion of MYC promotes the RIPK1-RIPK3 interaction, thereby stabilizing the RIPK1 and RIPK3 proteins and facilitating necroptosis. Interestingly, MYC binds to RIPK3 in the cytoplasm and inhibits the interaction between RIPK1 and RIPK3 in vitro. Furthermore, MYC-nick, a truncated form that is mainly localized in the cytoplasm, prevented TNF-induced necroptosis. Finally, down-regulation of MYC enhances necroptosis in leukemia cells and suppresses tumor growth in a xenograft model upon treatment with birinapant and emricasan. MYC-mediated suppression of necroptosis is a mechanism of necroptosis resistance in cancer, and approaches targeting MYC to induce necroptosis represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for cancer.","['Seong, Daehyeon', 'Jeong, Manhyung', 'Seo, Jinho', 'Lee, Ji-Yoon', 'Hwang, Chi Hyun', 'Shin, Ho-Chul', 'Shin, Jeong Yoon', 'Nam, Young Woo', 'Jo, Jeong Yeon', 'Lee, Haeseung', 'Kim, Hye-Jung', 'Kim, Hwa-Ryeon', 'Oh, Ji Hoon', 'Ha, Sang-Jun', 'Kim, Seung Jun', 'Roe, Jae-Seok', 'Kim, Wankyu', 'Cheong, June-Won', 'Bae, Kwang-Hee', 'Lee, Sang Chul', 'Oberst, Andrew', 'Vandenabeele, Peter', 'Shin, Dong Hoon', 'Lee, Eun-Woo', 'Song, Jaewhan']","['Seong D', 'Jeong M', 'Seo J', 'Lee JY', 'Hwang CH', 'Shin HC', 'Shin JY', 'Nam YW', 'Jo JY', 'Lee H', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim HR', 'Oh JH', 'Ha SJ', 'Kim SJ', 'Roe JS', 'Kim W', 'Cheong JW', 'Bae KH', 'Lee SC', 'Oberst A', 'Vandenabeele P', 'Shin DH', 'Lee EW', 'Song J']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, 120-749 Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, 120-749 Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, 120-749 Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Environmental Diseases Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, 34141 Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Metabolic Regulation Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, 34141 Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, 120-749 Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Disease Target Structure Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, 34141 Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, 120-749 Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, 120-749 Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Cancer Science and Policy, National Cancer Center, 10408 Goyang, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Ewha Research Center for Systems Biology, Ewha Womans University, 03760 Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'New Drug Development Center, Korea Biotechnology Industry Organization Osong Medical Innovation Foundation, 28160 Cheongju-si, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, 120-749 Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, 120-749 Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, 120-749 Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Disease Target Structure Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, 34141 Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, 120-749 Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Ewha Research Center for Systems Biology, Ewha Womans University, 03760 Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 03722 Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Metabolic Regulation Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, 34141 Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Metabolic Regulation Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, 34141 Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98109.', 'Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie-University of Ghent Center for Inflammation Research, Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnolgie, 9052 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, 9000 Ghent, Belgium.', 'Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Cancer Science and Policy, National Cancer Center, 10408 Goyang, Republic of Korea.', 'Metabolic Regulation Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, 34141 Daejeon, Republic of Korea;

In this study, we evaluated the outcomes of AML patients with late relapse at our institution and reviewed the literature for these patients. The study cohort consisted of nine AML patients with late relapse. The median interval between CR1 and AML relapse was 6.1 years (range: 5.116.2 years). At relapse, the karyotype was different from the initial AML diagnosis in 50% of patients. At the time of AML relapse, seven patients received induction chemotherapy and two patients received hypomethylating agents with an overall CR rate of 66%. The median time to relapse after achieving second CR (CR2) was 16.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 9.4, NA]. The median overall survival after first relapse was 28.6 months (95% CI: 7.3, 3.466.5 months). Despite initial CR after reinduction therapy, relapse rates are still high, suggesting that alternative strategies for postremission therapies are warranted in CR2. These approaches include the use of allogeneic hematogenic cell transplantation and the use of newly approved AML agents as maintenance therapy in nontransplant eligible patients.","['Patel, Arisha', 'Agha, Mounzer', 'Raptis, Anastasios', 'Hou, Jing-Zhou', 'Farah, Rafic', 'Redner, Robert L', 'Im, Annie', 'Dorritie, Kathleen A', 'Sehgal, Alison', 'Rossetti, James', 'Saul, Melissa', 'Normolle, Daniel', 'Lontos, Konstantinos', 'Boyiadzis, Michael']","['Patel A', 'Agha M', 'Raptis A', 'Hou JZ', 'Farah R', 'Redner RL', 'Im A', 'Dorritie KA', 'Sehgal A', 'Rossetti J', 'Saul M', 'Normolle D', 'Lontos K', 'Boyiadzis M']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer CenterPittsburgh, PAUSA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer CenterPittsburgh, PAUSA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer CenterPittsburgh, PAUSA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer CenterPittsburgh, PAUSA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer CenterPittsburgh, PAUSA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer CenterPittsburgh, PAUSA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer CenterPittsburgh, PAUSA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer CenterPittsburgh, PAUSA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer CenterPittsburgh, PAUSA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer CenterPittsburgh, PAUSA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer CenterPittsburgh, PAUSA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer CenterPittsburgh, PAUSA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer CenterPittsburgh, PAUSA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer CenterPittsburgh, PAUSA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Decitabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/08/06 06:00,2021/10/27 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/096504020X15965357399750 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2021 Sep 7;28(7):811-814. doi: 10.3727/096504020X15965357399750.

ADCs are comprised of a drug with cytotoxic activity cross-linked to a monoclonal antibody, targeting antigens expressed at higher levels on tumor cells than on normal cells. By providing a selective targeting mechanism for cytotoxic drugs, ADCs improve the therapeutic index in clinical practice. In this review, the chemistry of ADC linker conjugation together with strategies adopted to improve antibody tolerability (by reducing antigenicity) are examined, with particular attention to ADCs approved by the regulatory agencies (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)) for treating cancer patients. Recent developments in engineering Immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and antibody humanization have greatly reduced some of the problems of the first generation of ADCs, beset by problems, such as random coupling of the payload and immunogenicity of the antibody. ADC development and clinical use is a fast, evolving area, and will likely prove an important modality for the treatment of cancer in the near future.","['Ponziani, Sara', 'Di Vittorio, Giulia', 'Pitari, Giuseppina', 'Cimini, Anna Maria', 'Ardini, Matteo', 'Gentile, Roberta', 'Iacobelli, Stefano', 'Sala, Gianluca', 'Capone, Emily', 'Flavell, David J', 'Ippoliti, Rodolfo', 'Giansanti, Francesco']","['Ponziani S', 'Di Vittorio G', 'Pitari G', 'Cimini AM', 'Ardini M', 'Gentile R', 'Iacobelli S', 'Sala G', 'Capone E', 'Flavell DJ', 'Ippoliti R', 'Giansanti F']","[""Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L'Aquila, I-67100 L'Aquila, Italy."", 'MediaPharma SrL, I-66013 Chieti, Italy.', ""Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L'Aquila, I-67100 L'Aquila, Italy."", ""Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L'Aquila, I-67100 L'Aquila, Italy."", ""Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L'Aquila, I-67100 L'Aquila, Italy."", 'MediaPharma SrL, I-66013 Chieti, Italy.', 'MediaPharma SrL, I-66013 Chieti, Italy.', 'MediaPharma SrL, I-66013 Chieti, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, University of Chieti-Pescara, I-66100 Chieti, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, University of Chieti-Pescara, I-66100 Chieti, Italy.', 'The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', ""Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L'Aquila, I-67100 L'Aquila, Italy."", ""Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L'Aquila, I-67100 L'Aquila, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Antibody-Drug Conjugate', 'Mabs', 'cancer therapy', 'cross-linking', 'drug targeting', 'payload']",2020/08/06 06:00,2021/02/23 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21155510 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21155510 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jul 31;21(15). pii: ijms21155510. doi: 10.3390/ijms21155510.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9044-3352', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4494-915X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6719-2535', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7145-4737', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8335-3412']",20200731,,,"['National project PON ricerca e innovazione 2014-2020/Italian Ministry of', 'Instruction, University, and Research']",PMC7432430,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, there has been no useful system developed for drug screening against HBV polymerase. In this study, we successfully obtained a highly purified reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of the polymerase, which has a template/primer and substrate binding activity, and established a novel high-throughput screening (HTS) system using purified RT protein for finding novel polymerase inhibitors. To examine whether the assay system provides reliable results, we tested the small scale screening using pharmacologically active compounds. As a result, the pilot screening identified already-known anti-viral polymerase agents. Then, we screened 20,000 chemical compounds and newly identified four hits. Several of these compounds inhibited not only the HBV RT substrate and/ template/primer binding activity, but also Moloney murine leukemia virus RT activity, which has an elongation activity. Finally, these candidates did show to be effective even in the cell-based assay. Our screening system provides a useful tool for searching candidate inhibitors against HBV.","['Ohsaki, Eriko', 'Ueda, Keiji']","['Ohsaki E', 'Ueda K']","['Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (P protein, Hepatitis B virus)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', '*Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Gene Products, pol/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Hepatitis B virus/*drug effects/enzymology', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Small Molecule Libraries', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*hepatitis B virus', '*high-throughput screening', '*polymerase', '*reverse transcriptase']",2020/08/06 06:00,2021/02/25 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['v12080840 [pii]', '10.3390/v12080840 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2020 Jul 31;12(8). pii: v12080840. doi: 10.3390/v12080840.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1496-0964'],20200731,,,,PMC7472185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal functioning of this system has been observed in cancer and neurological diseases. The 20S proteasomes, essential components of the UPS, are present not only within the cells but also in the extracellular space, and their concentration in blood plasma has been found to be elevated and dependent upon the disease state, being of prognostic significance in patients suffering from cancer, liver diseases, and autoimmune diseases. However, functions of extracellular proteasomes and mechanisms of their release by cells remain largely unknown. The main mechanism of proteasome activity regulation is provided by modulation of their composition and post-translational modifications (PTMs). Moreover, diverse PTMs of proteins are known to participate in the loading of specific elements into extracellular vesicles. Since previous studies have revealed that the transport of extracellular proteasomes may occur via extracellular vesicles, we have set out to explore the PTMs of extracellular proteasomes in comparison to cellular counterparts. In this work, cellular and extracellular proteasomes were affinity purified and separated by SDS-PAGE for subsequent trypsinization and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. In total, we could identify 64 and 55 PTM sites in extracellular and cellular proteasomes, respectively, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and succinylation. We observed novel sites of acetylation at K238 and K192 of the proteasome subunits beta2 and beta3, respectively, that are specific for extracellular proteasomes. Moreover, cellular proteasomes show specific acetylation at K227 of alpha2 and ubiquitination at K201 of beta3. Interestingly, succinylation of beta6 at the residue K228 seems not to be present exclusively in extracellular proteasomes, whereas both extracellular and cellular proteasomes may also be acetylated at this site. The same situation takes place at K201 of the beta3 subunit where ubiquitination is seemingly specific for cellular proteasomes. Moreover, crosstalk between acetylation, ubiquitination, and succinylation has been observed in the subunit alpha3 of both proteasome populations. These data will serve as a basis for further studies, aimed at dissection of the roles of extracellular proteasome-specific PTMs in terms of the function of these proteasomes and mechanism of their transport into extracellular space.","['Tsimokha, Anna S', 'Artamonova, Tatiana O', 'Diakonov, Egor E', 'Khodorkovskii, Mikhail A', 'Tomilin, Alexey N']","['Tsimokha AS', 'Artamonova TO', 'Diakonov EE', 'Khodorkovskii MA', 'Tomilin AN']","['Institute of Cytology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 4 Tikhoretsky Ave., 194064 Saint-Petersburg, Russia.', 'Institute of Cytology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 4 Tikhoretsky Ave., 194064 Saint-Petersburg, Russia.', 'Institute of Nanobiotechnologies, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, 29 Polytechnicheskaya Str., 195251 Saint-Petersburg, Russia.', 'Institute of Cytology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 4 Tikhoretsky Ave., 194064 Saint-Petersburg, Russia.', 'Institute of Cytology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 4 Tikhoretsky Ave., 194064 Saint-Petersburg, Russia.', 'Institute of Nanobiotechnologies, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, 29 Polytechnicheskaya Str., 195251 Saint-Petersburg, Russia.', 'Institute of Cytology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 4 Tikhoretsky Ave., 194064 Saint-Petersburg, Russia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Peptides/analysis/chemistry', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",['NOTNLM'],"['affinity purification', 'extracellular proteasome', 'fourier transform ion cyclotron mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS)', 'human leukemia K562 cells', 'matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)', 'post-translational modifications (PTMs)']",2020/08/06 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25153504 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25153504 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Jul 31;25(15). pii: molecules25153504. doi: 10.3390/molecules25153504.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8261-2750', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0069-0561', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1137-7167']",20200731,,,['18-04-01168/Russian Foundation for Basic Research'],PMC7435879,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The choroid plexus (CP) is a potential entry site, and, to some extent, invasion resembles CNS homing of lymphocytes during healthy state. Given exosomes may precondition target tissue, the present work aims to investigate if leukemia-derived exosomes contribute to a permissive phenotype of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Leukemia-derived exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation from the cell lines SD-1, Nalm-6, and P12-Ichikawa (P12). Adhesion and uptake to CP epithelial cells and the significance on subsequent ALL transmigration across the barrier was studied in a human BCSFB in vitro model based on the HiBCPP cell line. The various cell lines markedly differed regarding exosome uptake to HiBCPP and biological significance. SD-1-derived exosomes associated to target cells unspecifically without detectable cellular effects. Whereas Nalm-6 and P12-derived exosomes incorporated by dynamin-dependent endocytosis, uptake in the latter could be diminished by integrin blocking. In addition, only P12-derived exosomes led to facilitated transmigration of the parental leukemia cells. In conclusion, we provide evidence that, to a varying extent, leukemia-derived exosomes may facilitate CNS invasion of ALL across the BCSFB without destruction of the barrier integrity.","['Erb, Ulrike', 'Hikel, Julia', 'Meyer, Svenja', 'Ishikawa, Hiroshi', 'Worst, Thomas S', 'Nitschke, Katja', 'Nuhn, Philipp', 'Porubsky, Stefan', 'Weiss, Christel', 'Schroten, Horst', 'Adam, Rudiger', 'Karremann, Michael']","['Erb U', 'Hikel J', 'Meyer S', 'Ishikawa H', 'Worst TS', 'Nitschke K', 'Nuhn P', 'Porubsky S', 'Weiss C', 'Schroten H', 'Adam R', 'Karremann M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Mannheim, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Mannheim, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Mannheim, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Regenerative Medicine, Department of Neurosurgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan.', 'Department of Urology and Urosurgery, University Medical Center Mannheim, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Urology and Urosurgery, University Medical Center Mannheim, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Urology and Urosurgery, University Medical Center Mannheim, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, 55101 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Statistics and Biomathematics, University Medical Center Mannheim, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Mannheim, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Mannheim, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Mannheim, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Choroid Plexus/*metabolism/pathology', 'Endocytosis/genetics', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Extracellular Vesicles/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Transport/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['central nervous system infiltration', 'choroid plexus', 'exosomes', 'pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2020/08/06 06:00,2021/02/23 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21155491 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21155491 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jul 31;21(15). pii: ijms21155491. doi: 10.3390/ijms21155491.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9961-4752'],20200731,,,"['n.a./DLFH Aktion fur Krebskranke Kinder Mannheim', 'n.a./mcon goes golf']",PMC7432056,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unbalanced competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) promotes tumorigenesis and progression, and greatly contributes to tumor risk classification and prognosis. However, the comprehensive analysis of the circular RNA (circRNA)-long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network in the prognosis of AML is still rarely reported. METHOD: We obtained transcriptome data of AML and normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-tissue Expression (GTEx), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, and identified differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs. Then, the targeting relationships among lncRNA-miRNA, circRNA-miRNA, and miRNA-mRNA were predicted, and the survival related hub mRNAs were further screened by univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression. Finally, the AML prognostic circRNA-lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA regulatory network was established. RESULTS: We identified prognostic 6 hub mRNAs (TM6SF1, ZMAT1, MANSC1, PYCARD, SLC38A1, and LRRC4) through Cox regression model, and divided the AML samples into high and low risk groups according to the risk score obtained by multivariate Cox regression. Survival analysis verified that the survival rate of the high-risk group was significantly reduced (p < 0.0001). The prognostic ceRNA network of 6 circRNAs, 32 lncRNAs, 8 miRNAs, and 6 mRNAs was established according to the targeting relationship between 6 hub mRNAs and other RNAs. CONCLUSION: In this study, ceRNA network jointly participated by circRNAs and lncRNAs was established for the first time. It comprehensively elucidated the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of AML, and identified novel AML prognostic biomarkers, which has important guiding significance for the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and further scientific research of AML.","['Cheng, Yaqi', 'Su, Yaru', 'Wang, Shoubi', 'Liu, Yurun', 'Jin, Lin', 'Wan, Qi', 'Liu, Ying', 'Li, Chaoyang', 'Sang, Xuan', 'Yang, Liu', 'Liu, Chang', 'Wang, Zhichong']","['Cheng Y', 'Su Y', 'Wang S', 'Liu Y', 'Jin L', 'Wan Q', 'Liu Y', 'Li C', 'Sang X', 'Yang L', 'Liu C', 'Wang Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,"['0 (Amino Acid Transport System A)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (LRRC4 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (PYCARD protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SLC38A1 protein, human)', '0 (TM6SF1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Transport System A/genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Circular/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*ceRNA network', '*prognosis']",2020/08/06 06:00,2021/03/18 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/18 06:00 [medline]']","['genes11080868 [pii]', '10.3390/genes11080868 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2020 Jul 31;11(8). pii: genes11080868. doi: 10.3390/genes11080868.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7716-3500', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7284-4243']",20200731,,,,PMC7465400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the development of new therapies in CLL, drug resistance and disease relapse still occur. Recently, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), a secreted glycoprotein, has been suggested to have a critical role in the biology of tumors. Thus, we investigated the relevance of NGAL in CLL pathogenesis, analyzed the expression of its cellular receptor (NGAL-R) on malignant B cells and tested whether CLL cells are resistant to apoptosis through an autocrine process involving NGAL and NGAL-R. We observed that NGAL concentrations were elevated in the serum of CLL patients at diagnosis. After treatment (and regardless of the therapeutic regimen), serum NGAL levels normalized in CLL patients in remission but not in relapsed patients. In parallel, NGAL and NGAL-R were upregulated in leukemic cells from untreated CLL patients when compared to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and returned to basal levels in PBMCs from patients in remission. Cultured CLL cells released endogenous NGAL. Anti-NGAL-R antibodies enhanced NGAL-R(+) leukemia cell death. Conversely, recombinant NGAL protected NGAL-R(+) CLL cells against apoptosis by activating a STAT3/Mcl-1 signaling pathway. Our results suggest that NGAL and NGAL-R, overexpressed in untreated CLL, participate in the deregulation of the apoptotic machinery in CLL cells, and may be potential therapeutic clues for CLL treatment.","['Bauvois, Brigitte', 'Pramil, Elodie', 'Jondreville, Ludovic', 'Chapiro, Elise', 'Quiney, Claire', 'Maloum, Karim', 'Susin, Santos A', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence']","['Bauvois B', 'Pramil E', 'Jondreville L', 'Chapiro E', 'Quiney C', 'Maloum K', 'Susin SA', 'Nguyen-Khac F']","['Cell Death and Drug Resistance in Lymphoproliferative Disorders Team, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM, Sorbonne University, Paris University, F-75006 Paris, France.', 'Cell Death and Drug Resistance in Lymphoproliferative Disorders Team, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM, Sorbonne University, Paris University, F-75006 Paris, France.', 'Cell Death and Drug Resistance in Lymphoproliferative Disorders Team, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM, Sorbonne University, Paris University, F-75006 Paris, France.', 'Cell Death and Drug Resistance in Lymphoproliferative Disorders Team, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM, Sorbonne University, Paris University, F-75006 Paris, France.', 'Biological Hematology Department, Hospital Group Pitie-Salpetriere, F-75013 Paris, France.', 'Cell Death and Drug Resistance in Lymphoproliferative Disorders Team, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM, Sorbonne University, Paris University, F-75006 Paris, France.', 'Biological Hematology Department, Hospital Group Pitie-Salpetriere, F-75013 Paris, France.', 'Biological Hematology Department, Hospital Group Pitie-Salpetriere, F-75013 Paris, France.', 'Cell Death and Drug Resistance in Lymphoproliferative Disorders Team, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM, Sorbonne University, Paris University, F-75006 Paris, France.', 'Cell Death and Drug Resistance in Lymphoproliferative Disorders Team, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM, Sorbonne University, Paris University, F-75006 Paris, France.', 'Biological Hematology Department, Hospital Group Pitie-Salpetriere, F-75013 Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Mcl-1', 'NGAL', 'NGAL-R', 'STAT3', 'apoptosis', 'relapse', 'remission', 'survival']",2020/08/06 06:00,2020/08/06 06:01,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/06 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12082124 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12082124 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jul 31;12(8). pii: cancers12082124. doi: 10.3390/cancers12082124.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-1751-6922', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3366-1628']",20200731,,,,PMC7465759,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown an expression of NOX subunits in AML cell lines while NOX activity is lacking in the absence of exogenous stimulation. Here, we used AML cell lines as models to investigate the specificity of VAS3947, a current NOX inhibitor. Results demonstrated that VAS3947 induces apoptosis in AML cells independently of its anti-NOX activity. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that VAS3947 thiol alkylates cysteine residues of glutathione (GSH), while also interacting with proteins. Remarkably, VAS3947 decreased detectable GSH in the MV-4-11 cell line, thereby suggesting possible oxidative stress induction. However, a decrease in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels was observed by flow cytometry without disturbance of mitochondrial mass and membrane potential. Thus, assuming the consequences of VAS3947 treatment on protein structure, we examined its impact on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. An acute unfolded protein response (UPR) was triggered shortly after VAS3947 exposure, through the activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IRE1alpha) and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) pathways. Overall, VAS3947 induces apoptosis independently of anti-NOX activity, via UPR activation, mainly due to aggregation and misfolding of proteins.","['El Dor, Maya', 'Dakik, Hassan', 'Polomski, Marion', 'Haudebourg, Eloi', 'Brachet, Marie', 'Gouilleux, Fabrice', 'Prie, Gildas', 'Zibara, Kazem', 'Mazurier, Frederic']","['El Dor M', 'Dakik H', 'Polomski M', 'Haudebourg E', 'Brachet M', 'Gouilleux F', 'Prie G', 'Zibara K', 'Mazurier F']","['EA 7501 GICC, University of Tours, CNRS ERL7001 LNOx, Batiment Dutrochet, 10 boulevard Tonnelle, BP3223, CEDEX 1, 37032 Tours, France.', 'PRASE, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'EA 7501 GICC, University of Tours, CNRS ERL7001 LNOx, Batiment Dutrochet, 10 boulevard Tonnelle, BP3223, CEDEX 1, 37032 Tours, France.', 'EA 7501 GICC, University of Tours, IMT, 31 Avenue Monge, 37200 Tours, France.', 'EA 7501 GICC, University of Tours, IMT, 31 Avenue Monge, 37200 Tours, France.', 'EA 7501 GICC, University of Tours, CNRS ERL7001 LNOx, Batiment Dutrochet, 10 boulevard Tonnelle, BP3223, CEDEX 1, 37032 Tours, France.', 'EA 7501 GICC, University of Tours, CNRS ERL7001 LNOx, Batiment Dutrochet, 10 boulevard Tonnelle, BP3223, CEDEX 1, 37032 Tours, France.', 'EA 7501 GICC, University of Tours, IMT, 31 Avenue Monge, 37200 Tours, France.', 'PRASE, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Biology Department, Faculty of Sciences-I, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'EA 7501 GICC, University of Tours, CNRS ERL7001 LNOx, Batiment Dutrochet, 10 boulevard Tonnelle, BP3223, CEDEX 1, 37032 Tours, France.', 'EA 7501 GICC, University of Tours, IMT, 31 Avenue Monge, 37200 Tours, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (3-benzyl-7-(2-oxazolyl)thio-1,2,3-triazolo(4,5-d)pyrimidine)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidases/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology', 'Unfolded Protein Response/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['NADPH oxidases', 'VAS3947', 'cysteine thiol alkylation', 'endoplasmic reticulum', 'leukemia', 'oxidative stress', 'unfolded protein response']",2020/08/06 06:00,2021/02/23 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21155470 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21155470 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jul 31;21(15). pii: ijms21155470. doi: 10.3390/ijms21155470.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6047-1718', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9887-072X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6984-7096']",20200731,,,"['xxxxx/Ligue Contre le Cancer', 'xxxxx/Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer']",PMC7432790,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To relieve the complicated process with an efficient and automatic method, we propose the Attention-aware Residual Network based Manifold Learning model (ARML) to classify WBCs. The proposed ARML model leverages the adaptive attention-aware residual learning to exploit the category-relevant image-level features and strengthen the first-order feature representation ability. To learn more discriminatory information than the first-order ones, the second-order features are characterized. Afterwards, ARML encodes both the first- and second-order features with Gaussian embedding into the Riemannian manifold to learn the underlying non-linear structure of the features for classification. ARML can be trained in an end-to-end fashion, and the learnable parameters are iteratively optimized. 10800 WBCs images (1800 images for each type) is collected, 9000 images and five-fold cross-validation are used for training and validation of the model, while additional 1800 images for testing. The results show that ARML achieving average classification accuracy of 0.953 outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with fewer trainable parameters. In the ablation study, ARML achieves improved accuracy against its three variants: without manifold learning (AR), without attention-aware learning (RML), and AR without attention-aware learning. The t-SNE results illustrate that ARML has learned more distinguishable features than the comparison methods, which benefits the WBCs classification. ARML provides a clinically feasible WBCs classification solution for leukemia diagnose with an efficient manner.","['Huang, Pu', 'Wang, Jing', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Shen, Yajuan', 'Liu, Cong', 'Song, Weiqing', 'Wu, Shangshang', 'Zuo, Yuwei', 'Lu, Zhiming', 'Li, Dengwang']","['Huang P', 'Wang J', 'Zhang J', 'Shen Y', 'Liu C', 'Song W', 'Wu S', 'Zuo Y', 'Lu Z', 'Li D']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,101604520,,IM,"['*Attention', '*Leukocytes']",,,2020/08/06 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1109/JBHI.2020.3012711 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform. 2021 Apr;25(4):1206-1214. doi: 10.1109/JBHI.2020.3012711.

Several Gaussian graphical model-based methods have been proposed to deal with this task. However, most existing methods define the differential networks as the difference of precision matrices, which may include false differential edges caused by the change of conditional variances. In addition, prior information about the condition-specific networks and the differential networks can be obtained from other domains. It is useful to incorporate prior information into differential network analysis. In this study, we propose a new differential network analysis method to address the above challenges. Instead of using the precision matrices, we define the differential networks as the difference of partial correlations, which can exclude the spurious differential edges due to the variants of conditional variances. Furthermore, prior information from multiple hypothesis testing is incorporated using a weighted fused penalty. Simulation study shows that our method outperforms the competing methods. We also apply our method to identify the differential network between Luminal A and Basal-like subtypes of breast tumors and the differential network between acute myeloid leukemia tumor and normal samples. The hub genes in the estimated differential networks carry out important biological functions.","['Tan, Yu-Ting', 'Ou-Yang, Le', 'Jiang, Xingpeng', 'Yan, Hong', 'Zhang, Xiao-Fei']","['Tan YT', 'Ou-Yang L', 'Jiang X', 'Yan H', 'Zhang XF']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,,IM,,,,2020/08/06 06:00,2020/08/06 06:00,['2020/08/06 06:00'],"['2020/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1109/TCBB.2020.3002906 [doi]'],aheadofprint,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform. 2020 Jun 16;PP. doi: 10.1109/TCBB.2020.3002906.,,20200616,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms by which redox alterations impact cellular sensitivity to anticancer drugs remain elusive. Here we have identified the mitochondrial isoform of thioredoxin reductase 3 (mtTXNRD3), through RT-PCR microarray screen, as a key molecule that confers drug resistance to sorafenib and other clinical anticancer agents. High expression of mtTXNRD3 is detected in drug-resistant leukemia and hepatocellular carcinoma cells associated with significant metabolic alterations manifested by low mitochondrial respiration and high glycolysis. Mechanistically, high mtTXNRD3 activity keeps the mitochondrial thioredoxin2 (Trx2) in a reduced stage that in turn stabilizes several key survival molecules including HK2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and MCL-1, leading to increased cell survival and drug resistance. Pharmacological inhibition of thioredoxin reductase by auranofin effectively overcomes such drug resistance in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that targeting this redox mechanism may be a feasible strategy to treat drug-resistant cancer.","['Liu, Xiaoxia', 'Zhang, Yanyu', 'Lu, Wenhua', 'Han, Yi', 'Yang, Jing', 'Jiang, Weiye', 'You, Xin', 'Luo, Yao', 'Wen, Shijun', 'Hu, Yumin', 'Huang, Peng']","['Liu X', 'Zhang Y', 'Lu W', 'Han Y', 'Yang J', 'Jiang W', 'You X', 'Luo Y', 'Wen S', 'Hu Y', 'Huang P']","['Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China; The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong Institute of Gastroenterology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Colorectal and Pelvic Floor Diseases, Supported By National Key Clinical Discipline, Guangzhou, 510655, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China; Metabolic Innovation Center, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China.

Although it may be reasonable to assume feasibility and efficiency of apheresis for CAR-T cell manufacture, several idiosyncrasies of these patients warrant their separate analysis: target cells (mononuclear cells [MNC] and T-cells) are relatively few which may instruct the selection of apheresis technology, low body weight, and, hence, low total blood volume (TBV) can restrict process and product volume, and patients may be in compromised health. We here report outcome data from 46 consecutive leukaphereses in 33 unique pediatric patients performed for the purpose of CD19-CAR-T-cell manufacturing. Apheresis targets of 2x10(9) MNC/1x10(9) T-cells were defined by marketing authorization holder specification. Patient weight was 8 to 84 kg; TBV was 0.6 to 5.1 L. Spectra Optia apheresis technology was used. For 23 patients, a single apheresis sufficed to generate enough cells and manufacture CAR-T-cells, the remainder required two aphereses to meet target dose and/or two apheresis series because of production failure. Aphereses were technically feasible and clinically tolerable without serious adverse effects. The median collection efficiencies for MNC and T-cells were 53% and 56%, respectively. In summary, CAR apheresis in pediatric patients, including the very young, is feasible, safe and efficient, but the specified cell dose targets can be challenging in smaller children. Continuous monitoring of apheresis outcomes is advocated in order to maintain quality.","['Jarisch, Andrea', 'Rettinger, Eva', 'Sorensen, Jan', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Schafer, Richard', 'Seifried, Erhard', 'Bader, Peter', 'Bonig, Halvard']","['Jarisch A', 'Rettinger E', 'Sorensen J', 'Klingebiel T', 'Schafer R', 'Seifried E', 'Bader P', 'Bonig H']","['Division for Stem Cell Transplantation, Immunology and Intensive Care Medicine, Department for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation, Immunology and Intensive Care Medicine, Department for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation, Immunology and Intensive Care Medicine, Department for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation, Immunology and Intensive Care Medicine, Department for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'German Red Cross Blood Service Baden-Wurttemberg-Hessen, Institute Frankfurt/Main, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'German Red Cross Blood Service Baden-Wurttemberg-Hessen, Institute Frankfurt/Main, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation, Immunology and Intensive Care Medicine, Department for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'German Red Cross Blood Service Baden-Wurttemberg-Hessen, Institute Frankfurt/Main, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Apher,Journal of clinical apheresis,8216305,"['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Infant', 'Leukapheresis/*methods', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*blood', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell therapy', 'adoptive transfer', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'collection efficiency', 'unstimulated apheresis']",2020/08/05 06:00,2021/11/04 06:00,['2020/08/05 06:00'],"['2020/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jca.21812 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Apher. 2020 Sep;35(5):398-405. doi: 10.1002/jca.21812.

To this aim, computational methods and experimental measurements based on in vivo label-retaining assays can be coupled to explore the dynamic behavior of tumoral cells. ProCell is a software that exploits flow cytometry data to model and simulate the kinetics of fluorescence loss that is due to stochastic events of cell division. Since the rate of cell division is not known, ProCell embeds a calibration process that might require thousands of stochastic simulations to properly infer the parameterization of cell proliferation models. To mitigate the high computational costs, in this paper we introduce a parallel implementation of ProCell's simulation algorithm, named cuProCell, which leverages Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Dynamic Parallelism was used to efficiently manage the cell duplication events, in a radically different way with respect to common computing architectures. We present the advantages of cuProCell for the analysis of different models of cell proliferation in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), using data collected from the spleen of human xenografts in mice. We show that, by exploiting GPUs, our method is able to not only automatically infer the models' parameterization, but it is also 237x faster than the sequential implementation. This study highlights the presence of a relevant percentage of quiescent and potentially chemoresistant cells in AML in vivo, and suggests that maintaining a dynamic equilibrium among the different proliferating cell populations might play an important role in disease progression.","['Nobile, Marco S', 'Nisoli, Eric', 'Vlachou, Thalia', 'Spolaor, Simone', 'Cazzaniga, Paolo', 'Mauri, Giancarlo', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Besozzi, Daniela']","['Nobile MS', 'Nisoli E', 'Vlachou T', 'Spolaor S', 'Cazzaniga P', 'Mauri G', 'Pelicci PG', 'Besozzi D']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,101604520,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Computer Graphics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Mice', 'Software']",,,2020/08/05 06:00,2021/09/25 06:00,['2020/08/05 06:00'],"['2020/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1109/JBHI.2020.3005423 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform. 2020 Nov;24(11):3173-3181. doi: 10.1109/JBHI.2020.3005423.

However, given the polypharmacology of dipyridamole, the mechanism by which it potentiates statin-induced apoptosis remains unclear. Here, we applied a pharmacological approach to identify the activity of dipyridamole specific to its synergistic anticancer interaction with statins. We evaluated compounds that phenocopy the individual activities of dipyridamole and assessed whether they could potentiate statin-induced cell death. Notably, we identified that a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, cilostazol, and other compounds that increase intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels potentiate statin-induced apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma cells. Additionally, we demonstrated that both dipyridamole and cilostazol further inhibit statin-induced activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2, a known modulator of statin sensitivity, in a cAMP-independent manner. Taken together, our data support that PDE inhibitors such as dipyridamole and cilostazol can potentiate statin-induced apoptosis via a dual mechanism. Given that several PDE inhibitors are clinically approved for various indications, they are immediately available for testing in combination with statins for the treatment of hematological malignancies.","['Longo, Joseph', 'Pandyra, Aleksandra A', 'Stachura, Pawel', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Schimmer, Aaron D', 'Penn, Linda Z']","['Longo J', 'Pandyra AA', 'Stachura P', 'Minden MD', 'Schimmer AD', 'Penn LZ']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine II, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Infectious Diseases, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine II, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,"['0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sterols)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'N7Z035406B (Cilostazol)']",IM,"['Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cilostazol/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Sterols/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*SREBP2', '*cilostazol', '*dipyridamole', '*mevalonate pathway', '*phosphodiesterase inhibitor', '*statins']",2020/08/05 06:00,2021/09/11 06:00,['2020/08/05 06:00'],"['2020/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12775 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2020 Oct;14(10):2533-2545. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12775.

The objective of this research was to develop an integrated mechanistic model to evaluate the impact of venetoclax-rituximab combination therapy on MRD kinetics. Using data from 435 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, an integrated model was developed and validated that accounted for venetoclax dosing and pharmacokinetics, rituximab treatment, absolute lymphocyte count, and blood and bone marrow (BM) MRD data. Simulations of venetoclax-rituximab (six cycles) combination predicted the proportion (90% confidence interval) of patients with BM MRD below 10(-4) to be 57% (54-61%) and 63% (59-67%) at 12 and 24 months of treatment, respectively. Continued venetoclax treatment to 48 months only increased the predicted rate of negative BM MRD to 66% (63-70%). These results indicate that treatment with venetoclax-rituximab combination for a finite 2-year period would nearly maximize the rate of negative BM MRD (< 10(-4) ). Preliminary clinical data agree with these predictions and more long-term follow-up data are awaited to confirm the same.","['Gopalakrishnan, Sathej', 'Wierda, William', 'Chyla, Brenda', 'Menon, Rajeev', 'Miles, Dale', 'Humerickhouse, Rod', 'Awni, Walid', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed', 'Mensing, Sven', 'Freise, Kevin J']","['Gopalakrishnan S', 'Wierda W', 'Chyla B', 'Menon R', 'Miles D', 'Humerickhouse R', 'Awni W', 'Salem AH', 'Mensing S', 'Freise KJ']","['Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Oncology Biomarkers, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use', 'Sulfonamides/*therapeutic use']",,,2020/08/05 06:00,2021/05/22 06:00,['2020/08/05 06:00'],"['2020/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cpt.2005 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2021 Feb;109(2):424-432. doi: 10.1002/cpt.2005.

However, biomarkers and mechanisms underlying remain largely limited. Three microarray profiles, GSE78718 (K562 leukemia cell line), GSE45301 (U87-MG glioblastoma cell line), and GSE9589 (SW480 colon cancer cell line), were analyzed for the overlapped differentially expressed genes (DEGs). SurvExpress was used for the prognostic analysis of hub genes signature. Predicted transcription factors networks were built by NetworkAnalysis. Characterization between hub genes and immune cells was analyzed by the tumor immune estimation resources (TIMER) and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). The most significantly enriched pathway was lysosome. Hub genes included lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5 (HSPA5), lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2), integrin subunit alpha V (ITGAV), and transmembrane protein 30A (TMEM30A). Significant prognostic values of hub genes signature were identified in glioblastoma (P-value = 0.006), but not colon cancer. In colon cancer, ITGAV displayed remarkably high correlation with tumor immune infiltrating cells. In glioblastoma, the highest correlation was found between HSPA5 and dendritic cell. Moreover, distinct association of immune cells between cell and EV were identified via ssGSEA. This study identified biomarkers in EV with potential immunological insights and clinical values.","['Wang, Qiang', 'Yu, Chaoran']","['Wang Q', 'Yu C']","[""Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China."", ""Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China. chaoran_yu@yeah.net."", ""Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200025, People's Republic of China. chaoran_yu@yeah.net.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Databases, Genetic/statistics & numerical data', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Extracellular Vesicles/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Glioblastoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lysosomes/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Interaction Maps']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bioinformatics', 'Biomarker', 'Extracellular vesicle', 'Pan-cancer']",2020/08/05 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/08/05 06:00'],"['2020/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12032-020-01404-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12032-020-01404-7 [pii]']",epublish,Med Oncol. 2020 Aug 4;37(9):79. doi: 10.1007/s12032-020-01404-7.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4657-7975'],20200804,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, risks associated with lower dose exposures remain unclear, and there is little information available for the risk modification according to the dose-rate. There are few studies using animal models which might be able to provide complementary information on this association. In this study, the male stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP) was used as a model animal. The rats were acutely irradiated with doses between 0 and 1.0 Gy or chronically irradiated with a cumulative dose of 0.5 or 1.0 Gy (at a dose rate of 0.05 or 0.1 Gy/day, respectively). The onset time of stroke related symptoms in SHRSP was used as an endpoint for evaluating the effects of low dose and the low dose-rate gamma-ray exposures. With respect to acute exposure, the time to the onset of stroke in the irradiated rats suggested the presence of a threshold around 0.1 Gy. For the low dose-rate chronically exposed, no significant increase in stroke symptom was observed. These findings are novel and demonstrate that the SHRSP system can be used to determine the association between the risk of stroke and radiation exposure with high sensitivity. Moreover, these studies provide important information regarding the association between the low dose and low dose-rate radiation exposure and circulatory diseases, especially stroke.","['Takahashi, Norio', 'Misumi, Munechika', 'Murakami, Hideko', 'Niwa, Yasuharu', 'Ohishi, Waka', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Nagamachi, Akiko', 'Suzuki, Gen']","['Takahashi N', 'Misumi M', 'Murakami H', 'Niwa Y', 'Ohishi W', 'Inaba T', 'Nagamachi A', 'Suzuki G']","['Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Statistics, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Clinical Studies (Hiroshima), Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'International University of Health and Welfare Clinic, Otawara, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Stroke/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Low dose radiation', 'Low dose-rate radiation', 'Stroke', 'Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRSP)', 'Threshold']",2020/08/05 06:00,2021/07/07 06:00,['2020/08/05 06:00'],"['2020/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['5880384 [pii]', '10.1093/jrr/rraa050 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 2020 Sep 8;61(5):666-673. doi: 10.1093/jrr/rraa050.,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

In this paper, we have described the identification of a new cytotoxic protein (chondrosin) with selective activity against specific tumor cell lines, from C. reniformis, collected from the Liguria Sea. Chondrosin was extracted and purified using a salting out approach and molecular weight size exclusion chromatography. The cytotoxic fractions were then characterized by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis and matched the results with C. reniformis transcriptome database. The procedure allowed for identifying a full-length cDNA encoding for a 199-amino acids (aa) polypeptide, with a signal peptide of 21 amino acids. The mature protein has a theoretical molecular weight of 19611.12 and an IP of 5.11. Cell toxicity assays showed a selective action against some tumor cell lines (RAW 264.7 murine leukemia cells in particular). Cell death was determined by extracellular calcium intake, followed by cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species overproduction.

Eleven organoarsenic compounds were synthesized and tested for their effect on the asexual blood stages and sexual transmission stages of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum using in vitro assays. The inhibitory potential of the compounds on blood stage viability was tested on the chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive 3D7 and the CQ-resistant Dd2 strain using the Malstat assay. The most effective compounds were subsequently investigated for their effect on impairing gametocyte development and gametogenesis, using the gametocyte-producing NF54 strain in respective cell-based assays. Their potential toxicity was investigated on leukemia cell line Nalm-6 and non-infected erythrocytes. Five out of the 11 compounds showed antiplasmodial activities against 3D7, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging between 1.52 and 8.64 microM. Three of the compounds also acted against Dd2, with the most active compound As-8 exhibiting an IC50 of 0.35 microM. The five compounds also showed significant inhibitory effects on the parasite sexual stages at both IC50 and IC90 concentrations with As-8 displaying the best gametocytocidal activity. No hemolytic and cytotoxic effect was observed for any of the compounds. The organoarsenic compound As-8 may represent a good lead for the design of novel organoarsenic drugs with combined antimalarial and transmission blocking activities.","['Basova, Sofia', 'Wilke, Nathalie', 'Koch, Jan Christoph', 'Prokop, Aram', 'Berkessel, Albrecht', 'Pradel, Gabriele', 'Ngwa, Che Julius']","['Basova S', 'Wilke N', 'Koch JC', 'Prokop A', 'Berkessel A', 'Pradel G', 'Ngwa CJ']","['Division of Cellular and Applied Infection Biology, Institute of Zoology, RWTH Aachen University, Worringerweg 1, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', ""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Children's Hospital Cologne, Amsterdamer Strasse 59, 50735 Cologne, Germany."", 'Department of Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, University of Cologne, Greinstrasse 4, 50939 Cologne, Germany.', ""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Children's Hospital Cologne, Amsterdamer Strasse 59, 50735 Cologne, Germany."", 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Helios Hospital Schwerin, Wismarsche Strasse 393-397, 19049 Schwerin, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, University of Cologne, Greinstrasse 4, 50939 Cologne, Germany.', 'Division of Cellular and Applied Infection Biology, Institute of Zoology, RWTH Aachen University, Worringerweg 1, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Division of Cellular and Applied Infection Biology, Institute of Zoology, RWTH Aachen University, Worringerweg 1, 52074 Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Plasmodium falciparum', 'antimalarial', 'gametocytocidal', 'malaria', 'organoarsenic compound', 'transmission']",2020/08/05 06:00,2020/08/05 06:01,['2020/08/05 06:00'],"['2020/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/05 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines8080260 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines8080260 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2020 Aug 2;8(8). pii: biomedicines8080260. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines8080260.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0470-7428'],20200802,,,,PMC7459655,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The Mattie Miracle Cancer Foundation, in partnership with the American Psychosocial Oncology Society reviewed 22 letters of intent and 13 full grants and awarded small grants to researchers with high quality projects that aimed to implement any of the published 15 Standards of Care. For three of the highest rated funded research projects, we describe the Standard implemented, the novel research design and implementation strategies, and how the research findings might inform the development, implementation, and dissemination of effective solutions for bridging Standard-to-practice gaps. RESULTS: The first study presented is an innovative eHealth intervention for parents of children with cancer designed to improve family functioning and decrease symptoms of acute distress, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. The second study addresses the acceptability and feasibility of using daily text message assessments of oral chemotherapy adherence in adolescents and young adults with leukemia, and the third creates a blueprint for providing psychosocial services to siblings, including ways to overcome common implementation barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Several themes emerged from the studies presented, including (1) attention to barriers to previous attempts at implementation; (2) technology's role in delivering care; (3) the need for stakeholder involvement; and (4) consideration for multi-pronged solutions that address heterogeneity in care settings. Next steps for integrating the Standards of Psychosocial Care into clinical practice are discussed.","['Wiener, Lori', 'Canter, Kimberly', 'Long, Kristin', 'Psihogios, Alexandra M', 'Thompson, Amanda L']","['Wiener L', 'Canter K', 'Long K', 'Psihogios AM', 'Thompson AL']","['National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'A.I.

FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i) may resensitize cells to cytarabine (CYT). Improving treatment outcome of this combination may benefit from a mechanistic extrapolation approach from in vitro data. METHODS: The effects of CYT and several FLT3i on cell proliferation and cell cycle kinetics were examined in AML cell lines. The effect of FLT3i (quizartinib, midostaurin, sorafenib) on cell proliferation and cell cycle kinetics was assessed in AML cell lines with differing FLT3 status; HEL (negligible expression of wild-type FLT3), EOL1 (wild-type FLT3), MV4-11 (FLT3-ITD resulting in constitutively active isoform). Semi-mechanistic cell cycle models for CYT and FLT3i were developed. Clinical CYT and quizartinib pharmacokinetic dosage regimens were modeled. Survival of AML patients was described via a hazard model. Simulations exploring different CYT/quizartinib regimens were conducted with the goal of improving treatment outcome. RESULTS: FLT3 status was associated with sensitivity to CYT (HEL cells most sensitive > EOL1 > MV4-11 cells). This order of sensitivity is reversed for FLT3i. Cytarabine induced apoptosis in the S-phase while all FLT3i induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Simulations of candidate clinical regimens predict better cell kill upon adding quizartinib simultaneously with or immediately after CYT exposure. Overall survival was predicted to be significantly better with quizartinib 200 mg administered every 48 h vs every 24 h in patients with FLT3 aberrations. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous administration of quizartinib and CYT every other day is a promising combination regimen for AML patients with FLT3 mutations.","['Elmeliegy, Mohamed', 'Den Haese, Jason', 'Talati, Chetasi', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Jusko, William J']","['Elmeliegy M', 'Den Haese J', 'Talati C', 'Wetzler M', 'Jusko WJ']","['Pfizer, Inc., 10555 Science Center Dr., San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.

Currently, molecular biotechnology methods, such as gene overexpression, have been widely used to increase the production of metabolites. However, AQ biosynthetic genes and enzymes are poorly understood. In this study, an integrated study coupling RNA-Seq and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) were used to identify AQ synthesis-related genes and enzymes in Antrodia camphorata during coenzyme Q0-induced fermentation (FM). The upregulated genes related to acetyl-CoA synthesis indicated that acetyl-CoA enters the mevalonate pathway to form the farnesyl tail precursor of AQ. The metE gene for an enzyme with methyl transfer activity provided sufficient methyl groups for AQ structure formation. The CoQ2 and ubiA genes encode p-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyl transferase, linking coenzyme Q0 and the polyisoprene side chain to form coenzyme Q3. NADH is transformed into NAD+ and releases two electrons, which may be beneficial for the conversion of coenzyme Q3 to AQ. Understanding the biosynthetic genes and enzymes of AQ is important for improving its production by genetic means in the future.","['Liu, Xiaofeng', 'Xia, Yongjun', 'Zhang, Yao', 'Yang, Caiyun', 'Xiong, Zhiqiang', 'Song, Xin', 'Ai, Lianzhong']","['Liu X', 'Xia Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Yang C', 'Xiong Z', 'Song X', 'Ai L']","[""Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Food Microbiology, School of Medical Instrument and Food Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, 516 Jungong Road, Shanghai, 200093, People's Republic of China."", ""Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Food Microbiology, School of Medical Instrument and Food Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, 516 Jungong Road, Shanghai, 200093, People's Republic of China."", ""Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Food Microbiology, School of Medical Instrument and Food Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, 516 Jungong Road, Shanghai, 200093, People's Republic of China."", ""Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Food Microbiology, School of Medical Instrument and Food Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, 516 Jungong Road, Shanghai, 200093, People's Republic of China."", ""Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Food Microbiology, School of Medical Instrument and Food Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, 516 Jungong Road, Shanghai, 200093, People's Republic of China."", ""Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Food Microbiology, School of Medical Instrument and Food Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, 516 Jungong Road, Shanghai, 200093, People's Republic of China."", ""Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Food Microbiology, School of Medical Instrument and Food Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, 516 Jungong Road, Shanghai, 200093, People's Republic of China. ailianzhong1@126.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,AMB Express,AMB Express,101561785,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antrodia camphorata', 'Antroquinonol', 'Q-PCR', 'Transcriptome', 'iTRAQ']",2020/08/05 06:00,2020/08/05 06:01,['2020/08/05 06:00'],"['2020/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13568-020-01076-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s13568-020-01076-6 [pii]']",epublish,AMB Express. 2020 Aug 3;10(1):136. doi: 10.1186/s13568-020-01076-6.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6681-9102'],20200803,,,"['31871757/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '19 DZ2281100/Shanghai Engineering Research Center of Food Microbiology']",PMC7399014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 78-year-old man presented an enlargement of the right breast. He had no medical history of interest. On physical examination, a unilateral, painless breast lump was found, with no skin changes or nipple discharge. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Routine laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis and lymphocytosis. Excisional biopsy of the breast lesion revealed mammary tissue infiltration by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with plasmacytoid features and immunoglobulin Gkappa monotypic expression. To our knowledge, this is the first report of male breast involvement by CLL.

In patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), TP53 mutations are associated with high-risk disease(3,4), rapid transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)(5), resistance to conventional therapies(6-8) and dismal outcomes(9). Consistent with the tumor-suppressive role of TP53, patients harbor both mono- and biallelic mutations(10). However, the biological and clinical implications of TP53 allelic state have not been fully investigated in MDS or any other cancer type. We analyzed 3,324 patients with MDS for TP53 mutations and allelic imbalances and delineated two subsets of patients with distinct phenotypes and outcomes. One-third of TP53-mutated patients had monoallelic mutations whereas two-thirds had multiple hits (multi-hit) consistent with biallelic targeting. Established associations with complex karyotype, few co-occurring mutations, high-risk presentation and poor outcomes were specific to multi-hit patients only. TP53 multi-hit state predicted risk of death and leukemic transformation independently of the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R)(11). Surprisingly, monoallelic patients did not differ from TP53 wild-type patients in outcomes and response to therapy. This study shows that consideration of TP53 allelic state is critical for diagnostic and prognostic precision in MDS as well as in future correlative studies of treatment response.","['Bernard, Elsa', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Devlin, Sean M', 'Tuechler, Heinz', 'Medina-Martinez, Juan S', 'Yoshizato, Tetsuichi', 'Shiozawa, Yusuke', 'Saiki, Ryunosuke', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Levine, Max F', 'Arango, Juan E', 'Zhou, Yangyu', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Cargo, Catherine A', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Creignou, Maria', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Gundem, Gunes', 'Sarian, Araxe', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Jadersten, Martin', 'Tobiasson, Magnus', 'Kosmider, Olivier', 'Follo, Matilde Y', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Pinheiro, Ronald F', 'Santini, Valeria', 'Kotsianidis, Ioannis', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Santos, Fabio P S', 'Schanz, Julie', 'Kasahara, Senji', 'Ishikawa, Takayuki', 'Tsurumi, Hisashi', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi', 'Kiguchi, Toru', 'Polprasert, Chantana', 'Bennett, John M', 'Klimek, Virginia M', 'Savona, Michael R', 'Belickova, Monika', 'Ganster, Christina', 'Palomo, Laura', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Della Porta, Matteo Giovanni', 'Elias, Harold K', 'Smith, Alexandra G', 'Werner, Yesenia', 'Patel, Minal', 'Viale, Agnes', 'Vanness, Katelynd', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'Stevenson, Kristen E', 'Menghrajani, Kamal', 'Bolton, Kelly L', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Pellagatti, Andrea', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Valent, Peter', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Finelli, Carlo', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Bejar, Rafael', 'Greenberg, Peter L', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Papaemmanuil, Elli']","['Bernard E', 'Nannya Y', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Devlin SM', 'Tuechler H', 'Medina-Martinez JS', 'Yoshizato T', 'Shiozawa Y', 'Saiki R', 'Malcovati L', 'Levine MF', 'Arango JE', 'Zhou Y', 'Sole F', 'Cargo CA', 'Haase D', 'Creignou M', 'Germing U', 'Zhang Y', 'Gundem G', 'Sarian A', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Jadersten M', 'Tobiasson M', 'Kosmider O', 'Follo MY', 'Thol F', 'Pinheiro RF', 'Santini V', 'Kotsianidis I', 'Boultwood J', 'Santos FPS', 'Schanz J', 'Kasahara S', 'Ishikawa T', 'Tsurumi H', 'Takaori-Kondo A', 'Kiguchi T', 'Polprasert C', 'Bennett JM', 'Klimek VM', 'Savona MR', 'Belickova M', 'Ganster C', 'Palomo L', 'Sanz G', 'Ades L', 'Della Porta MG', 'Elias HK', 'Smith AG', 'Werner Y', 'Patel M', 'Viale A', 'Vanness K', 'Neuberg DS', 'Stevenson KE', 'Menghrajani K', 'Bolton KL', 'Fenaux P', 'Pellagatti A', 'Platzbecker U', 'Heuser M', 'Valent P', 'Chiba S', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Finelli C', 'Voso MT', 'Shih LY', 'Fontenay M', 'Jansen JH', 'Cervera J', 'Atsuta Y', 'Gattermann N', 'Ebert BL', 'Bejar R', 'Greenberg PL', 'Cazzola M', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Ogawa S', 'Papaemmanuil E']","['Computational Oncology Service, Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', ', Vienna, Austria.', 'Computational Oncology Service, Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Hematologic Malignancies, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, IRCCS Fondazione Policlinico S.

While ATL cells in peripheral blood (PB-ATL) are sensitive to anti-CC chemokine receptor 4 treatment, non-PB-ATLs, including lymph node ATLs (LN-ATLs), are more aggressive and resistant. We examined characteristic cytokines and growth factors that allow non-PB-ATLs to proliferate and invade compared with PB-ATLs. Protein array analysis revealed hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2) were significantly upregulated in non-PB-ATLs compared with PB-ATLs. The HGF membrane receptor, c-Met, was expressed in PB-ATL and non-PB-ATL cell lines, but CCR2, a CCL2 receptor, was not. Immunohistochemical analysis in clinical ATLs revealed high HGF expression in LNs, pharynx, bone marrow, and tonsils. The HGF/c-Met signaling pathway was active downstream in non-PB-ATLs. Downregulation of HGF/c-Met by siRNA or chemical inhibitors decreased in vitro and in vivo proliferation and invasion by non-PB-ATLs. Treatment with bromodomain and extra-terminal motif inhibitor suppressed HGF expression and decreased levels of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) binding promoter and enhancer regions, suppressing non-PB-ATL cellular growth. Our data indicate H3K27Ac/BRD4 epigenetics regulates the HGF/c-MET pathway in ATLs; targeting this pathway may improve treatment of aggressive non-PB-ATLs.","['Totani, Haruhito', 'Shinjo, Keiko', 'Suzuki, Miho', 'Katsushima, Keisuke', 'Mase, Shoko', 'Masaki, Ayako', 'Ito, Asahi', 'Ri, Masaki', 'Kusumoto, Shigeru', 'Komatsu, Hirokazu', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Kondo, Yutaka']","['Totani H', 'Shinjo K', 'Suzuki M', 'Katsushima K', 'Mase S', 'Masaki A', 'Ito A', 'Ri M', 'Kusumoto S', 'Komatsu H', 'Ishida T', 'Inagaki H', 'Iida S', 'Kondo Y']","['Division of Cancer Biology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion and Cell Therapy, Nagoya City University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Diagnostics, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Biology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan. ykondo@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (HGF protein, human)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2020/08/05 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2020/08/05 06:00'],"['2020/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-020-01393-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-020-01393-x [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2020 Aug;39(35):5782-5794. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-01393-x.

In this study, we investigated the effects of LW-213 on CTCL cells and the underlying mechanisms. We showed that LW-213 (1-25 muM) dose-dependently inhibited human CTCL cell lines (Hut-102, Hut-78, MyLa, and HH) with IC50 values of around 10 muM, meanwhile it potently inhibited primary leukemia cells derived from peripheral blood of T-cell lymphoma patients. We revealed that LW-213-induced apoptosis was accompanied by ROS formation and the release of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through IP3R-1channel. LW-213 selectively activated CHOP and induced apoptosis in Hut-102 cells via activating PERK-eIF2alpha-ATF4 pathway. Interestingly, the degree of apoptosis and expression of ER stress-related proteins were alleviated in the presence of either N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, or 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB), an IP3R-1 inhibitor, implicating ROS/calcium-dependent ER stress in LW-213-induced apoptosis. In NOD/SCID mice bearing Hut-102 cell line xenografts, administration of LW-213 (10 mg/kg, ip, every other day for 4 weeks) markedly inhibited the growth of Hut-102 derived xenografts and prolonged survival. In conclusion, our study provides a new insight into the mechanism of LW-213-induced apoptosis, suggesting the potential of LW-213 as a promising agent against CTCL.","['Yu, Xiao-Xuan', 'Zhu,

We studied the genomic profile of 52 treatment-naive CLL patients. Methods: Genetic analysis was performed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) using the SALSA P038 Probemix (MRC Holland, Amsterdam), which contains probes for 2p (MYCN,ALK,REL), 6q, 8p (TNFRSF10A/B), 8q (EIF3H,MYC), 9p21 (CDKN2A/B), 10q (PTEN), 11q (ATM, RDX, PPP2R1B, CADM1), chromosome 12, 13q14 (RB1, DLEU1/2/7, KCNRG, MIR15A), 14q, 17p (TP53) and chromosome 19, and for NOTCH1 7541-7542delCT, SF3B1 K700E, and MYD88 L265P mutations. Results: The median age was 65 years (male:female=2:1). The median hemoglobin, total leukocyte, and platelet counts were 12.4 g/dL, 57.7x10(9)/L, and 176.5x10(9)/L, respectively. At least one genetic abnormality was observed in 34 (65%) patients. The most common abnormality was del(13q14) (deleted DLEU2 and DLEU1/RB1 genes), which was observed in 22 (42%) cases, followed by trisomy 12 [7 (13%) cases]. Del(11q) (deleted ATM, RDX11/PPP2R1B-4) and del(17p) (deleted TP53) were present in 5 (10%) and 2 (4%) cases, respectively. 19p13.2 (CDKN2D-2) amplification and NOTCH1 mutation were found in one case each. Conclusion: Genetic abnormalities are commonly (65%) observed in CLL patients. Del(13q), which is associated with DLEU2 and DLEU1/RB1 gene deletion, was the most common. Compared with other abnormalities, del(11q) and del(17p) patients presented with cytopenia and higher Binet stage, while those with del(13q14) had a longer time to first treatment.","['Srinivasan, Vishrut K', 'Naseem, Shano', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Lad, Deepesh P', 'Malhotra, Pankaj']","['Srinivasan VK', 'Naseem S', 'Varma N', 'Lad DP', 'Malhotra P']","['Departments of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Departments of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Departments of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Genetic abnormality', 'Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification']",2020/08/05 06:00,2020/08/05 06:01,['2020/08/05 06:00'],"['2020/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/05 06:01 [medline]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['br.2020.2020080 [pii]', '10.5045/br.2020.2020080 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Res. 2020 Sep 30;55(3):131-138. doi: 10.5045/br.2020.2020080.,,,,,,PMC7536571,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, t(8;21) AML is an excellent model for studying heterogeneous cell populations and cellular evolution during disease progression. Using integrative analyses of immunophenotype, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified three distinct intrapatient leukemic cell populations that were arrested at different stages of myeloid differentiation: CD34(+)CD117(dim) blasts, CD34(+)CD117(bri) blasts, and abnormal myeloid cells with partial maturation (AM). CD117 is also known as c-KIT protein. CD34(+)CD117(dim) cells were blocked in the G0/G1 phase at disease onset, presenting with the regular morphology of myeloblasts showing features of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP), and were drug-resistant to chemotherapy. Genes associated with cell migration and adhesion (LGALS1, EMP3, and ANXA 2) were highly expressed in the CD34(+)CD117(dim) population. CD34(+)CD117(bri) blasts were blocked a bit later than the CD34(+)CD117(dim) population in the hematopoietic differentiation stage and displayed high proliferation ability. AM cells, which bear abnormal myelocyte morphology, especially overexpressed granule genes AZU1, ELANE, and PRTN3 and were sensitive to chemotherapy. scRNA-seq at different time points identified CD34(+)CD117(dim) blasts as an important leukemic cluster that expanded at postrelapse refractory stage after several cycles of chemotherapy. Patients with t(8;21) AML with a higher proportion of CD34(+)CD117(dim) cells had significantly worse clinical outcomes than those with a lower CD34(+)CD117(dim) proportion. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified CD34(+)CD117(dim) proportion as an independent factor for poor disease outcome. Our study provides evidence for the multidimensional heterogeneity of t(8;21)AML and may offer new tools for future disease stratification.","['Jiang, Lu', 'Li, Xue-Ping', 'Dai, Yu-Ting', 'Chen, Bing', 'Weng, Xiang-Qin', 'Xiong, Shu-Min', 'Zhang, Min', 'Huang, Jin-Yan', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Chen, Sai-Juan']","['Jiang L', 'Li XP', 'Dai YT', 'Chen B', 'Weng XQ', 'Xiong SM', 'Zhang M', 'Huang JY', 'Chen Z', 'Chen SJ']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025 Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025 Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025 Shanghai, China.', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200240 Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025 Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025 Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025 Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025 Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025 Shanghai, China; huangjy@sjtu.edu.cn zchen@stn.sh.cn sjchen@stn.sh.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025 Shanghai, China; huangjy@sjtu.edu.cn zchen@stn.sh.cn sjchen@stn.sh.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200240 Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, National Research Center for Translational Medicine, Ruijin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 200025 Shanghai, China; huangjy@sjtu.edu.cn zchen@stn.sh.cn sjchen@stn.sh.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200240 Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Adult', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/metabolism/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*classification/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cellular heterogeneity', '*cellular/clonal evolution', '*gene expression profiling', '*single-cell RNA sequencing', '*t(8;21)(q22;q22) AML']",2020/08/05 06:00,2020/10/07 06:00,['2020/08/05 06:00'],"['2020/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['2003900117 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.2003900117 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Aug 18;117(33):20117-20126. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2003900117.

To model inhibition of mTOR, pre-T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (pre-T LBL) tumor development was monitored in mice with T lymphocyte-specific, constitutively active AKT (Lck-MyrAkt2) that were either crossed to mTOR knockdown (KD) mice or treated with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Lck-MyrAkt2;mTOR KD mice lived significantly longer than Lck-MyrAkt2;mTOR wild-type (WT) mice, although both groups ultimately developed thymic pre-T LBL. An increase in survival was also observed when Lck-MyrAkt2;mTOR WT mice were treated for 8 weeks with everolimus. The transcriptional profiles of WT and KD thymic lymphomas were compared, and Ingenuity Pathway Upstream Regulator Analysis of differentially expressed genes in tumors from mTOR WT versus KD mice identified let-7 and miR-21 as potential regulatory genes. mTOR KD mice had higher levels of let-7a and miR-21 than mTOR WT mice, and rapamycin induced their expression in mTOR WT cells. CDK6 was one of the most downregulated targets of both let-7 and miR21 in mTOR KD tumors. CDK6 overexpression and decreased expression of let-7 in mTOR KD cells rescued a G1 arrest phenotype. Combined mTOR (rapamycin) and CDK4/6 (palbociclib) inhibition decreased tumor size and proliferation in tumor flank transplants, increased survival in an intravenous transplant model of disseminated leukemia compared with single agent treatment, and cooperatively decreased cell viability in human T-ALL/LBL cell lines. Thus, mTOR KD mice provide a model to explore drug combinations synergizing with mTOR inhibitors and can be used to identify downstream targets of inhibition.","['Gary, Joy M', 'Simmons, John K', 'Xu, Jinfei', 'Zhang, Shuling', 'Peat, Tyler J', 'Watson, Nicholas', 'Gamache, Benjamin J', 'Zhang, Ke', 'Kovalchuk, Alexander L', 'Michalowski, Aleksandra M', 'Chen, Jin-Qiu', 'Thaiwong, Tuddow', 'Kiupel, Matti', 'Gaikwad, Snehal', 'Etienne, Maudeline', 'Simpson, R Mark', 'Dubois, Wendy', 'Testa, Joseph R', 'Mock, Beverly A']","['Gary JM', 'Simmons JK', 'Xu J', 'Zhang S', 'Peat TJ', 'Watson N', 'Gamache BJ', 'Zhang K', 'Kovalchuk AL', 'Michalowski AM', 'Chen JQ', 'Thaiwong T', 'Kiupel M', 'Gaikwad S', 'Etienne M', 'Simpson RM', 'Dubois W', 'Testa JR', 'Mock BA']","['Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Cancer Biology Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'American University, Washington, DC.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Immunogenetics, NIAID, NIH, Rockville, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan.', 'Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Cancer Biology Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. mockb@mail.nih.gov joseph.testa@fccc.edu.', 'Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, CCR, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland. mockb@mail.nih.gov joseph.testa@fccc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",,,2020/08/05 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2020/08/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-19-0671 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-19-0671 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2020 Oct;19(10):2221-2232. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-19-0671.

However, treatment-related toxicity with a focus on infectious disease has not been fully reviewed. Several phase 3 trials have demonstrated different rates of febrile neutropenia (FN) between regimens (e.g. dose-adjusted (DA) EPOCH-R vs. R-CHOP). With heterogeneous patient characteristics, a combination regimen of lenalidomide or ibrutinib with R-CHOP exhibited promising efficacy with moderate infectious toxicity. While R-bendamustine is feasible for patients who don't tolerate other forms of chemotherapy, clinical data indicate increased opportunistic infections under prolonged lymphopenia. The usefulness of prophylactic antibiotics/antifungal agents in DLBCL patients is controversial owing to shorter and less severe neutropenia than with the induction regimen for acute leukemia or hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Prophylactic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor is recommended for intensive regimens such as DA-EPOCH-R, R-DHAP, or R-ICE. Regardless of multiple studies about FN incidence, studies focusing on microbiologic events are limited, and further investigations are warranted.","['Ohmoto, Akihiro', 'Fuji, Shigeo']","['Ohmoto A', 'Fuji S']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Cancer Institute Hospital, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo 1358550, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka International Cancer Institute, Osaka 5418567, Japan.

Currently, autologous T cells are conventionally used to manufacture CAR T cells. Low quality or insufficient quantity of autologous T cells may lead to failure of CAR T preparations. Moreover, CAR T preparation usually takes 1-2 weeks, which is too long for patients with rapid disease progression to successfully infuse CAR T cells. Thus, the development of a ready-to-use CAR immunotherapy strategy is needed. NK-92, a natural killer (NK) cell line derived from an NK lymphoma patient, has been gradually applied as a CAR-modified effector cell. To avoid the potential development of secondary NK lymphoma in patients, large doses of radiation are used to treat NK-92 cells before clinical application, which ensures the safety but reduces the cytotoxicity of NK-92 cells. Therefore, it is crucial to explore a suitable radiation dose that ensures short life span and good cytotoxicity of CAR NK-92 cells. METHODS: NK-92MI, a modified IL-2-independent NK-92 cell line, was used to establish an anti-CD19 CAR NK. The suitable radiation dose of CAR NK was then explored in vitro and validated in vivo, and the specific cytotoxicity of irradiated and unirradiated CAR NK against CD19(+) malignant cells was assessed. RESULTS: CAR NK exhibited specific cytotoxicity against CD19(+) malignant cells. Irradiation ensured a short life span of CAR NK in vitro and in vivo. Encouragingly, irradiated CAR NK displayed an anti-CD19(+) malignancy capacity similar to that of unirradiated CAR NK. CONCLUSIONS: Five Gy is a suitable radiation dose to ensure the safety and effectiveness of CD19 CAR NK-92MI cells.","['Liu, Qian', 'Xu, Yingxi', 'Mou, Junli', 'Tang, Kejing', 'Fu, Xuehang', 'Li, Yihui', 'Xing, Yanyan', 'Rao, Qing', 'Xing, Haiyan', 'Tian, Zheng', 'Wang, Min', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Liu Q', 'Xu Y', 'Mou J', 'Tang K', 'Fu X', 'Li Y', 'Xing Y', 'Rao Q', 'Xing H', 'Tian Z', 'Wang M', 'Wang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.

Curative therapy has classically involved the use of intensive induction chemotherapy followed by consolidation with additional chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. For many patients, such an approach is prohibitive because of high treatment-related toxicities. Advancements in the molecular understanding of AML have led to the introduction of new targeted therapies that are changing the treatment landscape for AML. AREAS COVERED: We review emerging small molecule inhibitors that have shown preclinical efficacy for the treatment of AML. The compounds discussed affect apoptosis, p53-mediated interactions, transcriptional regulation, and cellular metabolism. We performed a literature search of PubMed and primarily included relevant sources published from 2000 to the present, though earlier sources are also referenced. EXPERT OPINION: Most clinical trials for AML currently employ novel targeted therapies that demonstrate promising activity in preclinical models. We anticipate that new small molecule inhibitors will continue to enter the clinical realm and alter the treatment paradigm for AML. In a field where clinical advancement was comparatively slow for many years, it appears that we are now starting to see the rapid growth borne out of the deepening molecular understanding of AML.","['Saxena, Kapil', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Saxena K', 'Konopleva M']","['Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Drug Development', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'BCL2 family of proteins', 'apoptosis', 'metabolism', 'small molecule inhibitors']",2020/08/05 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2020/08/05 06:00'],"['2020/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2020.1804856 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2020 Sep;29(9):973-988. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2020.1804856.

The prognosis of CLL patients varies considerably. Transfer RNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs) constitute a class of small non-coding RNA fragments excised from mature tRNAs and pre-tRNAs located in nuclei as well as in mitochondria. In this study, the clinical utility of i-tRF-Phe(GAA), a novel mitochondrial tRF, was investigated in CLL. DESIGN AND METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 91 CLL patients and 43 non-leukemic controls. Total RNA was isolated from each sample, polyadenylated at the 3' end and reversely transcribed. An in-house developed real-time quantitative PCR assay was developed and applied, and the results were biostatistically analyzed. For the normalization of the i-tRF-Phe(GAA) expression levels, the expression of a small nucleolar RNA (RNU48) was used as reference. RESULTS: Mann-Whitney U test showed that i-tRF-Phe(GAA) can distinguish between CLL samples and normal controls (p < 0.001). As determined by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, overexpression of i-tRF-Phe(GAA) was related to poor overall survival of the CLL patients (p < 0.001). Univariate bootstrap Cox regression analysis exhibited a higher hazard ratio of 7.95 (95% CI = 2.37-26.72, p < 0.001) for patients with positive i-tRF-Phe(GAA) expression status. Multivariate bootstrap Cox regression analysis showed that the prognostic value of this tRF is independent of clinical stage, mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) genetic locus, and CD38 expression status (p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that i-tRF-Phe(GAA) can serve as a molecular biomarker of poor prognosis in CLL, alongside with the existing factors for CLL prognosis.","['Karousi, Paraskevi', 'Adamopoulos, Panagiotis G', 'Papageorgiou, Sotirios G', 'Pappa, Vasiliki', 'Scorilas, Andreas', 'Kontos, Christos K']","['Karousi P', 'Adamopoulos PG', 'Papageorgiou SG', 'Pappa V', 'Scorilas A', 'Kontos CK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens GR-15701, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens GR-15701, Greece.', 'Second Department of Internal Medicine and Research Unit, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", 1 Rimini St., Haidari, GR 12462 Athens, Greece.', 'Second Department of Internal Medicine and Research Unit, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", 1 Rimini St., Haidari, GR 12462 Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens GR-15701, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens GR-15701, Greece.

Here, we demonstrate that image-based cytometry yields high-throughput measurements of CAR T cell proliferation and size, and captures the kinetics of in vitro antigen-specific CAR T cell-mediated killing. The data acquired and analyzed by the image cytometer are congruent with results derived from conventional technologies when tested contemporaneously. Moreover, the use of bright-field and fluorescence microscopy by the image cytometer provides kinetic measurements and rapid data acquisition, which are direct advantages over industry standard instruments. Together, image cytometry enables fast, reproducible measurements of CAR T cell manufacturing criteria and effector function, which can greatly facilitate the evaluation of novel CARs with therapeutic potential.","['Maldini, Colby R', 'Love, Andrea C', 'Tosh, Kevin W', 'Chan, Leo Li-Ying', 'Gayout, Kevin', 'Smith, Tim', 'Riley, James L']","['Maldini CR', 'Love AC', 'Tosh KW', 'Chan LL', 'Gayout K', 'Smith T', 'Riley JL']","['Department of Microbiology, Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Technology R&D, Nexcelom Bioscience LLC, Lawrence, MA 01843, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Technology R&D, Nexcelom Bioscience LLC, Lawrence, MA 01843, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Technology R&D, Nexcelom Bioscience LLC, Lawrence, MA 01843, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

In addition to providing fundamental insights into the process of leukemic transformation, these fusion genes provide targets for treatment and monitoring of myeloid leukemias.

Myelodysplastic syndromes occur more frequently in older males and in individuals with prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis of MDS is based on morphological evidence of dysplasia upon visual examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Information obtained from additional studies such as karyotype, flow cytometry and molecular genetics is usually complementary and may help refine diagnosis. RISK-STRATIFICATION: Prognosis of patients with MDS can be calculated using a number of scoring systems. In general, all these scoring systems include analysis of peripheral cytopenias, percentage of blasts in the bone marrow and cytogenetic characteristics. The most commonly accepted system is the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). Somatic mutations can help define prognosis and therapy. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: Therapy is selected based on risk, transfusion needs, percent of bone marrow blasts, cytogenetic and mutational profiles, comorbidities, potential for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) and prior exposure to hypomethylating agents (HMA). Goals of therapy are different in lower-risk patients than in higher-risk individuals and in those with HMA failure. In lower-risk MDS, the goal is to decrease transfusion needs and transformation to higher risk disease or AML, as well as to improve survival. In higher-risk disease, the goal is to prolong survival. In 2020, we witnessed an explosion of new agents and investigational approaches. Current available therapies include growth factor support, lenalidomide, HMAs, intensive chemotherapy and alloSCT. Novel therapeutics approved in 2020 are luspatercept and the oral HMA ASTX727. At the present time, there are no approved interventions for patients with progressive or refractory disease particularly after HMA-based therapy. Options include participation in a clinical trial, cytarabine-based therapy or alloSCT.","['Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Chien, Kelly S', 'Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo']","['Garcia-Manero G', 'Chien KS', 'Montalban-Bravo G']","['Section of MDS, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Section of MDS, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Section of MDS, Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Allografts', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Risk Assessment', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate']",,,2020/08/04 06:00,2020/12/30 06:00,['2020/08/04 06:00'],"['2020/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25950 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Nov;95(11):1399-1420. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25950.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6024-1613', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4533-5176']",,,['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The acute and lymphoma subtypes are regarded as aggressive ATLLs, and the overall survival (OS) of patients remains poor. Transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing protein 3 (TACC3) regulates microtubules, which are associated with cancer-related proteins overexpressed in various cancers. Such a relationship has not been reported in hematopoietic tumors, including ATLL. METHODS: We examined tissue microarrays of histological samples from 92 cases of aggressive ATLL and assessed clinical features, including TACC3 protein expression levels. RESULTS: Compared with TACC3-low, TACC3-high ATLL patients were significantly older (P < .001), with a tendency toward pleomorphic variant over other morphological classifications (P = .019). TACC3-high patients (median survival time [MST] 10.6 months, confidence interval [CI] [6.27-15.6]) had poorer OS compared to TACC3-low patients (MST 20 months, CI [9.43-38.5]) (P = .0168). Moreover, multivariate analysis on TACC3 expression levels suggests that TACC3-high is an independent significant prognostic factor (HR, 1.700; 95% CI, 1.037-2.753; P = .0355). CONCLUSION: Certain drugs that inhibit TACC3-overexpressing neoplastic cells are used clinically. Further studies might highlight a key role for TACC3 in the oncogenesis and progression of ATLL.","['Moritsubo, Mayuko', 'Miyoshi, Hiroaki', 'Matsuda, Kotaro', 'Yoshida, Noriaki', 'Nakashima, Kazutaka', 'Yanagida, Eriko', 'Yamada, Kyohei', 'Takeuchi, Mai', 'Suzuki, Takaharu', 'Muta, Hiroko', 'Umeno, Takeshi', 'Furuta, Takuya', 'Seto, Masao', 'Ohshima, Koichi']","['Moritsubo M', 'Miyoshi H', 'Matsuda K', 'Yoshida N', 'Nakashima K', 'Yanagida E', 'Yamada K', 'Takeuchi M', 'Suzuki T', 'Muta H', 'Umeno T', 'Furuta T', 'Seto M', 'Ohshima K']","['Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopedic surgery, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Studies, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of medicine, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TACC3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['ATLL', 'TACC3', 'hematology', 'pathology', 'prognosis']",2020/08/04 06:00,2021/02/04 06:00,['2020/08/04 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13289 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2020 Dec;42(6):842-848. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13289.

Objective: To describe expanding neurologic phenotype, cancer associations, outcomes, and immunopathologic features of KLHL11 encephalitis. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective tertiary care center study, conducted from October 15, 1998, to November 1, 2019, prospectively identified 31 KLHL11 IgG+ cases in the neuroimmunology laboratory. Eight were identified by retrospective testing of patients with rhomboencephalitis (confirmed by tissue-based-immunofluorescence and transfected-cell-based assays). Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcome variables included modified Rankin score and gait aid use. Results: All 39 KLHL11 IgG+ patients were men (median age, 46 years; range, 28-73 years). Initial clinical presentations were ataxia (n = 32; 82%), diplopia (n = 22; 56%), vertigo (n = 21; 54%), hearing loss (n = 15; 39%), tinnitus (n = 14; 36%), dysarthria (n = 11; 28%), and seizures (n = 9; 23%). Atypical neurologic presentations included neuropsychiatric dysfunction, myeloneuropathy, and cervical amyotrophy. Hearing loss or tinnitus preceded other neurologic deficits by 1 to 8 months in 10 patients (26%). Among patients screened for malignancy (n = 36), testicular germ-cell tumors (n = 23; 64%) or testicular microlithiasis and fibrosis concerning for regressed germ cell tumor (n = 7; 19%) were found in 83% of the patients (n = 30). In 2 patients, lymph node biopsy diagnosed metastatic lung adenocarcinoma in one and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the other. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed T2 hyperintensities in the temporal lobe (n = 12), cerebellum (n = 9), brainstem (n = 3), or diencephalon (n = 3). Among KLHL11 IgG+ patients who underwent HLA class I and class II genotyping (n = 10), most were found to have HLA-DQB1*02:01 (n = 7; 70%) and HLA-DRB1*03:01 (n = 6; 60%) associations. A biopsied gadolinium-enhancing temporal lobe lesion demonstrated T cell-predominant inflammation and nonnecrotizing granulomas. Cerebellar biopsy (patient with chronic ataxia) and 2 autopsied brains demonstrated Purkinje neuronal loss and Bergmann gliosis, supporting early active inflammation and later extensive neuronal loss. Compared with nonautoimmune control peripheral blood mononuclear cells, cluster of differentiation (CD) 8+ and CD4+ T cells were significantly activated when patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with KLHL11 protein. Most patients (58%) benefitted from immunotherapy and/or cancer treatment (neurological disability stabilized [n = 10] or improved [n = 9]). Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrated significantly higher probability of wheelchair dependence among patients without detectable testicular cancer. Long-term outcomes in KLHL11-IgG+ patients were similar to Ma2 encephalitis. Conclusions and Relevance: Kelch-like protein-11 IgG is a biomarker of testicular germ-cell tumor and paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome, often refractory to treatment. Described expanded neurologic phenotype and paraclinical findings may aid in its early diagnosis and treatment.","['Dubey, Divyanshu', 'Wilson, Michael R', 'Clarkson, Benjamin', 'Giannini, Caterina',

It has a strong genetic basis, showing a ~ 8-fold increased risk of CLL in first-degree relatives. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 41 risk variants across 41 loci. However, for a majority of the loci, the functional variants and the mechanisms underlying their causal roles remain undefined. Here, we examined the genetic and epigenetic features associated with 12 index variants, along with any correlated (r2 >/= 0.5) variants, at the CLL risk loci located outside of gene promoters. Based on publicly available ChIP-seq and chromatin accessibility data as well as our own ChIP-seq data from CLL patients, we identified six candidate functional variants at six loci and at least two candidate functional variants at each of the remaining six loci. The functional variants are predominantly located within enhancers or super-enhancers, including bi-directionally transcribed enhancers, which are often restricted to immune cell types. Furthermore, we found that, at 78% of the functional variants, the alternative alleles altered the transcription factor binding motifs or histone modifications, indicating the involvement of these variants in the change of local chromatin state. Finally, the enhancers carrying functional variants physically interacted with genes enriched in the type I interferon signaling pathway, apoptosis, or TP53 network that are known to play key roles in CLL. These results support the regulatory roles for inherited noncoding variants in the pathogenesis of CLL.","['Yan, Huihuang', 'Tian, Shulan', 'Kleinstern, Geffen', 'Wang, Zhiquan', 'Lee, Jeong-Heon', 'Boddicker, Nicholas J', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Braggio, Esteban', 'Slager, Susan L']","['Yan H', 'Tian S', 'Kleinstern G', 'Wang Z', 'Lee JH', 'Boddicker NJ', 'Cerhan JR', 'Kay NE', 'Braggio E', 'Slager SL']","['Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ 85259, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",,,2020/08/04 06:00,2021/08/28 06:00,['2020/08/04 06:00'],"['2020/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['5879699 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddaa165 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2020 Sep 29;29(16):2761-2774. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddaa165.,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

As central nervous system (CNS) involvement requires an intensified CNS-targeted therapy, timely diagnosis is essential. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate whether cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations findings correlate with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis on CNS involvement and whether MRI examinations reveal incidental findings with a clinical consequence. METHODS: All pediatric patients with ALL at our institution between 1998 and 2016 were identified. Patients were divided into two groups: de novo and relapsed ALL. Both groups were analyzed separately for the presence of CNS involvement. Incidental findings were also evaluated. RESULTS: Two hundred fifteen patients with de novo ALL and 31 with relapsed ALL were identified. In the de novo group, no patient was diagnosed CNS positive based on MRI results alone. In relapsed patients, only one patient had a positive MRI with negative CSF results and no neurological symptoms, thus was classified CNS positive solely on the basis of the MRI. In both groups, no patient showed an incidental finding that required therapy. CONCLUSION: In our study, MRI examinations do not improve the detection of CNS involvement compared with CSF analysis alone.

However, its role in myeloid malignancies including AML needs to be highlighted. So, this prospective cohort study aimed to assess the effect of AMC on the treatment outcome and survival in a 56 adult de novo AML patients with monocytic differentiation, admitted to the Clinical Hematology Unit, Internal Medicine Department, in a tertiary referral hospital in Egypt, from July 2016 to June 2019. RESULTS: The initial AMC was measured either by manual differential or the hematology automatic analyzer Sysmex XN-2000 and patients were classified by using receiver operating characteristic curve into two groups monocytopenic (</= 4 x 10(9)/L) and non-monocytopenic (> 4 x 10(9)/L) group; including 24 (42.9%) and 32 (57.1%) patients, respectively. After a median follow up period of 7.7 (range 0.5-33.2) months, the monocytopenic group was associated with a significantly higher CR rate (P = 0.019), with a lower death as well as relapse and early relapse rates (P = 0.011, 0.033, and 0.002, respectively). Moreover, low initial AMC along with intensive induction were independently associated with complete response to induction chemotherapy with HR, 5.04 [1.37-18.58], P = 0.015, and 5.67 [1.48-21.71], P = 0.011, respectively by using the multivariate logistic regression model. Regarding survival, the monocytopenic group was associated with a better 3-year disease-free survival rate (P = 0.011) in univariate Cox regression only but did not reach significance in the multivariate model and did not affect the overall survival as well. CONCLUSION: Initial AMC was found to be an independent prognostic immune biomarker for treatment response in AML patients with monocytic differentiation. However, it did not appear as an independent predictor of survival in a multivariate analysis.","['Embaby, Ahmed', 'Fathy, Ayman', 'Al-Akkad, Mohammad', 'Baraka, Ahmad', 'Ibrahim, Taiseer', 'Zidan, Nahla', 'Refaat, Mohamed', 'Elsheikh, Haitham']","['Embaby A', 'Fathy A', 'Al-Akkad M', 'Baraka A', 'Ibrahim T', 'Zidan N', 'Refaat M', 'Elsheikh H']","['Clinical Hematology Unit, Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Al-Sharika, 44519, Egypt.

Considering that transporters and glomerular filtration influence, to different extents, the drug disposition, and possible side effects, we evaluated the effects of ALL on major renal transporters and glomerular filtration mediated pharmacokinetic changes, as well as expression of renal drug transporters. METHODS: ALL xenograft models were established and intravenously injected with substrates of renal transporters and glomerular filtration separately in NOD/SCID mice. The plasma concentrations of substrates, after single doses, were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). RESULTS: With the development of ALL, protein expression of MDR1, OAT3 and OCT2 were increased by 2.62-fold, 1.70-fold, and 1.45-fold, respectively, whereas expression of MRP2 and MRP4 were significantly decreased by 30.98% and 45.28% in the kidney of ALL groups compared with control groups. Clearance of MDR1-mediated digoxin, OAT3-mediated furosemide, and OCT2-mediated metformin increased by 3.04-fold, 1.47-fold, and 1.26-fold, respectively. However, clearance of MRPs-mediated methotrexate was reduced by 39.5%. These results are consistent with mRNA expression. Clearance of vancomycin and amikacin, as markers of glomerular filtration rate, had a 2.14 and 1.64-fold increase in ALL mice, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The specific alteration of renal transporters and glomerular filtration in kidneys provide a rational explanation for changes in pharmacokinetics for ALL.","['Zhou, Yue', 'Du, Bin', 'Kan, Min', 'Chen, Shang', 'Tang, Bo-Hao', 'Nie, Ai-Qing', 'Ye, Pan-Pan', 'Shi, Hai-Yan', 'Hao, Guo-Xiang', 'Guo, Xiu-Li', 'Han, Qiu-Ju', 'Zheng, Yi', 'Zhao, Wei']","['Zhou Y', 'Du B', 'Kan M', 'Chen S', 'Tang BH', 'Nie AQ', 'Ye PP', 'Shi HY', 'Hao GX', 'Guo XL', 'Han QJ', 'Zheng Y', 'Zhao W']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Institute of Biochemical and Biotechnological Drug, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Institute of Immunopharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China. zhengyi@sdu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cheeloo College of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, China. zhao4wei2@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, China. zhao4wei2@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 2)', '73K4184T59 (Digoxin)', '7LXU5N7ZO5 (Furosemide)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Digoxin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Furosemide/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Metformin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent/genetics/metabolism', 'Organic Cation Transporter 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Renal Elimination/*physiology', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'clearance', 'glomerular filtration', 'renal transporters']",2020/08/04 06:00,2020/12/18 06:00,['2020/08/04 06:00'],"['2020/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11095-020-02896-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s11095-020-02896-8 [pii]']",epublish,Pharm Res. 2020 Aug 2;37(8):158. doi: 10.1007/s11095-020-02896-8.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1830-338X'],20200802,,,"['2017ZX09304029-002/National Science and Technology Major Projects', '81703603/National Science Foundation of China']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Richter syndrome is characterized by rapidly growing lymphadenopathy but rarely presents with extra-nodal involvement, common sites being the digestive tract, lungs, kidneys, and central nervous system. However, Richter syndrome with testicular involvement is extremely rare. Case presentation: Herein we report a very scare case of a male at the age of 72 with Richter syndrome and testicular involvement, diagnosed by the investigation of bilateral scrotal swellings. The patient had attained disease-free survival for over a year with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, and the intrathecal administration of chemotherapeutic agents after diagnosis by immediate orchiectomy. Conclusion: An early pathological diagnosis by immediate orchiectomy and the early initiation of induction immunochemotherapy may be good prognostic factors in Richter syndrome involving the testes.","['Kawase, Kengo', 'Naiki, Taku', 'Naiki-Ito, Aya', 'Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Ikegami, Yosuke', 'Ota, Yuya', 'Hattori, Tatsuya', 'Matsuyama, Nayuka', 'Hamakawa, Takashi', 'Maruyama, Tetsuji', 'Yasui, Takahiro']","['Kawase K', 'Naiki T', 'Naiki-Ito A', 'Yanada M', 'Ikegami Y', 'Ota Y', 'Hattori T', 'Matsuyama N', 'Hamakawa T', 'Maruyama T', 'Yasui T']","['Department of Nephro-Urology Graduate School of Medical Sciences Nagoya City University Nagoya Aichi Japan.', 'Department of Urology Nagoya City East Medical Center Nagoya Aichi Japan.', 'Department of Nephro-Urology Graduate School of Medical Sciences Nagoya City University Nagoya Aichi Japan.', 'Pathology Division Nagoya City East Medical Center Nagoya Aichi Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy Aichi Cancer Center Nagoya Aichi Japan.', 'Department of Urology Nagoya City East Medical Center Nagoya Aichi Japan.', 'Department of Nephro-Urology Graduate School of Medical Sciences Nagoya City University Nagoya Aichi Japan.', 'Department of Urology Nagoya City East Medical Center Nagoya Aichi Japan.', 'Department of Urology Nagoya City East Medical Center Nagoya Aichi Japan.', 'Department of Urology Nagoya City East Medical Center Nagoya Aichi Japan.', 'Department of Urology Nagoya City East Medical Center Nagoya Aichi Japan.', 'Department of Urology Nagoya City East Medical Center Nagoya Aichi Japan.', 'Department of Nephro-Urology Graduate School of Medical Sciences Nagoya City University Nagoya Aichi Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],Australia,IJU Case Rep,IJU case reports,101764958,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL/SLL', 'Richter syndrome', 'diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'testicular germ cell tumor']",2019/06/17 00:00,2019/06/17 00:01,['2020/08/04 06:00'],"['2019/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/17 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/iju5.12096 [doi]', 'IJU512096 [pii]']",epublish,IJU Case Rep. 2019 Jun 17;2(4):232-235. doi: 10.1002/iju5.12096. eCollection 2019 Jul.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7638-6048'],20190617,,"['(c) 2019 The Authors.

In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pembrolizumab has demonstrated significant efficacy, significant survival outcomes, long-lasting responses, and a good safety profile compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 79-year-old Korean male presented with a left side palpable neck mass. An ultrasound-guided core-needle biopsy of the largest neck mass was performed, and squamous cell carcinoma was confirmed based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings. He was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with multiple lymph nodes and rib metastases (T1N3M1b, Stage IVA) using enhanced chest computed tomography and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission/computed tomography. After 4 cycles of gemcitabine and carboplatin, we clinically judged the disease as progressive. Owing to the high PD-1 expression demonstrated by the patient, pembrolizumab was initiated (200 mg every 3 wk). After 3 cycles of pembrolizumab, a complete response was achieved. At the 4(th) cycle of pembrolizumab, the white blood cell count was markedly elevated. Peripheral blood smear analysis and bone marrow biopsy were performed. The patient was diagnosed with acute myelomonocytic leukemia. CONCLUSION: We present the first report of acute myelomonocytic leukemia during pembrolizumab treatment in an NSCLC patient; the mechanism remains unknown.","['Kim, Hong-Beum', 'Park, Sang-Gon', 'Hong, Ran', 'Kang, Seong-Ho', 'Na, Yong Sub']","['Kim HB', 'Park SG', 'Hong R', 'Kang SH', 'Na YS']","['Department of Premedical Course, Chosun University School of Medicine, Gwangju 61452, South Korea.', 'Department of Hemato-oncology, Chosun University Hospital, Gwangju 61453, South Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Chosun University Hospital, Gwangju 61453, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chosun University Hospital, Gwangju 61453, South Korea.', 'Department of Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine, Chosun University Hospital, Gwangju 61453, South Korea. ebusters@chosun.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],United States,World J Clin Cases,World journal of clinical cases,101618806,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Adverse events', 'Case report', 'Immunotherapy', 'Non-small cell lung cancer']",2020/08/04 06:00,2020/08/04 06:01,['2020/08/04 06:00'],"['2020/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12998/wjcc.v8.i13.2833 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Clin Cases. 2020 Jul 6;8(13):2833-2840. doi: 10.12998/wjcc.v8.i13.2833.,,,,"['(c)The Author(s) 2020.

The B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family proteins play a key role in regulating intrinsic apoptosis and, in many cancers, are the main culprits behind tumor survival and therapy resistance. Hence, the role of BCL-2 inhibitors is very beneficial in the treatment of CLL. Venetoclax is the first selective, orally bioavailable BCL-2 inhibitor. This review article discusses factors such as the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, acquired resistance to venetoclax, responders vs. non-responders in venetoclax monotherapy, and the synergistic role of venetoclax with other drugs in detail. Venetoclax is the first BH3 mimetic drug and selective BCL-2 inhibitor that has received FDA approval.

Earlier, expression of acid-sensing ion channels, ASIC1a, was demonstrated in the chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells. Three-finger toxins from the black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) venom, mambalgins, have been shown to efficiently inhibit homo- and heteromeric channels containing the ASIC1a subunit; however, their use as possible antitumor agents had not been examined. In this work, using the patch-clamp technique, we detected, for the first time, an activation of ASIC1a channels in the leukemia K562 cells in response to an extracellular pH decrease. Recombinant mambalgin-2 was shown to inhibit ASIC1a activity and suppress the proliferation of the K562 cells with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) ~ 0.2 muM. Maximum mambalgin-2 inhibitory effect is achieved after 72 h of incubation with cells and when the pH of the cell medium reaches ~ 6.6. In the K562 cells, mambalgin-2 caused arrest of the cell cycle in the G1 phase and reduced the phosphorylation of G1 cell cycle phase regulators: cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4, without affecting the activity of CDK6 kinase. Thus, recombinant mambalgin-2 can be considered a prototype of a new type of drugs for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Bychkov, M L', 'Shulepko, M A', 'Vasileva, V Y', 'Sudarikova, A V', 'Kirpichnikov, M P', 'Lyukmanova, E N']","['Bychkov ML', 'Shulepko MA', 'Vasileva VY', 'Sudarikova AV', 'Kirpichnikov MP', 'Lyukmanova EN']","['Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 117997 Russia.', 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 117997 Russia.', 'Institute of Cytology RAS, St-Petersburg, 194064 Russia.', 'Institute of Cytology RAS, St-Petersburg, 194064 Russia.', 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 117997 Russia.', 'Biological Faculty of Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, 119992 Russia.', 'Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 117997 Russia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Russia (Federation),Acta Naturae,Acta naturae,101525823,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ly6/uPAR', 'acid-sensing ion channels', 'cell cycle', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'three-finger proteins']",2020/08/04 06:00,2020/08/04 06:01,['2020/08/04 06:00'],"['2020/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.32607/actanaturae.10949 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Naturae. 2020 Apr-Jun;12(2):101-116. doi: 10.32607/actanaturae.10949.,,,,['Copyright (R) 2020 National Research University Higher School of Economics.'],,PMC7385094,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In search for novel chemotherapeutics against ATLL, we investigated the combinatorial effects of parthenolide, a sesquiterpene lactone with valuable pharmaceutical activities, and arsenic trioxide (ATO) in vitro. Materials and Methods: MT2 cells, an ATLL cell line, were treated with increasing concentrations of parthenolide (1.25, 2.5, and 5 mug/ml) and ATO (2, 4, 8, and 16 microM) to determine their IC50. Then, cells were treated with a combination of sub-IC50 concentrations of parthenolide (1 mug/ml) and ATO (2 microM) for 72 hr. Cell viability and cell cycle changes were assessed by Alamar blue and PI staining, respectively. To understand the mechanisms responsible for observed effects, expression of CD44, NF-kappaB (REL-A), BMI-1, and C-MYC were investigated by real-time PCR. Results: Assessment of cell viability indicated that parthenolide significantly increased the toxicity of ATO, as confirmed by accumulation of MT2 cells in the sub G1 phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, molecular analysis revealed significant down-regulation of CD44, NF-kappaB (REL-A), BMI-1, and C-MYC upon combinatorial administration of parthenolide and ATO in comparison with relevant controls. Conclusion: Taken together, present results showed that parthenolide significantly enhanced the toxicity of ATO in MT2 cells. Therefore, the future possible clinical impact of our study could be combinatorial use of parthenolide and ATO as a novel and more effective approach for ATLL.","['Kouhpaikar, Hamideh', 'Sadeghian, Mohammad Hadi', 'Rafatpanah, Houshang', 'Kazemi, Mohaddeseh', 'Iranshahi, Mehrdad', 'Delbari, Zahra', 'Khodadadi, Faezeh', 'Ayatollahi, Hossein', 'Rassouli, Fatemeh B']","['Kouhpaikar H', 'Sadeghian MH', 'Rafatpanah H', 'Kazemi M', 'Iranshahi M', 'Delbari Z', 'Khodadadi F', 'Ayatollahi H', 'Rassouli FB']","['Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Department of Hematology and Blood Bank, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Department of Hematology and Blood Bank, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy and Biotechnology, Biotechnology Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Department of Hematology and Blood Bank, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Department of Hematology and Blood Bank, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Novel Diagnostics and Therapeutics Research Group, Institute of Biotechnology, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran J Basic Med Sci,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,101517966,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell', 'Arsenic trioxide', 'In vitro', 'Leukemia/Lymphoma', 'PCR', 'Parthenolide']",2020/08/04 06:00,2020/08/04 06:01,['2020/08/04 06:00'],"['2020/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22038/ijbms.2020.40650.9610 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran J Basic Med Sci. 2020 May;23(5):616-622. doi: 10.22038/ijbms.2020.40650.9610.,,,,,,PMC7374994,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the evidence regarding the optimal conditioning intensity in younger patients with AML or MDS is weak and contradictory. Methods: PubMed, Medline, Embase, and other online sources were searched from the initial period to February 25, 2020. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to estimate pooling effects. Results: Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about conditioning intensity involving 633 patients were included. There were no significant differences of 1/2/4/5 years progression-free survival (PFS) and relapse incidence (RI) between two conditioning intensities. Overall survival (OS) was similar at 1/2/4 years, but patients receiving RIC had a higher OS at 5 years. Additionally, RIC were associated with lower non-relapse mortality, less grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and lower incidence of chronic GVHD compared with MAC regimens. Subgroup analysis showed similar OS and RI for AML patients, and there was a trend towards lower NRM and grade II-IV aGVHD in RIC group. Available data for MDS indicated that OS, PFS, and RI were comparable. For intermediate-risk patients, there was no evidence that RIC is inferior to MAC. However, for high-risk patients, MAC tends to perform better. Conclusions: Based on the above results, it might be concluded that RIC is a feasible treatment option for adults with AML or MDS younger than 66 years, particularly those with intermediate-risk disease. Future RCTs incorporating of risk stratifications are warranted to guide the optimal decision under certain conditions.","['Ma, Shengling', 'Shi, Wei', 'Li, Ziying', 'Tang, Liang', 'Wang, Huafang', 'Xia, Linghui', 'Hu, Yu']","['Ma S', 'Shi W', 'Li Z', 'Tang L', 'Wang H', 'Xia L', 'Hu Y']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'myeloablative', 'stem cell']",2020/08/04 06:00,2020/08/04 06:01,['2020/08/04 06:00'],"['2020/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.46081 [doi]', 'jcav11p5223 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2020 Jul 6;11(17):5223-5235. doi: 10.7150/jca.46081. eCollection 2020.,,20200706,,['(c) The author(s).'],,PMC7378925,,,"['Competing Interests: We declare that we have no financial and personal', 'relationships with other people or organizations that can inappropriately', 'influence our work, there is no professional or other personal interest of any', 'nature or kind in any product, service and/or company that could be construed as', 'influencing the position presented in, or the review of, the manuscript entitled,', '""Reduced-intensity versus myeloablative conditioning regimens for younger adults', 'with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome: a systematic review and', 'meta-analysis"".']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the present study aimed to determine the association between ACTL10 expression levels, DNA methylation levels and the clinical prognosis in cytogenic normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). Data from seventy-five patients with CN-AML and patients with AML treated with chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and were used to analyze the clinical prognosis of ACTL10 RNA expression levels and DNA methylation levels. In addition, the study also investigated the combined clinical prognosis of ACTL10 RNA expression levels and ACTL10 DNA methylation levels in 74 patients with CN-AML from the TCGA dataset. ACTL10 RNA expression levels were observed to be highly expressed in patients with CD34(+)/CD38(+) AML (P<0.01). Both ACTL10 RNA expression levels and DNA methylation were found to be independent prognostic factors for patients with CN-AML; patients with CN-AML in the ACTL10 RNA-high expression group had an increased EFS (P=0.0016) and OS (P=0.014) and patients in ACTL10 DNA methylation-low group also demonstrated a long EFS (P<0.0001) and OS (P=0.004). Notably, integrating ACTL10 RNA expression levels and ACTL10 DNA methylation levels could more accurately predict the prognosis of patients with CN-AML (EFS and OS, P<0.0001).

A survival package was used to screen prognosis-associated lncRNAs and clinical factors. The optimal lncRNA combination was selected using the penalized package, and the risk-score system was built and evaluated. After the lncRNA-mRNA expression correlation network was constructed, the potential pathways involving the key lncRNAs were enriched using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Among the 61 DE-lncRNAs, 48 lncRNAs were significantly associated with prognosis. Relapse was an independent prognostic factor. The optimal 14-lncRNA risk score system was constructed. After 730 differentially expressed mRNAs were identified between the good and bad prognosis groups divided using a prognostic index, the lncRNA-mRNA expression correlation network was constructed.

It was found that apigenin inhibited proliferation, hindered cell cycle progression and promoted SKOV3 cell apoptosis. Moreover, these effects were also observed in cisplatin-resistant SKOV3/DDP cells. Furthermore, apigenin reduced the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and elevated the ratios of cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 in the two cell types. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting results demonstrated that apigenin significantly downregulated Mcl-1 at the transcriptional and translational levels in SKOV3 and SKOV3/DDP cells, which was responsible for its cytotoxic functions and chemosensitizing effects. Collectively, the present results identified the impact of apigenin on OC cell death and resistance to cisplatin, and the potential molecular mechanisms.

The expression of miR-425 was determined in the B lymphocytes of CLL patients and in normal B lymphocytes by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In addition, MEC-1 cells transfected with miR-425 negative control (NC) or miR-425 mimic were examined. The cell proliferation of different groups was evaluated using an MTT assay, and cell cycle distribution was evaluated using flow cytometry analysis. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to verify whether Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) was a target of miR-425. Furthermore, the expression levels of BTK, phospholipase Cgamma2 (PLCgamma2), Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were determined by RT-qPCR and western blotting. The results revealed that the expression of miR-425 was significantly downregulated in B lymphocytes obtained from CLL patients as compared with that in normal B lymphocytes. When cells were transfected with miR-425 mimic, the proliferation of MEC-1 cells was significantly inhibited at 24, 48 and 72 h compared with the proliferation of control cells. Additionally, the ratio of G0/G1 cells was significantly increased and the ratio of G2/M cells was significantly decreased in miR-425-overexpressing cells compared with that in control cells. The luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-425 binds to the 3'-untranslated region of BTK mRNA. Finally, BTK, PLCgamma2, Ki-67 and PCNA expression was significantly inhibited at the mRNA and protein level in cells where miR-425 was upregulated. In conclusion, miR-425 inhibits the proliferation of MEC-1 cells, potentially by inhibiting BTK/PLCgamma2 signalling, and Ki-67 and PCNA expression levels. These results provide a deeper insight for understanding the development of CLL and suggest a potential novel target for the treatment of CLL patients.","['Chen, Jianying', 'Li, Yuhua', 'Xie, Xiaoling']","['Chen J', 'Li Y', 'Xie X']","[""Department of Rheumatology, Hunan Provincial People's Hospital, Changsha, Hunan 410012, P.R.

Chronic inflammation, as several autoimmune disorders are co-associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report here an 84-year-old male patient with swelling lump on the upper third of the left arm. Previously he suffered from a type I chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Based on the initial ultrasound-guided biopsy of the lesion, the histopathological examination revealed an atypical fibroxanthoma. A wide local excision was performed and the diagnosis was revised to pleomorphic dermal sarcoma by the pathologist, based on the currently accepted criteria. Adjuvant radiotherapy was performed. CONCLUSION: Differentiating between atypical fibroxanthoma and pleomorphic dermal sarcoma is pivotal. A partial sampling of the skin lesion poses a significant pitfall, as important diagnostic features cannot be assessed. Immunosuppression seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and pleomorphic dermal sarcomas, because of the advanced patient age.

However, entry of liposomes into the brain parenchyma was limited in the early stages after I/R possibly due to microvascular dysfunction induced by pathological progression. As such, new approaches to overcome the BBB are needed. Leukocytes can pass through inflamed BBB in I/R region due to membrane proteins displayed on their surface. We thus hypothesized that incorporation of leukocyte membrane proteins onto liposomal membranes would impart leukocyte-mimicking functions to liposomes and that leukocyte-mimetic liposomes (LM-Lipo) may pass through inflamed endothelial cells and BBB, similar to leukocytes. LM-Lipo prepared using intermembrane protein transfer from human leukemia cells showed significantly increased association to inflamed human umbilical vein endothelial cells relative to plain liposomes. Moreover, LM-Lipo passed through inflamed endothelial cell layer by regulating intercellular junctions. These results suggest that imparting leukocyte-like properties to liposomes via intermembrane protein transfer would be an effective strategy to overcome inflamed endothelial barriers. In this review, we describe our findings on ischemic stroke treatment using liposomal DDS and the potential of LM-Lipo to overcome inflamed endothelial barriers.","['Fukuta, Tatsuya', 'Kogure, Kentaro']","['Fukuta T', 'Kogure K']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Health Chemistry, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Health Chemistry, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Tokushima University.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,"['0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)']",IM,"['Blood-Brain Barrier/*metabolism', '*Drug Delivery Systems', '*Drug Development', 'Humans', '*Leukocytes', 'Liposomes/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Permeability', 'Protein Transport', 'Reperfusion Injury/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Stroke/*drug therapy/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['blood-brain barrier (BBB)', 'cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury', 'inflamed endothelial cell', 'intermembrane protein transfer', 'leukocyte', 'liposome']",2020/08/04 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2020/08/04 06:00'],"['2020/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1248/yakushi.20-00012-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 2020;140(8):1007-1012. doi: 10.1248/yakushi.20-00012-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RUNXs dysregulations caused by aberrant expression or mutation are frequently seen in various human cancers especially in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). OBJECTIVE: We systemically analyzed the expression of RUNXs and their relationship with clinic-pathological features and prognosis in AML patients. METHODS: Expression of RUNXs was analyzed between AML patients and normal controls from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) projects. Correlations between RUNXs expression and clinical features together with survival were further analyzed. RESULTS: All RUNXs expression in AML patients was significantly increased as compared with controls. RUNXs expression was found to be significantly associated with genetic abnormalities such as RUNX1 mutation, t(8;21) and inv(16)/t(16;16). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, only RUNX3 overexpression was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) among non-M3 AML patients. Notably, in high RUNX3 expression groups, patients received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) had markedly better OS and DFS than patients without HSCT among both all AML and non-M3 AML. In low RUNX3 expression groups, there were no significant differences in OS and DFS between HSCT and non-HSCT groups among both all AML and non-M3 AML. In addition, a total of 835 differentially expressed genes and 69 differentially expressed microRNAs were identified to be correlated with RUNX3 expression in AML. CONCLUSION: RUNXs overexpression was a frequent event in AML, and was closely associated with diverse genetic alterations. Moreover, RUNX3 expression may be associated with clinical outcome, and helpful for guiding treatment choice between HSCT and chemotherapy in AML.","['Zhao, Yangli', 'Zhang, Tingjuan', 'Zhao, Yangjing', 'Zhou, Jingdong']","['Zhao Y', 'Zhang T', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhou J']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'Department of Bioinformatics, School of Biomedical Engineering and Informatics, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Zhenjiang Medical School, Nanjing Medical University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'Zhenjiang Medical School, Nanjing Medical University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', 'Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment in Hematologic Malignancies of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'Department of Immunology, Key Laboratory of Medical Science and Laboratory Medicine of Jiangsu Province, School of Medicine, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."", 'Zhenjiang Medical School, Nanjing Medical University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', 'Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.', 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment in Hematologic Malignancies of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['RUNX', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'biomarker', 'expression', 'prognosis']",2020/08/04 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2020/08/04 06:00'],"['2020/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['CBM200016 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-200016 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2020;29(3):387-397. doi: 10.3233/CBM-200016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main challenge is to overcome disease resistance to achieve a new complete remission while avoiding excessive toxicity. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), a conjugate of calicheamicin linked to the humanized monoclonal anti-CD33 antibody, has been used for refractory or relapsed AML with promising response rates, but liver toxicity of GO has long been considered a limiting factor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 18 consecutive patients with AML relapsing after a first allo-HCT and treated with fractioned GO (fGO) and intensive chemotherapy. The median age was 40 years (range, 18-65). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 72% (13/18), including 7 complete remissions. No death was attributed to treatment toxicity. The main liver toxicity was transient and consisted of transaminase level elevation and hyperbilirubinemia. No cases of veno-occlusive disease were observed after the GO treatment. From the time of salvage treatment initiation, 1- and 2-year OS rates were 54% (95% confidence interval, 28%-74%) and 42% (95% confidence interval, 19%-63%), respectively.

Two principal mechanisms are responsible for this dysfunction; mutation and downregulation of wild-type p53 mediated by MDM2/MDM4. Because of its almost universal inactivation in malignancy, p53 is a highly attractive target for the development of new anticancer drugs. Although multiple strategies have been investigated for targeting dysfunctional p53 for cancer treatment, only 2 of these have so far yielded compounds for testing in clinical trials. These strategies include the identification of compounds for reactivating the mutant form of p53 back to its wild-type form and compounds for inhibiting the interaction between wild-type p53 and MDM2/MDM4. Currently, multiple p53-MDM2/MDM4 antagonists are undergoing clinical trials, the most advanced being idasanutlin which is currently undergoing testing in a phase III clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Two mutant p53-reactivating compounds have progressed to clinical trials, i.e., APR-246 and COTI-2. Although promising data has emerged from the testing of both MDM2/MDM4 inhibitors and mutant p53 reactivating compounds in preclinical models, it is still unclear if these agents have clinical efficacy. However, should any of the compounds currently being evaluated in clinical trials be shown to have efficacy, it is likely to usher in a new era in cancer treatment, especially as p53 dysfunction is so prevalent in human cancers.","['Duffy, Michael J', 'Synnott, Naoise C', ""O'Grady, Shane"", 'Crown, John']","['Duffy MJ', 'Synnott NC', ""O'Grady S"", 'Crown J']","[""UCD School of Medicine, Conway Institute of Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; UCD Clinical Research Centre, St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.

We have previously identified retinoic acid-induced gene G (Rig-G) as a tumor suppressor in not only acute promyelocytic leukemia, but also in other solid tumors. However, the clinical significance of Rig-G and the underlying mechanism(s) for its biological function in lung cancer remain largely unexplored. Herein, we first compared the expression of Rig-G between lung cancer (n = 138) and normal tissues (n = 23), from public-available data sets and our patient cohort. We further analyzed the correlation of Rig-G expression with key clinico-pathological features and survival outcomes in a multi-site clinical cohort of 300 lung cancer patients. Functional studies for Rig-G were performed in cell lines, and an animal model to support clinical findings. We found that Rig-G was frequently downregulated in lung cancer tissues and cell lines, and correlated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. Overexpression of Rig-G led to significantly reduced cell growth and suppressed migration in A549 and NCI-H1944 cells, accompanied by reduced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Likewise, restoration of Rig-G in Lewis lung carcinoma cells permitted development of fewer cancer metastases versus controls in an animal model. Gene expression profiling results identified p53 pathway as a key downstream target of Rig-G, and p53 inhibition by pifithrin-alpha caused abrogation of tumor-suppressive effects of Rig-G in lung cancer. In conclusion, we, for the first time, have identified Rig-G as a novel and important tumor suppressor, which may serve as a potential therapeutic target for restoring p53 expression in lung cancer patients.","['Sun, Junjun', 'Wang, Xuan', 'Liu, Wenfang', 'Ji, Ping', 'Shang, Anquan', 'Wu, Junlu', 'Zhou, Hao', 'Quan, Wenqiang', 'Yao, Yiwen', 'Yang, Yibao', 'Gu, ChenZheng', 'Sun, Zujun', 'Goel, Ajay', 'Weng, Wenhao', 'Li, Dong']","['Sun J', 'Wang X', 'Liu W', 'Ji P', 'Shang A', 'Wu J', 'Zhou H', 'Quan W', 'Yao Y', 'Yang Y', 'Gu C', 'Sun Z', 'Goel A', 'Weng W', 'Li D']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Pharmacy, Putuo People's Hospital, Shanghai, China."", 'Department of General Surgery, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnostics and Experimental Therapeutics, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Yangpu Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Gastrointestinal Surgery and Translational Medicine, Yangpu Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Shanghai Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (IFIT3 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', '*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Rig-G', '*epithelial-mesenchymal transition', '*lung adenocarcinoma', '*metastasis', '*p53', '*prognosis', '*therapy']",2020/08/03 06:00,2021/03/11 06:00,['2020/08/03 06:00'],"['2020/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fj.201903220R [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2020 Sep;34(9):11900-11912. doi: 10.1096/fj.201903220R.

METHODS: qSOFA score, as well as the association of qSOFA score with ICU admission, infectious mortality, blood culture findings, and C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements during FN were assessed among 125 adult AML patients with 355 FN periods receiving intensive chemotherapy in a tertiary care hospital from November 2006 to December 2018. RESULTS: The multivariate model for qSOFA score >/= 2 included CRP >/= 150 mg/L on d0-2 [OR 2.9 (95% CI 1.1-7.3), P = .026], Gram-negative bacteremia [OR 2.7 (95% CI 1.1-6.9), P = .034], and treatment according to AML-2003 vs more recent protocols [OR 2.7 (95% CI 1.0-7.4), P = .047]. Age or gender did not gain significance in the model. qSOFA score >/= 2 was associated with ICU treatment and infectious mortality during FN with sensitivity and specificity of 0.700 and 0.979, and 1.000 and 0.971, respectively. CONCLUSION: qSOFA offers a useful tool to evaluate the risk of serious complications in AML patients during FN.","['Lappalainen, Marika', 'Hamalainen, Sari', 'Romppanen, Tuomo', 'Pulkki, Kari', 'Pyorala, Marja', 'Koivula, Irma', 'Jantunen, Esa', 'Juutilainen, Auni']","['Lappalainen M', 'Hamalainen S', 'Romppanen T', 'Pulkki K', 'Pyorala M', 'Koivula I', 'Jantunen E', 'Juutilainen A']","['Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine/Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine/Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Laboratory Division, Turku University Hospital, Clinical Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', 'Eastern Finland Laboratory Centre, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine/Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine, North Carelia Central Hospital, Joensuu, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine/Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Culture', 'C-Reactive Protein', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Febrile Neutropenia/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Organ Dysfunction Scores', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Prognosis', 'Public Health Surveillance', 'Sepsis/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'febrile neutropenia', 'quick Sequential Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score']",2020/08/03 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2020/08/03 06:00'],"['2020/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13500 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 Dec;105(6):731-740. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13500.

METHODS: We selected children with leukemia (n = 10) and healthy children (n = 11), which were submitted to a session of respiratory physical therapy. We used Spiron Kids (NCS, Brazil), Children's Voldyne (HUDSON RCI, USA), and Shaker (NCS, Brazil) as respiratory devices. The respiratory exercise protocols were founded on three standardized protocols. HR variability (HRV) was analyzed before, in the first minute and 5 to 10 min after intervention. RESULTS: We recognized no change between rest and recovery from intervention in HRV (rMSSD-square root mean square of the differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals)-Control: p = 0.8111, Leukemia: p = 0.1197, among groups: p = 0.6574; SD1-standard deviation from instantaneous beat-to-beat variability-Control: p = 0.8111, Leukemia: p = 0.131, among groups: p = 0.6556; 0V-with no variation (3 equal symbols, for example (2,2,2)-Control: p = 0.3679, Leukemia: p = 0.3553, among groups: p = 0.7421); 2UV-with two variations to the contrary (the three symbols form a peak or a valley, for instance (3,5,3)-Control: p = 0.3679, Leukemia: p = 0.2359, among groups: p = 0.4007). HF-high frequency component, range 0.15 to 0.4 Hz-decreased 0 to 1 min after intervention in the leukemia group (p = 0.0303) and no change was observed in the control group between rest versus recovery from intervention (p = 0.9761). No significant change was reported in HF between groups (p = 0.8700). Two leukemia subjects treated with vincristine presented different HRV responses to the intervention group. CONCLUSION: A respiratory physical therapy session did not significantly change autonomic control of HR in children with leukemia. Yet, clinicians should be mindful of subjects undergoing treatment with vincristine.","['Kirizawa, Jociele M', 'Garner, David M', 'Valenti, Vitor E']","['Kirizawa JM', 'Garner DM', 'Valenti VE']","['Autonomic Nervous System Center, Sao Paulo State University, UNESP, Av.

Cytokine levels contribute to the pathology of MDS. Hence, the objectives were to evaluate cytogenetic profile as a prognostic indicator in risk stratification and cytokine levels as a screening tool in patients with cytopenia for diagnosis. Over 2 years (2016-2018), 150 elderly patients were screened. MDS diagnosis was confirmed by morphology. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-6 levels were assessed in 50 patients, and karyotyping was performed in 20 confirmed cases of MDS. Age-matched healthy controls were used for comparison of cytokine levels. Among 150 patients, 88.6% had anemia, including nutritional anemia (51.2%). MDS diagnosis was confirmed in 35 patients. In 15 patients, unexplained cytopenia (UC) was present. Karyotyping in 20 MDS patients was normal in 15 (75%) patients and revealed a complex karyotype in four (20%) patients and double chromosomal abnormality in one (5%) patient. The Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) scored 91% in the low-risk group and 9% (n=3) in the high-risk group; the latter three developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and two of them had a 7q deletion. Among the 15 cases of UC, one patient died from refractory anemia. No significant difference in levels of IL-2 and IL-6 were found between MDS and UC patients when compared with healthy controls, as well as between different risk groups and karyotypes. A significant difference in IL-2 levels was found in MDS patients with disease progression and with stable disease. On the basis of the findings, it is suggested that IL-2 levels will help in predicting disease progression.","['Kaniyattu, Shaila Mathai', 'Meenakshi, Arumugam', 'Kumar, Mohana B', 'Kumar, Karuna Ramesh', 'Rao, Shama', 'Shetty, Prashanth D', 'Shetty, Vijith', 'Shetty, Jayaprakash K', 'Shetty, Padma K']","['Kaniyattu SM', 'Meenakshi A', 'Kumar MB', 'Kumar KR', 'Rao S', 'Shetty PD', 'Shetty V', 'Shetty JK', 'Shetty PK']","['K.

Since management and long-term outcomes remain poorly described, we retrospectively analyzed results of 27 adults from 21 departments of nephrology in France accrued over 19 years. Inclusion criteria were presence of glomerular Congo red-negative monotypic immunoglobulin deposits with ultrastructural microtubular organization, without evidence for cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis. Baseline manifestations of this cohort included: proteinuria (median 6.0 g/day), nephrotic syndrome (70%), microscopic hematuria (74%) and hypertension (56%) with a median serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL. Nineteen patients had detectable serum and/or urine monoclonal gammopathy. A bone marrow and/or peripheral blood clonal disorder was identified in 18 cases (16 lymphocytic and 2 plasmacytic disorders). Hematologic diagnosis was chronic/small lymphocytic lymphoma in 13, and monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance in 14 cases. Kidney biopsy showed atypical membranous in 16 or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 11 cases, with microtubular monotypic IgG deposits (kappa in 17 of 27 cases), most commonly IgG1. Identical intracytoplasmic microtubules were observed in clonal lymphocytes from 5 of 10 tested patients. Among 21 patients who received alkylating agents, rituximab-based or bortezomib-based chemotherapy, 18 achieved a kidney response. After a median follow-up of 40 months, 16 patients had sustained kidney response, 7 had reached end-stage kidney disease, and 6 died. Chronic/small lymphocytic lymphoma appears as a common underlying condition in immunotactoid glomerulopathy, but clonal detection remains inconstant with routine techniques in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance.

We hypothesized that greater comorbidity burden predicts worse 1-month mortality and overall survival (OS) in patients >/=60 years with AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 50,668 patients >/=60 years diagnosed between 2004 and 2014 from the National Cancer Database; patients were divided into 3 groups with Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) 0, 1, and >/=2. Chi-square tests were used to examine the association between CCI and different variables. We used logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models to determine predictors of 1-month mortality and OS, respectively. RESULTS: Among the entire cohort, 65% had CCI 0, 24% had CCI 1, and 11% had CCI >/=2. Thirty-four percent did not receive chemotherapy. Patients with CCI 0 were more likely to receive chemotherapy, especially multiagent chemotherapy and undergo upfront hematopoietic cell transplantation. In multivariate analyses, 1-month mortality and OS were significantly worse with CCI 1 or >/=2, compared with CCI 0 in the entire cohort, as the subgroup of only those patients who received chemotherapy. Younger age, male gender, higher annual income, academic facility, longer travel distance, and acute promyelocytic leukemia were associated with improved OS. CONCLUSION: In one of the largest real-world studies of older adults with AML, we demonstrated that greater comorbidity, measured by higher CCI, independently predicted worse early mortality and OS in older patients with AML. Higher CCI was more common with increasing age and correlated with lower likelihood of receiving chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation. Whether optimal comorbidity management and supportive care may improve outcomes needs to be studied further.","['Dhakal, Prajwal', 'Shostrom, Valerie', 'Al-Kadhimi, Zaid S', 'Maness, Lori J', 'Gundabolu, Krishna', 'Bhatt, Vijaya Raj']","['Dhakal P', 'Shostrom V', 'Al-Kadhimi ZS', 'Maness LJ', 'Gundabolu K', 'Bhatt VR']","['Division of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE; Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.

Rich antioxidant composition of RR was reflected in its high antioxidant activity (2.1 mM/kg Trolox equivalent) as well as oxidative stability (activation energy 105.6 kJ/mol). The RR emulsions led to marked augmentation of the total cell protein content in BALB/3T3 and NHDF cultures, inhibited cancer cell migration and reduced ROS formation.

We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of allo-HSCT in 111 patients in 15 Japanese institutions as a multi-institutional joint research project. Thirty-nine patients received bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from related donors (rBMT/rPBSCT), 37 received BMT/PBSCT from unrelated donors (uBMT/uPBSCT), and 35 received cord blood transplantation (CBT). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 years were 42% and 34%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of relapse and nonrelapse mortality were 43% and 25%. In multivariate analysis, CBT showed comparable OS with rBMT/rPBSCT (rBMT/rPBSCT versus CBT: hazard ratio [HR], 1.63; P = .264) and better OS compared with uBMT/uPBSCT (HR, 2.99; P = .010), with a trend toward a lower relapse rate (rBMT/rPBSCT versus CBT: HR, 2.60; P = .010; uBMT/uPBSCT versus CBT: HR, 2.05; P = .082). This superiority of CBT was more definite in on-disease patients (OS: rBMT/rPBSCT versus CBT: HR, 5.52; P = .021; uBMT/uPBSCT versus CBT: HR, 6.80; P = .007). Better disease control was also strongly associated with better OS and PFS with lower relapse rate. In conclusion, allo-HSCT is beneficial for the survival of patients with mature T and NK cell lymphomas/leukemia if performed in a timely fashion. Since CBT showed favorable survival with a lower relapse risk, it could be a preferred alternative, especially in on-disease patients.","['Watanabe, Mizuki', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Arai, Yasuyuki', 'Hishizawa, Masakatsu', 'Nishikori, Momoko', 'Ishikawa, Takayuki', 'Imada, Kazunori', 'Ueda, Yasunori', 'Akasaka, Takashi', 'Yonezawa, Akihito', 'Nohgawa, Masaharu', 'Kitano, Toshiyuki', 'Itoh, Mitsuru', 'Takeoka, Tomoharu', 'Moriguchi, Toshinori', 'Yago, Kazuhiro', 'Arima, Nobuyoshi', 'Anzai, Naoyuki', 'Watanabe, Mitsumasa', 'Kondo, Tadakazu', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi']","['Watanabe M', 'Kanda J', 'Arai Y', 'Hishizawa M', 'Nishikori M', 'Ishikawa T', 'Imada K', 'Ueda Y', 'Akasaka T', 'Yonezawa A', 'Nohgawa M', 'Kitano T', 'Itoh M', 'Takeoka T', 'Moriguchi T', 'Yago K', 'Arima N', 'Anzai N', 'Watanabe M', 'Kondo T', 'Takaori-Kondo A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.

Herein, we report a study of diverse myeloid malignancies with blasts showing MC-differentiation but not meeting the criteria for SM-AHN or MML. We also evaluated the utility of flow-cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI) in the characterization of immature-MCs (iMCs). METHODS: We identified nine patients of myeloid neoplasms and studied their morphological, FCI, immunohistochemistry, cytogenetic and molecular characteristics. We also compared the immunophenotypic features of MCs from patient samples with control samples. RESULTS: The study included patients with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (n = 4), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 1), and chronic myeloid leukemia on follow-up (n = 4) showing MC differentiation in leukemic-blasts. These patients had mildly increased MCs (range, 0.5%-3%) in bone-marrow morphology, including immature-forms and did not meet the criteria for either SM-AHN or MML. On FCI, iMCs were positive for bright-CD117, heterogeneous-CD34, dim-to-negative-HLADR, and moderate-CD203c expression. Expression-levels of CD123 and CD38 were higher (p < 0.001) but CD33 and CD45 were lower in iMCs compared to mature-MC from control samples (p = 0.019 and p = 0.0037). CONCLUSION: We reported a rare finding of MC differentiation of leukemic blasts in diverse myeloid neoplasms and proposed it as a potential pre-myelomastocytic leukemia condition. We described the distinct immunophenotypic signature of immature-MCs using commonly used markers and highlighted the utility of FCI for the diagnosis of this entity.","['Panda, Devasis', 'Chatterjee, Gaurav', 'Khanka, Twinkle', 'Ghogale, Sitaram', 'Badrinath, Yajamanam', 'Deshpande, Nilesh', 'Sardana, Rohan', 'Chaturvedi, Anumeha', 'Rajpal, Sweta', 'Shetty, Dhanalaxmi', 'Patkar, Nikhil V', 'Gujral, Sumeet', 'Subramanian, Papagudi G', 'Tembhare, Prashant R']","['Panda D', 'Chatterjee G', 'Khanka T', 'Ghogale S', 'Badrinath Y', 'Deshpande N', 'Sardana R', 'Chaturvedi A', 'Rajpal S', 'Shetty D', 'Patkar NV', 'Gujral S', 'Subramanian PG', 'Tembhare PR']","['Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Cancer Cytogenetics, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Tata Memorial Center, Mumbai, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Hematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Center, HBNI University, Navi Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), which acts as the ATP subunit of mammalian SWI-SNF-related chromatin remodeling complexes, is involved in human acute myeloid leukemia and highly expresses in short-term HSPCs. But its role and regulatory mechanism for HSPC development have not yet been well established. Here, we generated a brg1 knockout zebrafish model using TALEN technology. We found that in brg1(-/-) embryo, the primitive hematopoiesis remained well, while definitive hematopoiesis formation was significantly impaired. The number of hemogenic endothelial cells was decreased, further affecting definitive hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid and lymphoid cells. During embryogenesis, the nitric oxide (NO) microenvironment in brg1(-/-) embryo was seriously damaged and the reduction of HSPCs could be partially rescued by a NO donor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that BRG1 could bind to the promoter of KLF2 and trigger its transcriptional activity of NO synthase. Our findings show that Brg1 promotes klf2a expression in hemogenic endothelium and highlight a novel mechanism for HSPC formation and maintenance.","['Tu, Jiayi', 'Liu, Xiliang', 'Jia, Haibo', 'Reilly, James', 'Yu, Shanshan', 'Cai, Chen', 'Liu, Fei', 'Lv, Yuexia', 'Huang, Yuwen', 'Lu, Zhaojing', 'Han, Shanshan', 'Jiang, Tao', 'Shu, Xinhua', 'Wu, Xiaoyan', 'Tang, Zhaohui', 'Lu, Qunwei', 'Liu, Mugen']","['Tu J', 'Liu X', 'Jia H', 'Reilly J', 'Yu S', 'Cai C', 'Liu F', 'Lv Y', 'Huang Y', 'Lu Z', 'Han S', 'Jiang T', 'Shu X', 'Wu X', 'Tang Z', 'Lu Q', 'Liu M']","['Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, Scotland.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Medical College, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, Scotland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Klf2a protein, zebrafish)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (smarca4a protein, zebrafish)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/*embryology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nitric Oxide/genetics/metabolism', 'Response Elements', '*Stem Cell Niche', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Zebrafish/*embryology/genetics', 'Zebrafish Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Brg1', '*Klf2a-NO signaling', '*chromatin remodeling', '*epigenetics', '*hematopoietic stem cells']",2020/08/02 06:00,2021/03/11 06:00,['2020/08/02 06:00'],"['2019/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fj.201903168RR [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2020 Sep;34(9):11997-12008. doi: 10.1096/fj.201903168RR.

We report bacterial sepsis following a pathogen-reduced PLT transfusion. CASE REPORT: An adult male with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia was successfully treated for central catheter-associated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) was placed. Chills, rigors, and flushing developed immediately after PICC-infused pathogen-reduced PLTs, progressing to septic shock requiring intensive care management. METHODS: PICC and peripheral blood (PB), transfused bag saline flushes (TBFs), environmental samples, and the pathogen-reduced untransfused co-component (CC) were cultured. Plasma metagenomic and bacterial isolate whole-genome sequencing; PLT mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing of untransfused CC and TBF; CC testing for amotosalen (S-59)/S-59 photoproducts; isolate PR studies (INTERCEPT); and TBF polymerase chain reaction for recipient Y-chromosome DNA were performed. RESULTS: PB and PICC cultures grew Acinetobacter calcoaceticus/baumannii complex (ACBC). TBF was gram-positive; mass spectrometry identified ACBC and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (SS). CC Gram stain and cultures were negative. Environmental cultures, some done after decontamination, were ACBC/SS negative. Posttransfusion patient plasma and TBF ACBC sequences were genetically identical. No Y-chromosome signal was detected in TBF. S-59 photoproducts and evidence of mtDNA amplification inhibition were found in the CC. Spiking PR studies showed >5.9-log inactivation for both isolates. Donor skin cultures for Acinetobacter were negative. CONCLUSION: CC sterility, PR studies, residual S-59 photoproducts, and mtDNA amplification inhibition suggest successful PR. Unidentified environmental sources and inherent or acquired bag defects may have contributed to postmanufacturing pathogen-reduced PLT contamination.","['Fridey, Joy L', 'Stramer, Susan L', 'Nambiar, Ashok', 'Moayeri, Morvarid', 'Bakkour, Sonia', 'Langelier, Charles', 'Crawford, Emily', 'Lu, Thea', 'Lanteri, Marion C', 'Kamm, Jack', 'Miller, Steve', 'Wagner, Stephen J', 'Benjamin, Richard J', 'Busch, Michael P']","['Fridey JL', 'Stramer SL', 'Nambiar A', 'Moayeri M', 'Bakkour S', 'Langelier C', 'Crawford E', 'Lu T', 'Lanteri MC', 'Kamm J', 'Miller S', 'Wagner SJ', 'Benjamin RJ', 'Busch MP']","['Southern California Region, American Red Cross, Pomona, California, USA.', 'Scientific Affairs, American Red Cross, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Cerus Corporation, Concord, California, USA.', 'Cerus Corporation, Concord, California, USA.', 'Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Transfusion Innovation, American Red Cross, Rockville, Maryland, USA.', 'Cerus Corporation, Concord, California, USA.', 'Vitalant Research Institute, San Francisco, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['*Acinetobacter baumannii', '*Acinetobacter calcoaceticus', 'Adult', '*Bacterial Infections/blood/etiology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Platelet Transfusion', '*Plateletpheresis', '*Sepsis/blood/etiology/microbiology', '*Staphylococcus saprophyticus', '*Transfusion Reaction/blood/microbiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acinetobacter calcoaceticus/baumannii', '*Staphylococcus saprophyticus', '*pathogen reduction', '*septic transfusion reaction']",2020/08/02 06:00,2021/06/30 06:00,['2020/08/02 06:00'],"['2020/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.15951 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2020 Sep;60(9):1960-1969. doi: 10.1111/trf.15951.

This has primarily been shown in acute myeloid leukaemia and is different for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Until now no benefit of mould active prophylaxis has been demonstrated in the latter population. METHODS: In this retrospective single-centre study, we analysed the incidence, clinical relevance, and outcome of invasive fungal diseases (IFD) as well as the impact of antifungal prophylaxis for the first 100 days following the primary diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. RESULTS: In 58 patients a high rate of proven, probable, and possible fungal infections could be demonstrated with a 3.4%, 8.6%, and 17.2% likelihood, respectively. The incidence might be even higher, as nearly 40% of all patients had no prolonged neutropenia for more than 10 days, excluding those from the European Organization of Research and Treatment of cancer and the Mycoses Study Group criteria for probable invasive fungal disease. The diagnosed fungal diseases had an impact on the duration of hospitalisation, which was 13 days longer for patients with proven/probable IFD compared to patients with no signs of fungal infection. Use of antifungal prophylaxis did not significantly affect the risk of fungal infection. CONCLUSION: Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia are at high risk of acquiring an invasive fungal disease. Appropriate criteria to define fungal infections, especially in this population, and strategies to reduce the risk of infection, including antifungal prophylaxis, need to be further evaluated.","['Grundahl, Marie', 'Wacker, Beate', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Heinz, Werner J']","['Grundahl M', 'Wacker B', 'Einsele H', 'Heinz WJ']","['Department of Neurology, Klinikum Wurzburg Mitte, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department for Internal Medicine I, Klinikum Weiden, Weiden, Germany.', 'Med.

Human promyelocytic (HL-60) and monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cells were treated with the tested compounds for 24 h, and cytotoxicity, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis were evaluated. Significant differences were found in the susceptibility of these cell lines to all stilbenes, including RSV. The THP-1 cells were more resistant to cytotoxic activity of these compounds than HL-60 cells. Among the tested stilbenes, 3,4,4'-tri-MS and 3,4,2',4'-tetra-MS exhibited higher cytotoxicity toward both cell lines than RSV and the other methoxy stilbenes. This activity might be related to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and induction of apoptosis. In this regard, 3,4,4'-tri-MS and 3,4,2',4'-tetra-MS at highest concentrations increased the p53 protein level particularly in HL-60 cells. Moreover, treatment with these derivatives increased the ratio of the proapoptotic Bax protein to the antiapoptotic Bcl-xl protein, suggesting the induction of apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway in both cell lines. Further studies are required to fully elucidate the mechanism of these activities.","['Zielinska-Przyjemska, Malgorzata', 'Kaczmarek, Mariusz', 'Krajka-Kuzniak, Violetta', 'Wierzchowski, Marcin', 'Baer-Dubowska, Wanda']","['Zielinska-Przyjemska M', 'Kaczmarek M', 'Krajka-Kuzniak V', 'Wierzchowski M', 'Baer-Dubowska W']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland. mzielin@ump.edu.pl.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Chemical Technology of Drugs, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', '*Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Resveratrol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Stilbenes/*chemistry', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Methoxy stilbenes', 'Monocytic leukemia cells', 'Promyelocytic leukemia cells', 'Resveratrol']",2020/08/02 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/08/02 06:00'],"['2020/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11010-020-03837-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11010-020-03837-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2020 Nov;474(1-2):113-123. doi: 10.1007/s11010-020-03837-0.

The mean age at diagnosis of RB was 16 months (median 7 months; range 5-72 months). Treatment of RB with intravenous chemotherapy was noted in 3 (43%) patients, 1 (14%) patient had received external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the orbit, 1 (14%) patient had received a combination of chemotherapy and orbital EBRT, while 4 (57%) patients had undergone primary enucleation of the worse eye and focal treatment of the better eye. The mean age at detection of SPT was 15 years (median 8 years; range 6-46 years). The mean time interval between diagnosis of RB and SPT was 13 years (median 7 years; range 1-41 years). The SPT's included osteosarcoma of long bone (n = 2), eyelid sebaceous gland carcinoma (n = 2), ventricular ependymoma (n = 1), orbital neuroblastoma (n = 1), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 1). All patients received treatment for the SPT with either surgical excision (n = 2), intravenous chemotherapy (n = 1), or a combination of surgery/chemotherapy/radiotherapy (n = 4). Over a mean follow-up period of 8 years (median 8 years; range 4-11 years), one (14%) patient died, while other 6 (86%) patients are alive and well. CONCLUSION: Though the incidence of SPT's in cases of RB is rare, life-long follow-up is mandatory in at-risk patients.","['Kaliki, Swathi', 'Palkonda, Vijay Anand Reddy']","['Kaliki S', 'Palkonda VAR']","['Operation Eyesight, Universal Institute for Eye Cancer (SK, VARP), L V Prasad Eye Institute, 500034, Hyderabad, India. kalikiswathi@yahoo.com.', 'Operation Eyesight, Universal Institute for Eye Cancer (SK, VARP), L V Prasad Eye Institute, 500034, Hyderabad, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Int Ophthalmol,International ophthalmology,7904294,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Eye Enucleation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', '*Retinal Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', '*Retinoblastoma/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Eye', 'Retinoblastoma', 'Second cancer', 'Second primary tumor', 'Tumor']",2020/08/02 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/08/02 06:00'],"['2020/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10792-020-01517-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10792-020-01517-y [pii]']",ppublish,Int Ophthalmol. 2020 Dec;40(12):3303-3308. doi: 10.1007/s10792-020-01517-y.

Unfortunately, chemotherapy is associated with high hematopoietic toxicity that may limit its efficacy. We have previously established potential strategies to mitigate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (a lack of circulating neutrophils) using a mechanistic model of granulopoiesis to predict the interactions defining the neutrophil response to chemotherapy and to define optimal strategies for concurrent chemotherapy/prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Here, we extend our analyses to include monocyte production by constructing and parameterizing a model of monocytopoiesis. Using data for neutrophil and monocyte concentrations during chemotherapy in a large cohort of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, we leveraged our model to determine the relationship between the monocyte and neutrophil nadirs during cyclic chemotherapy. We show that monocytopenia precedes neutropenia by 3 days, and rationalize the use of G-CSF during chemotherapy by establishing that the onset of monocytopenia can be used as a clinical marker for G-CSF dosing post-chemotherapy. This work therefore has important clinical applications as a comprehensive approach to understanding the relationship between monocyte and neutrophils after cyclic chemotherapy with or without G-CSF support.","['Cassidy, Tyler', 'Humphries, Antony R', 'Craig, Morgan', 'Mackey, Michael C']","['Cassidy T', 'Humphries AR', 'Craig M', 'Mackey MC']","['Theoretical Biology and Biophysics, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, 87545, USA.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H3A 0B9, Canada.', 'Department of Physiology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H3A 0B9, Canada.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada. morgan.craig@umontreal.ca.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Centre, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada. morgan.craig@umontreal.ca.', 'Department of Physiology, McGill University, 3655 Drummond, Montreal, QC, H3G 1Y6, Canada.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, McGill University, 3655 Drummond, Montreal, QC, H3G 1Y6, Canada.', 'Department of Physics, McGill University, 3655 Drummond, Montreal, QC, H3G 1Y6, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Bull Math Biol,Bulletin of mathematical biology,0401404,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', '*Neutropenia/chemically induced/diagnosis/pathology', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cyclic chemotherapy', '*G-CSF', '*Mathematical modeling', '*Monocytes', '*Neutrophils', '*Therapy rationalization']",2020/08/02 06:00,2020/08/02 06:00,['2020/08/02 06:00'],"['2020/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11538-020-00777-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11538-020-00777-0 [pii]']",epublish,Bull Math Biol. 2020 Jul 31;82(8):104. doi: 10.1007/s11538-020-00777-0.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4852-4770'],20200731,,,"['PGS-D/Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada/International', 'RGPIN-2018-05062/Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada', '(CA)/International', 'RGPIN-2018-04546/Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada', '(CA)/International', '89233218CNA000001/U.S. Department of Energy/International', 'R01 AI116868/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 OD011095/OD/NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data on allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) outcomes are limited. We retrospectively analyzed 4649 AML patients who received allo-HCT and were in complete remission. Outcomes of Ph+ AML (n = 30), intermediate-risk, and poor-risk AML patients were compared. The 3-year overall survival after allo-HCT was similar in intermediate-risk (62.7%; 95% CI: 61.0-64.3%) and Ph+ AML (73.3%; 95% CI: 51.5-86.4%) groups (P = 0.42); however, it differed significantly between the poor-risk (49.7%; 95% CI: 45.9-53.4%) and Ph+ AML (73.3%; 95% CI: 51.5-86.4%) groups (P = 0.049). Disease-free survival in Ph+ AML patients was comparable to that in intermediate-risk patients but better than that in poor-risk patients. Relapse rates were significantly lower in Ph+ AML patients than in other groups. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) rates were similar among groups. Multivariate analysis showed that Ph+ AML was not a significant predictor of poor prognosis in terms of overall survival, disease-free survival, relapse, and NRM. Our data showed better post-transplant outcomes for Ph+ AML patients than for those with poor-risk AML. Hence, allo-HCT could be a feasible treatment option for Ph+ AML patients.","['Mizuno, Shohei', 'Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Kawamura, Koji', 'Masuko, Masayoshi', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Iwato, Koji', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru', 'Ikegame, Kazuhiro', 'Kim, Sung-Won', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Yano, Shingo', 'Takami, Akiyoshi']","['Mizuno S', 'Yanada M', 'Kawamura K', 'Masuko M', 'Uchida N', 'Ozawa Y', 'Iwato K', 'Ohashi K', 'Ikegame K', 'Kim SW', 'Tanaka M', 'Eto T', 'Kanda Y', 'Fukuda T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Yano S', 'Takami A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, Japan. shohei@aichi-med-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation, Niigata University Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Division of Hematology, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology and Hematology, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2020/08/02 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/08/02 06:00'],"['2020/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-01011-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-01011-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2021 Jan;56(1):232-242. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-01011-0.

Newborns with Down syndrome have an even higher risk of developing leukemia, which is thought to be driven by mutations that accumulate during fetal development. To characterize mutation accumulation in individual stem and progenitor cells of Down syndrome and karyotypically normal fetuses, we clonally expanded single cells and performed whole-genome sequencing. We found a higher mutation rate in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells during fetal development compared to the post-infant rate. In fetal trisomy 21 cells the number of somatic mutations is even further increased, which was already apparent during the first cell divisions of embryogenesis before gastrulation. The number and types of mutations in fetal trisomy 21 haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were similar to those in Down syndrome-associated myeloid preleukemia and could be attributed to mutational processes that were active during normal fetal haematopoiesis.

Using the framework developed by Buchanan and Brock for surrogate decision-making, I examine what role the adolescent should morally play when deciding about therapy for life-threatening conditions. I argue that the greater the efficacy of treatment, the less voice the adolescent (and the parent) should have. I then consider how refusals of highly effective transplant cases are similar to and different from refusals of other lifesaving therapies (eg, chemotherapy for leukemia), which is more commonly discussed in the media and medical literature. I examine whether organ scarcity and the need for lifelong immunosuppression justify differences in whether the state intervenes when an adolescent and his or her parents refuse a transplant. I argue that the state, as parens patriae, has an obligation to provide the social supports needed for a successful transplant and follow-up treatment plan, although family refusals may be permissible when the transplant is experimental or of low efficacy because of comorbidities or other factors. I conclude by discussing the need to limit media coverage of pediatric treatment refusals.","['Ross, Lainie Friedman']",['Ross LF'],"['Departments of Pediatrics, Medicine, and Surgery, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois lross@uchicago.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bioethical Issues', 'Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent By Minors/ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Male', 'Mass Media/*ethics', 'Organ Transplantation/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Parental Consent/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Patient Participation', 'Patient Self-Determination Act', 'Principle-Based Ethics', 'Treatment Refusal/*ethics/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Twins, Monozygotic', 'United Kingdom', 'United States']",,,2020/08/02 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2020/08/02 06:00'],"['2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2020-0818H [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2020-0818H [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2020 Aug;146(Suppl 1):S33-S41. doi: 10.1542/peds.2020-0818H.,,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.'],,,,,"['POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: The author has indicated she has no potential', 'conflicts of interest to disclose.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efficacious therapy for this subgroup of patients is currently lacking. To identify potential target(s) to selectively suppress PTEN-deficient GBM growth, we performed a three-step synthetic lethal screen on LN18 PTEN wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) isogeneic GBM cell lines using a library containing 606 target-selective inhibitors. A MCL1 inhibitor UMI-77 identified in the screen exhibited excellent suppression on the proliferation, colony formation, 3D spheroid, and neurosphere formation of PTEN-deficient GBM cells. Mechanistically, loss of PTEN in GBM cells led to upregulation of MCL1 in posttranslational level via inhibition of GSK3beta, and consequently confer cells resistance to apoptosis. Pharmacologic inhibition or knockdown of MCL1 blocked this PI3K-GSK3beta-MCL1 axis and caused reduction of several antiapoptotic proteins, finally induced massive caspase-3 cleavage and apoptosis. In both subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM models, knockdown of MCL1 significantly impaired the in vivo growth of PTEN-deficient xenografts. Moreover, the combination of UMI-77 and temozolomide synergistically killed PTEN-deficient GBM cells. Collectively, our work identified MCL1 as a promising target for PTEN-deficient GBM. For future clinical investigations, priority should be given to the development of a selective MCL1 inhibitor with efficient brain delivery and minimal in vivo toxicity.","['Chen, Chao', 'Zhu, Sichao', 'Zhang, Xia', 'Zhou, Tingting', 'Gu, Jing', 'Xu, Yurong', 'Wan, Quan', 'Qi, Xiao', 'Chai, Yezi', 'Liu, Xiaorong', 'Chen, Lukui', 'Yan, Jie', 'Hua, Yunfen', 'Lin, Fan']","['Chen C', 'Zhu S', 'Zhang X', 'Zhou T', 'Gu J', 'Xu Y', 'Wan Q', 'Qi X', 'Chai Y', 'Liu X', 'Chen L', 'Yan J', 'Hua Y', 'Lin F']","['Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, School of Medicine, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Forensic Science, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Science, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China. linfee@me.com.', 'Institute for Brain Tumors & Key Laboratory of Rare Metabolic Diseases, Nanjing Medical University; The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University; Key Laboratory of Human Functional Genomics of Jiangsu Province; Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Glioblastoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2020/08/02 06:00,2021/08/07 06:00,['2020/08/02 06:00'],"['2020/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-20-0099 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0099 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2020 Oct;19(10):2001-2011. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0099.

EVs have been shown to promote proliferation and angiogenesis, and alter the bone marrow microenvironment to favour the growth and survival of diverse HM. They also promote evasion of anti-cancer immune responses and increase multi-drug resistance. Using knowledge of EV biology, including HM-specific packaging of cargo, EV based diagnostics and therapeutic approaches show substantial clinical promise. However, while EVs may represent a new paradigm to solve many of the challenges in treating and/or diagnosing HM, much work is needed before they can be used clinically to improve patient outcomes.","['Longjohn, Modeline N', 'Hudson, Jo-Anna B J', 'Smith, Nicole C', 'Rise, Matthew L', 'Moorehead, Paul C', 'Christian, Sherri L']","['Longjohn MN', 'Hudson JBJ', 'Smith NC', 'Rise ML', 'Moorehead PC', 'Christian SL']","['Department of Biochemistry, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada.', ""Discipline of Pediatrics, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada; University of Ottawa, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Ocean Sciences, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada.', 'Department of Ocean Sciences, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada.', 'Discipline of Pediatrics, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada.

These deletions cause loss of a large contiguous chromosomal region encompassing more than 30 genes, which results in disease through haploinsufficiency of one or more genes including RPS14. In MDS, del(5q) in isolation is a lower-risk cytogenetic anomaly and is sometimes associated with a unique clinicopathological phenotype, but in AML it represents a higher-risk lesion, often denoting secondary AML arising from prior MDS. Lenalidomide effectively targets the del(5q)-bearing clone in MDS, resulting in sustained erythroid transfusion independence in most patients and cytogenetic remission in a subset of treated patients. Since the initial regulatory approval of lenalidomide for del(5q) MDS in 2005, translational research endeavors in del(5q)-associated myeloid malignancies have improved our understanding of how allelic haploinsufficiency underlies both the hematological phenotype and selective sensitivity to lenalidomide therapy. This review will focus on the molecular pathogenesis of del(5q) in myeloid malignancies, clinical development of lenalidomide and emerging data on lenalidomide-refractory del (5q) MDS, and possible novel targeted therapeutic strategies.","['Venugopal, Sangeetha', 'Mascarenhas, John', 'Steensma, David P']","['Venugopal S', 'Mascarenhas J', 'Steensma DP']","['Tisch Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.

However, while primary leukemia resistance has virtually disappeared, a sizable fraction of APL patients still die before or during induction therapy. Hemorrhagic death still remains the major problem during this early phase of treatment and, to a lesser extent, deaths due to infection, differentiation syndrome and other causes. Patients with APL typically present with a range of laboratory abnormalities consistent with the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation and hyperfibrinolysis. This APL-associated coagulopathy, as a result of a dysregulation of the hemostatic system due to the imbalance between procoagulant, anticoagulant and profibrinolytic mechanisms, may show a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from minimal bleeding or localized thrombosis to lethal or life-threatening hemorrhages or thrombotic events that sometimes occur concomitantly. Hemorrhagic events are the most common cause of death associated with APL coagulopathy, but thrombosis, a less recognized and probably underestimated life-threatening manifestation of the thrombo-hemorrhagic syndrome, is also a non-negligible cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with APL. In this article, we aim to discuss recent advances in the knowledge of pathogenesis, predictors of thrombo-hemorrhagic events, management of coagulopathy associated with APL and the controversial issues that still persist.","['Sanz, Miguel A', 'Montesinos, Pau']","['Sanz MA', 'Montesinos P']","['Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.

We tested this process on osteosarcoma cell lines TC71, OHS as well as osteosarcoma patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell lines M31, M36, and M60. We also validated our analysis using sarcoma patient-derived CTCs. RESULTS: We successfully identified heterogeneity within individual tumor cell lines, the same PDX cells, and the CTCs from the same patient by detecting multiple protein targets and protein localization. Overall, these data reveal that our t-SNE-based approach can not only identify rare cells within the same cell line or cell population, but also discriminate amongst varied groups to detect similarities and differences. CONCLUSIONS: This method helps us make greater inroads towards generating patient-specific CTC fingerprinting that could provide an accurate tumor status from a minimally-invasive liquid biopsy.","['Batth, Izhar S', 'Meng, Qing', 'Wang, Qi', 'Torres, Keila E', 'Burks, Jared', 'Wang, Jing', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Li, Shulin']","['Batth IS', 'Meng Q', 'Wang Q', 'Torres KE', 'Burks J', 'Wang J', 'Gorlick R', 'Li S']","['Department of Pediatrics-Research, Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Division of Science, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, Division of Surgery, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Division of Science, Houston, USA. jingwang@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Pediatrics-Research, Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics-Research, Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. sli4@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Vimentin)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Bone Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'DNA Fingerprinting', 'Humans', 'Image Cytometry/*methods', 'Liquid Biopsy', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*pathology', 'Osteosarcoma/*pathology', 'Protein Array Analysis/*methods', 'Vimentin/analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cell surface vimentin (CSV)', 'Circulating tumor cells (CTCs)', 'Copy number variations (CNV)', 'Cytometry time-of-flight (CyTOF)', 'Fine needle aspirates (FNA)', 'Fluorescence associated cell-sorting (FACS)', 'Imaging mass cytometry (IMC)', 'Patient-derived xenograft (PDX)', 'Smooth muscle actin (SMA)', 'T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)']",2020/08/02 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/08/02 06:00'],"['2019/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-020-07203-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-07203-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Jul 31;20(1):715. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-07203-7.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5657-4183'],20200731,,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB026291/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', ""CA016672/The National Institutes of Health through M.D. Anderson's Cancer Center"", 'Support Grant']",PMC7395380,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, knowledge about the outcomes and adverse events (AE) among patients at a population-based level is still limited. OBJECTIVES: To report outcomes and AEs in a population-based cohort treated with ibrutinib outside clinical trials. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study including all patients with CLL treated with ibrutinib. RESULTS: In total, 205 patients were included of whom 39 (19%) were treatment-naive. The median follow-up was 21.4 months (interquartile range (IQR), 11.9,32.8), the estimated overall survival at 12 months was 88.8% (95% confidence interval (CI); 84.3%, 93.3%), and the estimated progression-free survival at 12 months was 86.3% (95% CI; 81.3%, 91.2%). During follow-up, 200 (97.6%) patients had at least one AE and 100 (48.8%) patients had at least one grade >/=3 AE. Eighty-six patients (42.0%) discontinued ibrutinib, hereof 47 (54.7%) due to AEs and 19 (22.1%) had progression of CLL or Richter transformation. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we find comparable, though slightly inferior, overall, and progression-free survival, and discontinuation due to toxicity was higher compared with clinical trials.

Here, we review studies establishing an association between CH and hematopoietic malignancy, discuss features of CH that are predictive of leukemic progression, and explore the role of hematopoietic stressors in the evolution of CH to acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. CH due to point mutations or structural variants such as copy-number alterations is associated with an approximately 10-fold increased risk of hematopoietic malignancy. Although the absolute risk of hematopoietic malignancy is low, certain features of CH may confer a higher risk of transformation, including the presence of TP53 or spliceosome gene mutations, a variant allele fraction >10%, the presence of multiple mutations, and altered red blood indices. CH in the setting of peripheral blood cytopenias carries a very high risk of progression to a myeloid malignancy and merits close observation. There is emerging evidence suggesting that hematopoietic stressors contribute to both the development of CH and progression to hematopoietic malignancy. Specifically, there is evidence that genotoxic stress from chemotherapy or radiation therapy, ribosome biogenesis stress, and possibly inflammation may increase the risk of transformation from CH to a myeloid malignancy. Models that incorporate features of CH along with an assessment of hematopoietic stressors may eventually help predict and prevent the development of hematopoietic malignancies.","['Warren, Julia T', 'Link, Daniel C']","['Warren JT', 'Link DC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Clonal Evolution/drug effects/genetics', '*Clonal Hematopoiesis/drug effects/genetics', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology', '*Hematopoiesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology', 'Pancytopenia/etiology', 'Stress, Physiological']",,,2020/08/01 06:00,2021/03/23 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61668-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019000991 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Oct 1;136(14):1599-1605. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019000991.,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA171963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC8209630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the hematopoietic system, we analyzed the relative importance of cell fate-promoting mechanisms versus negating fate-suppressing mechanisms to engineer progenitor cells with multilineage differentiation potential. Deletion of the murine Gata2-77 enhancer, with a human equivalent that causes leukemia, downregulates the transcription factor GATA2 and blocks progenitor differentiation into erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, basophils, and granulocytes, but not macrophages. Using multiomics and single-cell analyses, we demonstrated that the enhancer orchestrates a balance between pro- and anti-fate circuitry in single cells. By increasing GATA2 expression, the enhancer instigates a fate-promoting mechanism while abrogating an innate immunity-linked, fate-suppressing mechanism. During embryogenesis, the suppressing mechanism dominated in enhancer mutant progenitors, thus yielding progenitors with a predominant monocytic differentiation potential. Coordinating fate-promoting and -suppressing circuits therefore averts deconstruction of a multifate system into a monopotent system and maintains critical progenitor heterogeneity and functionality.","['Johnson, Kirby D', 'Conn, Daniel J', 'Shishkova, Evgenia', 'Katsumura, Koichi R', 'Liu, Peng', 'Shen, Siqi', 'Ranheim, Erik A', 'Kraus, Sean G', 'Wang, Weixin', 'Calvo, Katherine R', 'Hsu, Amy P', 'Holland, Steven M', 'Coon, Joshua J', 'Keles, Sunduz', 'Bresnick, Emery H']","['Johnson KD', 'Conn DJ', 'Shishkova E', 'Katsumura KR', 'Liu P', 'Shen S', 'Ranheim EA', 'Kraus SG', 'Wang W', 'Calvo KR', 'Hsu AP', 'Holland SM', 'Coon JJ', 'Keles S', 'Bresnick EH']","['University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'Department of Statistics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison Blood Research Program, Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Basophils/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Erythrocytes/physiology', 'Female', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', '*Gene Deletion', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Megakaryocytes/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Stem Cells/*physiology']",,,2020/08/01 06:00,2021/03/11 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['151996 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20191526 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2020 Nov 2;217(11). pii: 151996. doi: 10.1084/jem.20191526.,,,,['(c) 2020 Johnson et al.'],"['P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T15 LM007359/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK068634/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 GM108538/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK068634/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7596813,,,['Disclosures: The authors declare no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathophysiologies of different IBMFSs are variable and can relate to defects in diverse biological processes, including DNA damage repair (Fanconi anemia), telomere maintenance (dyskeratosis congenita), and ribosome biogenesis (Diamond-Blackfan anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome). Somatic mutations leading to clonal hematopoiesis have been described in IBMFSs, but the distinct mechanisms by which mutations drive clonal advantage in each disease and their associations with leukemia risk are not well understood. Clinical observations and laboratory models of IBMFSs suggest that the germline deficiencies establish a qualitatively impaired functional state at baseline. In this context, somatic alterations can promote clonal hematopoiesis by improving the competitive fitness of specific hematopoietic stem cell clones. Some somatic alterations relieve baseline fitness constraints by normalizing the underlying germline deficit through direct reversion or indirect compensation, whereas others do so by subverting senescence or tumor-suppressor pathways. Clones with normalizing somatic mutations may have limited transformation potential that is due to retention of functionally intact fitness-sensing and tumor-suppressor pathways, whereas those with mutations that impair cellular elimination may have increased risk for malignant transformation that is due to subversion of tumor-suppressor pathways. Because clonal hematopoiesis is not deterministic of malignant transformation, rational surveillance strategies will depend on the ability to prospectively identify specific clones with increased leukemic potential. We describe a framework by which an understanding of the processes that promote clonal hematopoiesis in IBMFSs may inform clinical surveillance strategies.","['Tsai, Frederick D', 'Lindsley, R Coleman']","['Tsai FD', 'Lindsley RC']","['Division of Hematologic Neoplasia, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Division of Hematologic Neoplasia, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Clonal Evolution/genetics', '*Clonal Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes/diagnosis/*etiology', 'DNA Damage', 'Diagnosis, Differential', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype']",,,2020/08/01 06:00,2021/03/23 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61670-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019000990 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Oct 1;136(14):1615-1622. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019000990.,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['K08 CA204734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7530647,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mechanism-of-action studies, we have shown that these two separate actions synergize to induce cancer cell death in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell and animal models. Owning to the effectiveness of SKI-178, we sought to further refine the chemotype while maintaining ""on-target"" SKI and MDA activities. Herein, we modified the ""linker region"" between the substituted phenyl rings of SKI-178 through a structure guided approach. These studies have yielded the discovery of an SKI-178 congener, SKI-349, with log-fold enhancements in both SphK inhibition and cytotoxic potency. Importantly, SKI-349 also demonstrates log-fold improvements in therapeutic efficacy in a retro-viral transduction model of MLL-AF9 AML as compared to previous studies with SKI-178. Together, our results strengthen the hypothesis that simultaneous targeting of the sphingosine kinases (SphK1/2) and the induction of mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint arrest, via microtubule disruption, might be an effective therapeutic strategy for hematological malignancies including AML.","['Hengst, Jeremy A', 'Hegde, Shailaja', 'Paulson, Robert F', 'Yun, Jong K']","['Hengst JA', 'Hegde S', 'Paulson RF', 'Yun JK']","['Department of Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA, USA.', ""Hoxworth Blood Center, University of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA, USA.

There was lower relapse in the TBI/CY/TT group at 1 (14% versus 26%), 5 (24% versus 36%), 10 (26% versus 37%), and 15 years (26% versus 37%) (P= .02) but was not statistically significant on multivariate analysis. The TBI/CY/TT group showed a trend toward improved disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 (59% versus 47%), 10 (56% versus 46%), and 15 years (49% versus 40%) (P = .05) but was not statistically significant on multivariate analysis. Comparing overall survival at 5 (62% versus 53%), 10 (57% versus 50%), and 15 years (50% versus 44%) demonstrated no statistical difference between the 2 groups. The addition of thiotepa to TBI/CY demonstrated no increase in transplant-related mortality for pediatric ALL HSCT but was unable to demonstrate significant benefit in disease control. Minimal residual disease status remained the key risk factor impacting both relapse and DFS. More studies are warranted to better clarify the benefits of using thiotepa in conditioning for ALL HSCT.","['Chinnabhandar, Vasant', 'Tran, Steven', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Shaw, Peter J', 'Mechinaud, Francoise', 'Cole, Catherine', 'Tapp, Heather', 'Teague, Lochie', 'Fraser, Chris', ""O'Brien, Tracey A"", 'Mitchell, Richard']","['Chinnabhandar V', 'Tran S', 'Sutton R', 'Shaw PJ', 'Mechinaud F', 'Cole C', 'Tapp H', 'Teague L', 'Fraser C', ""O'Brien TA"", 'Mitchell R']","[""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia."", 'Australasian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry, Darlinghurst, New South Wales, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Children's Hospital Westmead, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Centre, The Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."", ""Princess Margaret Children's Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, Australia."", ""Michael Rice Centre for Haematology/Oncology, Women & Children's Hospital, North Adelaide, South Australia, Australia."", ""Starship Children's Hospital, Grafton, Auckland, New Zealand."", ""Oncology Service, Queensland Children's Hospital, South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia; School of Women & Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia; School of Women & Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Currently, no standard therapy for such patients exists. Preclinical studies have shown that inhibition of the nuclear export protein exportin 1 (XPO1) causes nuclear accumulation of p53 and disruption of NF-kappaB signalling, both relevant targets for myelodysplastic syndromes. We therefore aimed to assess the safety and activity of selinexor in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or oligoblastic acute myeloid leukaemia refractory to hypomethylating agents. METHODS: We did a single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 trial at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the USA. We included patients 18 years or older with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes or oligoblastic acute myeloid leukaemia (defined as blasts >/=20% but </=30%) refractory to hypomethylating agents and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-2. Eligible patients received 3-week long cycles of oral selinexor (60 mg twice per week for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week off). The primary outcome was overall response rate. Complete remission, partial remission, marrow complete remission, or haematological improvement were included in the response categories for assessing the primary endpoint. The activity analysis included all patients who completed at least one full-scheduled post-treatment disease assessment. All patients who were given selinexor were included in the safety analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02228525. FINDINGS: Between Sept 23, 2014, and March 13, 2018, 25 patients were enrolled on this study. The median follow-up was 8.5 months (IQR 3.1-12.2). Two patients did not meet the full eligibility criteria after baseline assessment; therefore, 23 patients were evaluable for activity assessment. In the 23 evaluable patients, overall response rate was 26% (95% CI 10-48) in six patients with marrow complete remission, with an additional 12 patients (52%, 95% CI 31-73) achieving stable disease. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (eight [32%] of 25 patients) and hyponatraemia (five [20%]). There were no drug-related serious adverse events and no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: Selinexor showed responses in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or oligoblastic acute myeloid leukaemia refractory to hypomethylating agents. Adverse events were manageable with supportive care implementation. Further studies are needed to compare selinexor with supportive care alone, and to identify patient subgroups that might benefit the most from selinexor treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all cases diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia over the period from June 2015 to March 2019. The normalized copy number (NCN) was tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction at diagnosis, and at the end of induction regimen. RESULTS: Our study included 83 de novo APL patients, 53 (63.9%) were adults and 30 (36.1%) were children. The median (range) age of our patients was 28.0 (1.0-70.0) years. The pediatric group had a significantly higher prevalence in males (p = 0.02), higher incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (p = 0.014), and high-risk groups (p = 0.017). At diagnosis, the median NCN (%) of the entire group at 22.5 was set as the cut off value. There was no significant association between NCN at diagnosis and other prognostic variables except for bone marrow promyelocytes (p = 0.006). High-risk group APL patients as well as those presenting with hemorrhage had an inferior overall survival (OS) (p = 0.007; p < 0.001) respectively. PML-RARA NCN at diagnosis did not have an impact on the OS or increased risk of relapse of our patients (p = 0.434; p = 0.721). CONCLUSION: the initial PML/RARA tumor burden is not a prognostic factor for APL. The initial TLC at 10x10(9)/L cut off is the most important predictive for OS. Early detection and close monitoring are required to decrease the high rate of early deaths in developing countries.","['Rasekh, Eman O', 'Elsayed, Ghada M', 'Fathy, Sherouk']","['Rasekh EO', 'Elsayed GM', 'Fathy S']","['Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, P.O Box 11796, Kasr Al Eini street, Fom El Khalig, Cairo, Egypt.

Since June 2013, 190 patients >/=18 years of age with MCL in British Columbia have been treated with bendamustine and rituximab (BR). The overall response rate to BR was 88% (54% complete response). Of these, 61 of 89 patients (69%) aged </=65 years received autologous stem cell transplantation and 141 of 190 patients (74%) from the entire cohort received maintenance rituximab. Twenty-three patients (12%) had progressive disease, associated with high risk per the Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI), Ki-67 >/=50%, and blastoid/pleomorphic histology. Outcomes were compared with a historical cohort of 248 patients treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP; January 2003 to May 2013). Treatment with BR was associated with significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS), but not overall survival (OS), compared with R-CHOP in the whole cohort (3-year PFS, 66% BR vs 51% R-CHOP, P = .003; 3-year OS, 73% BR vs 66% R-CHOP, P = .054) and in those >65 years of age (3-year PFS, 56% BR vs 35% R-CHOP, P = .001; 3-year OS, 64% BR vs 55% R-CHOP, P = .063). Outcomes in transplanted patients were not statistically significantly different compared with R-CHOP (3-year PFS, 85% BR vs 76% R-CHOP, P = .135; 3-year OS, 90% BR vs 88% R-CHOP, P = .305), although in multivariate analyses, treatment with BR was associated with improved PFS (hazard ratio, 0.40 [95% confidence interval, 0.17-0.94]; P = .036) but not OS. BR is an effective first-line option for most patients with MCL, however, outcomes are suboptimal for those with high-risk features and further studies integrating novel agents are warranted.","['Villa, Diego', 'Sehn, Laurie H', 'Savage, Kerry J', 'Toze, Cynthia L', 'Song, Kevin', 'den Brok, Wendie D', 'Freeman, Ciara L', 'Scott, David W', 'Gerrie, Alina S']","['Villa D', 'Sehn LH', 'Savage KJ', 'Toze CL', 'Song K', 'den Brok WD', 'Freeman CL', 'Scott DW', 'Gerrie AS']","['Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of BC, Vancouver Coastal Health/University of British Columbia/BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver Coastal Health/University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; and.', 'Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of BC, Vancouver Coastal Health/University of British Columbia/BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver Coastal Health/University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; and.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Fraser Valley Centre, BC Cancer Agency, Surrey, BC, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of BC, Vancouver Coastal Health/University of British Columbia/BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver Coastal Health/University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride/therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', '*Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,,2020/08/01 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31574-3 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002068 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Aug 11;4(15):3486-3494. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002068.,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,PMC7422137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transplant-eligible patients with NDMM received 4 cycles of KRd induction, ASCT, 4 cycles of KRd consolidation, and 10 cycles of KRd maintenance. The primary end point was rate of stringent complete response (sCR) after 8 cycles of KRd with a predefined threshold of >/=50% to support further study. Seventy-six patients were enrolled with a median age of 59 years (range, 40-76 years), and 35.5% had high-risk cytogenetics. The primary end point was met, with an sCR rate of 60% after 8 cycles. Depth of response improved over time. On intent-to-treat (ITT), the sCR rate reached 76%. The rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity using modified ITT was 70% according to next-generation sequencing (<10-5 sensitivity). After median follow-up of 56 months, 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 72% and 84% for ITT, 85% and 91% for MRD-negative patients, and 57% and 72% for patients with high-risk cytogenetics. For high-risk patients who were MRD negative, 5-year rates were 77% and 81%. Grade 3 to 4 adverse events included neutropenia (34%), lymphopenia (32%), infection (22%), and cardiac events (3%). There was no grade 3 to 4 peripheral neuropathy. Patients with NDMM treated with KRd with ASCT achieved high rates of sCR and MRD-negative disease at the end of KRd consolidation.

Although extensive data exist for adult myeloid malignancies, there are limited preclinical data on the efficacy and/or dosing of venetoclax for pediatric myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or AML and thus little information to guide use of this regimen in pediatric patients. Our objective was to describe our single-center experience with venetoclax in combination with the hypomethylating agent 5-azacitidine (aza) in pediatric patients with MDS or AML. PROCEDURE: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients treated at Children's Hospital Colorado prior to March 2020 with at least one cycle of ven/aza. Patients were included if between the ages of 1 and 25 years with a diagnosis of high-grade MDS or AML. AML patients had relapsed or primary refractory disease or were deemed poor candidates for standard chemotherapy. RESULTS: Eight patients received ven/aza, two for high-grade MDS and six for AML. Ven/aza was well tolerated by all patients. The most common adverse events seen with this regimen were gastrointestinal and hematologic. Morphologic responses were seen in six patients including both patients with MDS. All four AML responders became minimal residual disease negative. Three responders have thus far proceeded to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant following ven/aza. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical experience suggests that ven/aza is a safe and promising regimen that should be further explored with late-phase clinical trials.","['Winters, Amanda C', 'Maloney, Kelly W', 'Treece, Amy L', 'Gore, Lia', 'Franklin, Anna K']","['Winters AC', 'Maloney KW', 'Treece AL', 'Gore L', 'Franklin AK']","[""Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", ""Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*MDS', '*azacitidine', '*refractory', '*transplant', '*venetoclax']",2020/08/01 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28398 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Oct;67(10):e28398. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28398.

These long-term deficits include poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in school and lower educational achievement. Although social-ecological factors may impact these outcomes, it is not known which factors play a role. Our objective was to evaluate the factors affecting school HRQOL in Hispanic childhood cancer survivors, an important at-risk group. PROCEDURE: Multivariable regression analyses examined whether selected social-ecological factors contribute toward suboptimal school HRQOL in 73 Hispanic children treated with central nervous system (CNS)-directed cancer therapies after accounting for effects associated with established cancer-related risk factors. RESULTS: Consistent with expectations from prior research, in our multivariate analysis, the cancer-related factors of having a brain tumor diagnosis and being younger at cancer diagnosis were significant predictors of reduced parent-reported school HRQOL (F(2,65) = 5.46, P < .01) and accounted for 14% of the variance. Adding the social-ecological variables of parent education, child motivation, and parental knowledge accounted for an additional 25% of the variance in school HRQOL, where higher levels were associated with better child school HRQOL. Parenting knowledge was a contributor even after controlling for effects associated with the other variables in the model (F(1,62) = 4.88, P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivorship care should incorporate parent education interventions to enhance the child's school functioning, particularly for Hispanic childhood cancer survivors from predominantly Spanish-speaking families. Future research should consider other at-risk groups and incorporate social-ecological indicators to predict HRQOL outcomes.","['Patel, Sunita K', 'Johansen, Christopher', 'Gold, Abigail Onderwyzer', 'Delgado, Nicole', 'Xu, Sandra', 'Dennis, Jessica']","['Patel SK', 'Johansen C', 'Gold AO', 'Delgado N', 'Xu S', 'Dennis J']","['Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Supportive Care Medicine, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Psychology, California State University, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Child', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hispanic or Latino/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Prognosis', '*Quality of Life', 'Schools', '*Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood cancer survivor', '*cognitive late effects', '*health disparities', '*psychosocial', '*quality of life', '*school functioning']",2020/08/01 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28320 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Oct;67(10):e28320. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28320.

Several clinical and biological factors for CLL have been identified. However, it remains unclear which of the available prognostic models combining those factors can be used in clinical practice to predict long-term outcome in people newly-diagnosed with CLL. OBJECTIVES: To identify, describe and appraise all prognostic models developed to predict overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) or treatment-free survival (TFS) in newly-diagnosed (previously untreated) adults with CLL, and meta-analyse their predictive performances. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (from January 1950 to June 2019 via Ovid), Embase (from 1974 to June 2019) and registries of ongoing trials (to 5 March 2020) for development and validation studies of prognostic models for untreated adults with CLL. In addition, we screened the reference lists and citation indices of included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all prognostic models developed for CLL which predict OS, PFS, or TFS, provided they combined prognostic factors known before treatment initiation, and any studies that tested the performance of these models in individuals other than the ones included in model development (i.e. 'external model validation studies'). We included studies of adults with confirmed B-cell CLL who had not received treatment prior to the start of the study. We did not restrict the search based on study design. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We developed a data extraction form to collect information based on the Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS). Independent pairs of review authors screened references, extracted data and assessed risk of bias according to the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST). For models that were externally validated at least three times, we aimed to perform a quantitative meta-analysis of their predictive performance, notably their calibration (proportion of people predicted to experience the outcome who do so) and discrimination (ability to differentiate between people with and without the event) using a random-effects model. When a model categorised individuals into risk categories, we pooled outcome frequencies per risk group (low, intermediate, high and very high). We did not apply GRADE as guidance is not yet available for reviews of prognostic models. MAIN RESULTS: From 52 eligible studies, we identified 12 externally validated models: six were developed for OS, one for PFS and five for TFS. In general, reporting of the studies was poor, especially predictive performance measures for calibration and discrimination; but also basic information, such as eligibility criteria and the recruitment period of participants was often missing. We rated almost all studies at high or unclear risk of bias according to PROBAST. Overall, the applicability of the models and their validation studies was low or unclear; the most common reasons were inappropriate handling of missing data and serious reporting deficiencies concerning eligibility criteria, recruitment period, observation time and prediction performance measures. We report the results for three models predicting OS, which had available data from more than three external validation studies: CLL International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI) This score includes five prognostic factors: age, clinical stage, IgHV mutational status, B2-microglobulin and TP53 status. Calibration: for the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups, the pooled five-year survival per risk group from validation studies corresponded to the frequencies observed in the model development study. In the very high-risk group, predicted survival from CLL-IPI was lower than observed from external validation studies. Discrimination: the pooled c-statistic of seven external validation studies (3307 participants, 917 events) was 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 0.77). The 95% prediction interval (PI) of this model for the c-statistic, which describes the expected interval for the model's discriminative ability in a new external validation study, ranged from 0.59 to 0.83. Barcelona-Brno score Aimed at simplifying the CLL-IPI, this score includes three prognostic factors: IgHV mutational status, del(17p) and del(11q). Calibration: for the low- and intermediate-risk group, the pooled survival per risk group corresponded to the frequencies observed in the model development study, although the score seems to overestimate survival for the high-risk group. Discrimination: the pooled c-statistic of four external validation studies (1755 participants, 416 events) was 0.64 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.67); 95% PI 0.59 to 0.68. MDACC 2007 index score The authors presented two versions of this model including six prognostic factors to predict OS: age, B2-microglobulin, absolute lymphocyte count, gender, clinical stage and number of nodal groups. Only one validation study was available for the more comprehensive version of the model, a formula with a nomogram, while seven studies (5127 participants, 994 events) validated the simplified version of the model, the index score. Calibration: for the low- and intermediate-risk groups, the pooled survival per risk group corresponded to the frequencies observed in the model development study, although the score seems to overestimate survival for the high-risk group. Discrimination: the pooled c-statistic of the seven external validation studies for the index score was 0.65 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.70); 95% PI 0.51 to 0.77. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite the large number of published studies of prognostic models for OS, PFS or TFS for newly-diagnosed, untreated adults with CLL, only a minority of these (N = 12) have been externally validated for their respective primary outcome. Three models have undergone sufficient external validation to enable meta-analysis of the model's ability to predict survival outcomes. Lack of reporting prevented us from summarising calibration as recommended. Of the three models, the CLL-IPI shows the best discrimination, despite overestimation. However, performance of the models may change for individuals with CLL who receive improved treatment options, as the models included in this review were tested mostly on retrospective cohorts receiving a traditional treatment regimen. In conclusion, this review shows a clear need to improve the conducting and reporting of both prognostic model development and external validation studies. For prognostic models to be used as tools in clinical practice, the development of the models (and their subsequent validation studies) should adapt to include the latest therapy options to accurately predict performance. Adaptations should be timely.","['Kreuzberger, Nina', 'Damen, Johanna Aag', 'Trivella, Marialena', 'Estcourt, Lise J', 'Aldin, Angela', 'Umlauff, Lisa', 'Vazquez-Montes, Maria Dla', 'Wolff, Robert', 'Moons, Karel Gm', 'Monsef, Ina', 'Foroutan, Farid', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton', 'Skoetz, Nicole']","['Kreuzberger N', 'Damen JA', 'Trivella M', 'Estcourt LJ', 'Aldin A', 'Umlauff L', 'Vazquez-Montes MD', 'Wolff R', 'Moons KG', 'Monsef I', 'Foroutan F', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Skoetz N']","['Cochrane Haematology, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Cochrane Netherlands, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Centre for Statistics in Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Haematology/Transfusion Medicine, NHS Blood and Transplant, Oxford, UK.', 'Cochrane Haematology, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Cochrane Haematology, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd, York, UK.', 'Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.', 'Cochrane Haematology, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.', 'Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Cochrane Cancer, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Bias', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Calibration', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",,,2020/08/01 06:00,2020/09/26 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD012022.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2020 Jul 31;7:CD012022. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD012022.pub2.,,20200731,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

This study adapted an existing parent training intervention to improve outcomes for low-acculturated, Spanish-speaking Latino parents of children with leukemia and pilot tested that intervention for feasibility. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with a focus group of 20 Latino parents of children treated for leukemia. Ten Latino families participated in a pilot study of the adapted parenting intervention, consisting of eight sessions over 6 months. RESULTS: Focus groups revealed that parents unanimously supported a parenting intervention but barriers to participation included time constraints, transportation issues, and anxiety in the hospital environment. The parents also highlighted cultural factors that could contribute to the health disparity, such as lack of knowledge and efficacy in facilitating their child's progress with learning and school. In the pilot study, adherence was 90%, establishing feasibility, and the adapted intervention was considered beneficial. The median parenting efficacy scores improved from preintervention to postintervention (median 3.40 vs. 3.94; p < .011), as did parent-reported school functioning of the child (median 50.00 vs. 60.00; p = .088). CONCLUSIONS: This study addressed a health disparity by culturally adapting a parenting intervention, which was designed to improve school functioning, to meet the needs and preferences of low-acculturated, Spanish-speaking families of children with leukemia in Southern California. The pilot study demonstrated that the adapted intervention is feasible and acceptable in the target population. A larger trial is underway to test the efficacy of this adapted parenting intervention.","['Patel, Sunita K', 'Miranda, Leticia', 'Delgado, Nicole', 'Barreto, Nicolas', 'Nolty, Anne', 'Kelly, Natalie C', 'Wilson, Karla', 'Toomey, Debbie', 'Pawlowska, Anna']","['Patel SK', 'Miranda L', 'Delgado N', 'Barreto N', 'Nolty A', 'Kelly NC', 'Wilson K', 'Toomey D', 'Pawlowska A']","['Departments of Population Sciences and Supportive Care Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, City of Hope.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope.', 'Fuller School of Psychology.', 'Department of Supportive Care Medicine, City of Hope.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope.', 'Department of Pediatrics, City of Hope.', 'Department of Pediatrics, City of Hope.', 'Department of Pediatrics, City of Hope.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Pediatr Psychol,Journal of pediatric psychology,7801773,,IM,"['*Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms', 'Parenting', 'Parents', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of Life', 'Schools']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Latino', '*chemotherapy', '*health-related quality of life', '*leukemia', '*neurocognitive dysfunction']",2020/08/01 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['5879197 [pii]', '10.1093/jpepsy/jsaa048 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Psychol. 2020 Sep 1;45(8):921-932. doi: 10.1093/jpepsy/jsaa048.,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

From clinical evaluations among young adult survivors of childhood cancer we aimed to (1) investigate the association between accompaniment and the survivors' health complexity; and (2) determine whether accompaniment is associated with adherence to recommended surveillance tests and follow-up in clinic. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of all patients >/= 18 years old at their first visit to the regional Yale Childhood Cancer Survivorship Clinic from 2003 to 2018. Patients underwent standardized evaluations for medical, neurocognitive, and emotional late effects of therapy; individuals accompanying patients were documented. RESULTS: The 168 patients were a median of 12.0 (range: 0-17.9) years at diagnosis and 22.7 (range: 18.1-39.9) years at evaluation, and 45.8% were accompanied by a parent. In multivariable analyses, 18.0-24.99 years vs. 25.0-39.99 years at visit (OR = 3.43, p = 0.022) and central nervous system (CNS) tumor diagnosis (OR = 6.09 vs. leukemia/lymphoma diagnosis, p = 0.010) were significantly associated with parental accompaniment. Accompaniment was not associated with number and severity of medical late effects, neurocognitive impairment, or emotional distress. Accompaniment was not associated with completed surveillance tests or a clinic follow-up within 2 years. CONCLUSION: Forty-six percent of survivors were accompanied by a parent, and accompaniment was not associated with survivor health status. Accompaniment was not associated with adherence to recommended surveillance tests or clinic follow-up.","['Janardan, Sanyukta K', 'Balsamo, Lyn M', 'Ross, Wilhelmenia L', 'Rotatori, Jaime', 'Auerbach, Claudia', 'Kadan-Lottick, Nina S']","['Janardan SK', 'Balsamo LM', 'Ross WL', 'Rotatori J', 'Auerbach C', 'Kadan-Lottick NS']","['Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Yale School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University School of Medicine/Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA."", 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Yale School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Yale School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Yale School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Yale School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Yale School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA. nina.kadan-lottick@yale.edu.', 'Yale Cancer Center, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA. nina.kadan-lottick@yale.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/therapy', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Survivorship']",['NOTNLM'],"['Child', 'Neoplasms', 'Parents', 'Survivorship', 'Young adults']",2020/08/01 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-020-05653-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-020-05653-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2021 Mar;29(3):1565-1573. doi: 10.1007/s00520-020-05653-0.

METHODS: Dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9) is an enzyme in the dipeptidyl peptidase IV family that has been reported to increase drug sensitivity in acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, we examined the relationship between DPP9 expression and the prognosis of patients with CRC, as well as the role of DPP9 in anticancer drug resistance. Moreover, the effects of the DPP9 inhibitors talabostat and vildagliptin in CRC cell lines and primary cultured cells were assessed. RESULTS: High expression of DPP9 was associated with worse prognosis in 196 patients with CRC. Cell viability was markedly inhibited in CRC cell lines transfected with DPP9 small interfering RNA or small hairpin RNA. Talabostat suppressed proliferation in CRC cell lines and primary cultured cells, and increased their sensitivity to chemotherapy. Vildagliptin, a DPP family inhibitor currently administered for diabetes, also increased the sensitivity of CRC cells to anticancer drugs. CONCLUSION: DPP9 was a poor prognostic factor for CRC and could be a new therapeutic target, while vildagliptin could be used as a repositioned drug for CRC treatment.","['Saso, Kazuhiro', 'Miyoshi, Norikatsu', 'Fujino, Shiki', 'Sasaki, Masaru', 'Yasui, Masayoshi', 'Ohue, Masayuki', 'Ogino, Takayuki', 'Takahashi, Hidekazu', 'Uemura, Mamoru', 'Matsuda, Chu', 'Mizushima, Tsunekazu', 'Doki, Yuichiro', 'Eguchi, Hidetoshi']","['Saso K', 'Miyoshi N', 'Fujino S', 'Sasaki M', 'Yasui M', 'Ohue M', 'Ogino T', 'Takahashi H', 'Uemura M', 'Matsuda C', 'Mizushima T', 'Doki Y', 'Eguchi H']","['Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan. nmiyoshi@gesurg.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Osaka International Cancer Institute, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Osaka International Cancer Institute, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Surg Oncol,Annals of surgical oncology,9420840,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.4.14.- (DPP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.14.- (Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', '*Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', '*Dipeptidyl-Peptidases and Tripeptidyl-Peptidases/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Prognosis']",,,2020/08/01 06:00,2021/04/02 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1245/s10434-020-08729-7 [doi]', '10.1245/s10434-020-08729-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Surg Oncol. 2020 Oct;27(11):4337-4347. doi: 10.1245/s10434-020-08729-7.

Blood samples from 26 pregnant females with RF were collected for complete blood counts (BCC), renal/hepatic biochemistry and glycaemic analysis. Ultrasonography was performed to evaluate gestational age and foetal viability. When possible, placentas, humours and foetal tissues were collected. Blood samples were tested by PCR and qPCR for feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline alphaherpesvirus 1 (FeHV-1) and carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (CPPV-1). All maternal samples were negative for FeLV, FIV and FeHV-1 and positive for CPPV-1. In addition, foetuses from one queen and three females were positive for CPPV-1 by qPCR and for feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) through DNA sequencing.

The single-nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) technique has gained popularity due to its improved resolution compared to that of metaphase cytogenetic (MC) analysis. Methods: A total of 376 individuals were recruited from two medical centers in China, including 350 patients and 26 healthy individuals. Among these patients, 200 were diagnosed with de novo MDS, 25 with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), 63 with primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 62 with idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS). We evaluated the significance of abnormal chromosomes detected by SNP-A in the diagnosis and prognosis of MDS-related disorders. Results: (1) When certain chromosomal abnormalities could not be detected by conventional MC methods, these abnormalities could be detected more efficiently by the SNP-A method. With SNP-A, the detection rates of submicroscopic or cryptic aberrations in the MDS, MPN, and AML patients with normal MC findings were 32.8, 30.8, and 30%, respectively. (2) The chromosomal abnormalities detected by SNP-A had a very important value for the prognosis of patients with MDSs, especially in the low-risk group. The survival of patients with abnormal chromosomes detected by SNP-A was significantly lower than that of patients with no detected chromosomal abnormalities; this difference was observed in overall survival (OS) (P = 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) [24 months vs. not reach (NR); P = 0.008]. The patients with multiple chromosomal abnormalities detected by SNP-A had an inferior prognosis, and SNP-A abnormalities (>/=3 per patient) were found to be an independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with MDSs [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.40, P = 0.002]. (3) Patients with ICUS may progress to myeloid malignancies, but most patients often maintain a stable ICUS status for many years without progression. An ICUS patient found to have an MDS-related karyotype would be rediagnosed with MDS. SNP-A can efficiently detect chromosomal abnormalities, which would be important for assessing the evolution of ICUS. In our study, 17 ICUS patients with SNP-A-detected abnormalities developed typical MDSs. Conclusions: SNP-A can help evaluate the prognosis of patients with MDSs and better assess the risk of disease progression for patients with ICUS.","['Xiao, Xia', 'He, Xiaoyuan', 'Li, Qing', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Zhu, Haibo', 'Yang, Weihong', 'Li, Yuming', 'Geng, Li', 'Liu, Hui', 'Li, Lijuan', 'Wang, Huaquan', 'Fu, Rong', 'Zhao, Mingfeng', 'Chen, Zhong', 'Shao, Zonghong']","['Xiao X', 'He X', 'Li Q', 'Zhang W', 'Zhu H', 'Yang W', 'Li Y', 'Geng L', 'Liu H', 'Li L', 'Wang H', 'Fu R', 'Zhao M', 'Chen Z', 'Shao Z']","['Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Nankai University School of Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Wuhan Kindstar Diagnostics Co./Kindstar Global Gene (Beijing) Technology, Inc., Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin First Central Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Nankai University School of Medicine, Tianjin, China.', 'Wuhan Kindstar Diagnostics Co./Kindstar Global Gene (Beijing) Technology, Inc., Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chromosome aberrations', 'idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS)', 'myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)', 'prognosis', 'single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)']",2020/08/01 06:00,2020/08/01 06:01,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00962 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jul 7;10:962. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00962. eCollection 2020.,,20200707,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Xiao, He, Li, Zhang, Zhu, Yang, Li, Geng, Liu, Li, Wang, Fu,', 'Zhao, Chen and Shao.']",,PMC7358551,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a 53-year-old female patient who started with SMM which turned into multiple myeloma after four years. Despite 26 cycles of lenalidomide treatment, we performed the second autologous stem transplantation. After 12 years from the diagnosis of the disease, it was transformed into plasma cell leukemia and widespread nodular lesions were seen in the liver. Different presentations could be seen due to malignant plasma cell infiltrations or primary amyloidosis. Liver involvement is one of them and is less common than other organ involvement. We report a case of myeloma presenting with extensive nodular involvement in the liver and misdiagnosed as metastatic disease.

Anti-cancer drugs have also often proven beneficial for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In this review, we report on challenging examples that bridge between treatment of cancer and immune-mediated diseases, addressing mechanisms and experimental models as well as clinical investigations. Patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) (humanized) mouse models represent useful tools for preclinical evaluation of new therapies and biomarker identification. However, new developments using human ex vivo approaches modeling cancer, for example in microfluidic human organs-on-chips, promise to identify key molecular, cellular and immunological features of human cancer progression in a fully human setting. Classical drugs which bridge the gap, for instance, include cytotoxic drugs, proteasome inhibitors, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and metabolic inhibitors. Biologicals developed for cancer therapy have also shown efficacy in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In immune oncology, redirected chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have achieved spectacular remissions in refractory B cell leukemia and lymphoma and are currently under development for tolerance induction using cell-based therapies such as CAR Tregs or NK cells. Finally, a brief outline will be given of the lessons learned from bridging cancer and autoimmune diseases as well as tolerance induction.","['Kloss, Stephan', 'Dehmel, Susann', 'Braun, Armin', 'Parnham, Michael J', 'Kohl, Ulrike', 'Schiffmann, Susanne']","['Kloss S', 'Dehmel S', 'Braun A', 'Parnham MJ', 'Kohl U', 'Schiffmann S']","['Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology (IZI), Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hanover, Germany.', 'Fraunhofer Institute for Toxicology and Experimental Medicine (ITEM), Hanover, Germany.', 'Fraunhofer Institute for Toxicology and Experimental Medicine (ITEM), Hanover, Germany.', 'Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME), Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence for Immune-Mediated Diseases (CIMD), Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology (IZI), Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hanover, Germany.', 'Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence for Immune-Mediated Diseases (CIMD), Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Immunology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME), Branch for Translational Medicine and Pharmacology (TMP), Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,IM,"['Animals', '*Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance/drug effects/immunology', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', '*Medical Oncology/methods/trends', '*Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*autoimmune disease', '*checkpoint inhibitors', '*chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)', '*immune tolerance', '*immunotherapy']",2020/08/01 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.01423 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Jul 8;11:1423. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.01423. eCollection 2020.,,20200708,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Kloss, Dehmel, Braun, Parnham, Kohl and Schiffmann.']",,PMC7360838,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of HHT in allergic inflammations remains unknown. Mouse model of atopic dermatitis (AD) induced by 2, 4,-dinitroflurobenzene (DNFB) and anaphylaxis employing 2,4-dinitropheny-human serum albumin (DNP-HSA) were used to examine the role of HHT in allergic inflammations. HHT inhibited in vitro allergic reactions and attenuated clinical symptoms associated with AD. DNFB induced features of allergic reactions in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL2H3) cells. HHT suppressed effect of AD on the expression of Th1/Th2 cytokines. HHT inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and passive systemic anaphylaxis. MiR-183-5p, increased by antigen stimulation, was downregulated by HHT in RBL2H3 cells. MiR-183-5p inhibitor suppressed anaphylaxis and AD. B cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1) was shown to be a direct target of miR-183-5p. BTG1 prevented antigen from inducing molecular features of in vitro allergic reactions. AD increased the expression of NF-kappaB, and NF-kappaB showed binding to the promoter sequences of miR-183-5p. NF-kappaB and miR-183 formed positive feedback to mediate in vitro allergic reactions. Thus, HHT can be an anti-allergy drug.

Besides their well-established role in leukemogenesis, MLL fusions also possess latent tumor-suppressive activity, which can be exploited as effective cancer treatment strategies using pharmacological means such as proteasome inhibitors (PIs). Here, using MLL-rearranged xenografts and MLL leukemic cells as models, we show that wild-type MLL is indispensable for the latent tumor-suppressive activity of MLL fusions. MLL dysfunction, shown as loss of the chromatin accumulation and subsequent degradation of MLL, compromises the latent tumor suppression of MLL-AF4 and is instrumental for the acquired PI resistance. Mechanistically, MLL dysfunction is caused by chronic PI treatment-induced epigenetic reprogramming through the H2Bub-ASH2L-MLL axis and can be specifically restored by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, which induce histone acetylation and recruits MLL on chromatin to promote cell cycle gene expression.

In the current dose-escalation study, BAY1436032 was orally administered to 27 mIDH1 AML subjects across 4 doses ranging from 300 to 1500 mg twice-daily. BAY1436032 exhibited a relatively short half-life and apparent non-linear pharmacokinetics after continuous dosing. Most subjects experienced only partial target inhibition as indicated by plasma R-2HG levels. BAY1436032 was safe and a maximum tolerated dose was not identified. The median treatment duration for all subjects was 3.0 months (0.49-8.5). The overall response rate was 15% (4/27; 1 CRp, 1 PR, 2 MLFS), with responding subjects experiencing a median treatment duration of 6.0 months (3.9-8.5) and robust R-2HG decreases. Thirty percent (8/27) achieved SD, with a median treatment duration of 5.5 months (3.1-7.0). Degree of R-2HG inhibition and clinical benefit did not correlate with dose. Although BAY1436032 was safe and modestly effective as monotherapy, the low overall response rate and incomplete target inhibition achieved at even the highest dose tested do not support further clinical development of this investigational agent in AML.","['Heuser, Michael', 'Palmisiano, Neil', 'Mantzaris, Ioannis', 'Mims, Alice', 'DiNardo, Courtney', 'Silverman, Lewis R', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Baldus, Claudia', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Pardee, Timothy', 'Perl, Alexander E', 'Cai, Charles', 'Kaulfuss, Stefan', 'Lagkadinou, Eleni', 'Rentzsch, Christine', 'Wagner, Markus', 'Wilkinson, Gary', 'Wu, Bingyan', 'Jeffers, Michael', 'Genvresse, Isabelle', 'Kramer, Alwin']","['Heuser M', 'Palmisiano N', 'Mantzaris I', 'Mims A', 'DiNardo C', 'Silverman LR', 'Wang ES', 'Fiedler W', 'Baldus C', 'Schwind S', 'Pardee T', 'Perl AE', 'Cai C', 'Kaulfuss S', 'Lagkadinou E', 'Rentzsch C', 'Wagner M', 'Wilkinson G', 'Wu B', 'Jeffers M', 'Genvresse I', 'Kramer A']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. heuser.michael@mh-hannover.de.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Charite University Hospital Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Section on Hematology and Oncology, Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest Baptist Health, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Pharmaceuticals Division, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Whippany, NJ, USA.', 'Pharmaceuticals Division, Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pharmaceuticals Division, Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pharmaceuticals Division, Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pharmaceuticals Division, Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pharmaceuticals Division, Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pharmaceuticals Division, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Whippany, NJ, USA.', 'Pharmaceuticals Division, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Whippany, NJ, USA.', 'Pharmaceuticals Division, Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Clinical Cooperation Unit Molecular Hematology/Oncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAY 1436032)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

We find that therapeutic targeting of GLI transcription factors by GANT-61 is particularly effective against NOTCH1 unmutated T-ALL cells. Investigation of the functional role of GLI1 disclosed that it contributes to T-ALL cell proliferation, survival, and dissemination through the modulation of AKT and CXCR4 signaling pathways. Decreased CXCR4 signaling following GLI1 inactivation was found to be prevalently due to post-transcriptional mechanisms including altered serine 339 CXCR4 phosphorylation and cortactin levels. We also identify a novel cross-talk between GLI transcription factors and FOXC1. Indeed, GLI factors can activate the expression of FOXC1 which is able to stabilize GLI1/2 protein levels through attenuation of their ubiquitination. Further, we find that prolonged GLI1 deficiency has a double-edged role in T-ALL progression favoring disease dissemination through the activation of a putative AKT/FOXC1/GLI2 axis. These findings have clinical significance as T-ALL patients with extensive central nervous system dissemination show low GLI1 transcript levels. Further, T-ALL patients having a GLI2-based Hedgehog activation signature are associated with poor survival. Together, these findings support a rationale for targeting the FOXC1/AKT axis to prevent GLI-dependent oncogenic Hedgehog signaling.","['Tosello, Valeria', 'Bongiovanni, Deborah', 'Liu, Jingjing', 'Pan, Qingfei', 'Yan, Koon-Kiu', 'Saccomani, Valentina', 'Van Trimpont, Maaike', 'Pizzi, Marco', 'Mazzoni, Martina', 'Dei Tos, Angelo Paolo', 'Amadori, Alberto', 'Zanovello, Paola', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter', 'Yu, Jiyang', 'Piovan, Erich']","['Tosello V', 'Bongiovanni D', 'Liu J', 'Pan Q', 'Yan KK', 'Saccomani V', 'Van Trimpont M', 'Pizzi M', 'Mazzoni M', 'Dei Tos AP', 'Amadori A', 'Zanovello P', 'Van Vlierberghe P', 'Yu J', 'Piovan E']","['UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italia.', ""Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita' di Padova, Padova, Italia."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita' di Padova, Padova, Italia."", 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Surgical Pathology & Cytopathology Unit, Department of Medicine - DIMED, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italia.', 'Surgical Pathology & Cytopathology Unit, Department of Medicine - DIMED, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italia.', ""Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita' di Padova, Padova, Italia."", ""Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita' di Padova, Padova, Italia."", 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto IOV-IRCCS, Padova, Italia. erich.piovan@unipd.it.', ""Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Universita' di Padova, Padova, Italia. erich.piovan@unipd.it.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (FOXC1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (GLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Hedgehog Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/etiology/*metabolism/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1/*metabolism']",,,2020/08/01 06:00,2021/05/01 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0999-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0999-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Apr;35(4):984-1000. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0999-2.

METHODS: Prospective observational study conducted at a single center. All patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmological examination, before and after HSCT, including slitlamp examination, Schirmer test, tear breakup time, ocular surface staining, specular microscopy of corneal endothelium, and Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients undergoing HSCT and 25 age- and sex-matched controls were included. At baseline, hematological patients showed significantly lower values of endothelial cell density (ECD) compared with those of controls (2514.5 +/- 390.2 vs. 2723.7 +/- 298.0 cells/mm, P = 0.038). After HSCT, ocular surface disease index score significantly increased (P = 0.020) and tear breakup time significantly decreased (P = 0.036). Conversely, no significant changes were found in Schirmer test and corneal fluorescein staining (always P > 0.05). Eight patients (32%) developed ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). ECD values significantly decreased after HSCT (from 2514.5 +/- 390.2 to 2409.5 +/- 330.9 cells/mm, P = 0.009). The decrease in ECD values after HSCT was more pronounced in patients with ocular GVHD compared with those without (231.1 +/- 188.8 vs. 45.6 +/- 156.5, P = 0.016). No significant correlations between the changes in ECD and hematological and ocular characteristics were found (always P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Hematological patients showed a lower endothelial cell count already before HSCT, compared with controls. After HSCT, the endothelial cell count further significantly decreased, particularly in patients who developed ocular GVHD.","['Pellegrini, Marco', 'Giannaccare, Giuseppe', 'Bernabei, Federico', 'Moscardelli, Fabiana', 'Sessa, Mariarosaria', 'Arpinati, Mario', 'Bonifazi, Francesca', 'Versura, Piera']","['Pellegrini M', 'Giannaccare G', 'Bernabei F', 'Moscardelli F', 'Sessa M', 'Arpinati M', 'Bonifazi F', 'Versura P']","['*Ophthalmology Unit, DIMES, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna and S.Orsola-Malpighi Teaching Hospital, Bologna, Italy; daggerDepartment of Ophthalmology, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy; and double daggerHematology Unit, DIMES, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna and S.Orsola-Malpighi Teaching Hospital, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cornea,Cornea,8216186,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Count', 'Corneal Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Endothelium, Corneal/*pathology', 'Female', 'Fluorophotometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Slit Lamp Microscopy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tears/physiology']",,,2020/08/01 06:00,2021/10/30 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/ICO.0000000000002441 [doi]'],ppublish,Cornea. 2021 Apr;40(4):462-466. doi: 10.1097/ICO.0000000000002441.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the mechanisms involved in leukemic cell tissue retention we developed a 3D bone marrow (BM) microenvironment that recreates CLL - BM-stromal cells interactions inside a scaffold within a bioreactor. Our system allows the parallel analysis of CLL cells retained inside the scaffold and those released in the presence/absence of pharmacological agents, mimicking tissue and circulating cell compartments, respectively. CLL cells can be retained within the scaffold only in the presence of microenvironmental elements, which through direct contact down-regulate the expression of HS1 cytoskeletal protein in CLL cells. Consist with this, the expression of HS1 was lower in CLL cells obtained from patients' BM versus CLL cells circulating in the PB. Moreover, we demonstrate that CLL cells with inactive-HS1, impaired cytoskeletal activity and a more aggressive phenotype are more likely retained within the scaffold despite the presence of Ibrutinib, whose mobilizing effect is mainly exerted on those with active-HS1, ensuing dynamic cytoskeletal activity. This differential effect would not otherwise be assessable in a traditional 2D system and may underlie a distinctive resistance of single CLL clones. Notably, CLL cells mobilized in the peripheral blood of patients during Ibrutinib therapy exhibited activated HS1, underscoring that our model reliably mirrors the in vivo situation. The 3D model described herein is suitable to reproduce and identify critical CLL-BM interactions, opening the way to pathophysiological studies and the evaluation of novel targeted therapies in an individualized manner.","['Barbaglio, Federica', 'Belloni, Daniela', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Sbrana, Francesca Vittoria', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Bongiovanni, Lucia', 'Pavesi, Luca', 'Zambroni, Desiree', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Caiolfa, Valeria R', 'Ferrero, Elisabetta', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Scielzo, Cristina']","['Barbaglio F', 'Belloni D', 'Scarfo L', 'Sbrana FV', 'Ponzoni M', 'Bongiovanni L', 'Pavesi L', 'Zambroni D', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Caiolfa VR', 'Ferrero E', 'Ghia P', 'Scielzo C']","['IIRCCS, Ospedale San Raffaele, Division of Experimental Oncology, Milan Italy.', 'IRCCS, Ospedale San Raffaele, Division of Experimental Oncology, Milan Italy.', 'IRCCS, Ospedale San Raffaele, Division of Experimental Oncology, Milan Italy.', 'IRCCS, Ospedale San Raffaele, Division of Experimental Oncology, Milan Italy.', 'IRCCS, Ospedale San Raffaele, Pathology Unit, Milan Italy.', 'IRCCS, Ospedale San Raffaele, Pathology Unit, Milan Italy.', 'IRCCS, Ospedale San Raffaele, Division of Experimental Oncology, Milan Italy.', 'IRCCS, Ospedale San Raffaele, Centre for Experimental Imaging, Milan Italy.', 'Hematology Department and HCT Unit, G.

We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib as single agent, in a real-life context, on 180 patients with CLL mostly pre-treated, recruited from three independent cohorts from Italy. Patients received 420 mg oral ibrutinib once daily until progression or occurrence of unacceptable side effects. Seventy-three patients discontinued ibrutinib for progression or for adverse events. NOTCH1 mutations (M) were correlated with a reduced redistribution lymphocytosis, calculated at 3 months on ibrutinib (p=0.022). Moreover, NOTCH1 mutated patients showed inferior nodal response at 6 months on ibrutinib compared to NOTCH1 wild type patients (p<0.0001). Significant shorter progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed in NOTCH1 mutated patients (p=0.00002 and p=0.001). Interestingly, NOTCH1 M plus lower bax/bcl-2 ratio identified a CLL subset showing the worst PFS and OS (p=0.0002 and p=0.005). In multivariate analysis of PFS and OS, NOTCH1 M were confirmed an independent prognosticator (p=0.00006 and p=0.0039). In conclusion, NOTCH1 M are strongly associated with lower bax/bcl-2 ratio, consistent with a defective apoptosis, lower redistribution lymphocytosis and lower nodal shrinkage under ibrutinib treatment, this last responsible for partial responses, subsequent relapses, shorter PFS and OS. The therapeutic options for NOTCH1 mutated patients could be represented by either new small molecules combination approaches or from antibodies targeting NOTCH1.","['Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Biagi, Annalisa', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Chiarenza, Annalisa', 'Pozzo, Federico', 'Innocenti, Idanna', 'Postorino, Massimiliano', 'Rossi, Francesca Maria', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'de Fabritiis, Paolo', 'Bruno, Antonio', 'Cantonetti, Maria', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Zucchetto, Antonella', 'Gattei, Valter']","['Del Poeta G', 'Biagi A', 'Laurenti L', 'Chiarenza A', 'Pozzo F', 'Innocenti I', 'Postorino M', 'Rossi FM', 'Del Principe MI', 'Bomben R', 'de Fabritiis P', 'Bruno A', 'Cantonetti M', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Zucchetto A', 'Gattei V']","['Hematology, Dept of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Dept of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', ""Division of Hematology, Universita' Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy."", 'Division of Hematology, Ferrarotto Hospital, Catania, Italy.', 'Cinical and Experimental Hematology Unit, CRO, IRCCS, Aviano (PN), Italy.', ""Division of Hematology, Universita' Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy."", 'Hematology, Dept of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Cinical and Experimental Hematology Unit, CRO, IRCCS, Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Hematology, Dept of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Cinical and Experimental Hematology Unit, CRO, IRCCS, Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Hematology, Dept of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Dept of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Dept of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Ospedale Ferrarotto.', 'Cinical and Experimental Hematology Unit, CRO, IRCCS, Aviano (PN), Italy.', 'Cinical and Experimental Hematology Unit, CRO, IRCCS, Aviano (PN), Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Apoptosis', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2020/08/01 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2020.251488 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2020.251488 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Sep 1;106(9):2345-2353. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.251488.,,20210901,,,,PMC8409042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constitutive activation of Janus kinase-2 (JAK2) in the majority of MF patients contributes to the expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD1) and T-cell exhaustion. We wondered whether T-cell activation affects treatment outcome of patients with MF and sought to determine whether the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib affects the activation of T-cell subsets. T cells from 47 MF patients were analyzed and the percent of either helper (CD4+) or cytotoxic (CD8+) naive, central memory, effector memory, or effector T cells; and fractions of PD1-expressing cells in each subset were assessed. An increased number of T cells coexpressing CD4/PD1 and CD8/PD1 in MF compared to healthy controls (n=28) was found, and the T cells were significantly skewed toward an effector phenotype in both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, consistent with a shift from a quiescent to an activated state. Over the course of ruxolitinib treatment, the distribution of aberrant T-cell subsets significantly reversed towards resting cell phenotypes. CD4+ and CD8+ subsets at baseline correlated with monocyte and platelet counts, and their PD1-positive fractions correlated with leukocyte counts and spleen size. Low numbers of PD1+/CD4+ and PD1+/CD8+ cells were associated with complete resolution of palpable splenomegaly and improved survival rate, suggesting that low levels of exhausted T cells confer a favorable response to ruxolitinib treatment.","['Veletic, Ivo', 'Prijic, Sanja', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Nogueras-Gonzalez, Graciela M', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Veletic I', 'Prijic S', 'Manshouri T', 'Nogueras-Gonzalez GM', 'Verstovsek S', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cytokines', 'Humans', '*Primary Myelofibrosis/drug therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2020/08/01 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2020.249441 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2020.249441 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Sep 1;106(9):2384-2396. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.249441.,,20210901,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC8409049,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook a perspective study using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of clinical follow-up samples (n=91) from 23 patients with AML with therapeutic failure to cytarabine plus idarubicin or fludarabine. Cases of primary refractoriness to treatment were associated with a lower number of DNA variants at diagnosis than cases of relapse (median 1.67 and 3.21, respectively, p=0.029). The most frequently affected pathways in patients with primary refractoriness were signaling, transcription and tumor suppression, whereas methylation and splicing pathways were mainly implicated in relapsed patients. New therapeutic targets, either by an approved drug or within clinical trials, were not identified in any of the cases of refractoriness (0/10); however, 8 potential new targets were found in 5 relapsed patients (5/13) (p=0.027): 1 IDH2, 3 SF3B1, 2 KRAS, 1 KIT and 1 JAK2. Sixty-five percent of all variants detected at diagnosis were not detected at complete response (CR). Specifically, 100% of variants in EZH2, RUNX1, VHL, FLT3, ETV6, U2AF1, PHF6 and SF3B1 disappeared at CR, indicating their potential use as markers to evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) for follow-up of AML. Molecular follow-up using a custom NGS myeloid panel of 32 genes in the post-treatment evaluation of AML can help in the stratification of prognostic risk, the selection of MRD markers to monitor the response to treatment and guide post-remission strategies targeting AML, and the selection of new drugs for leukemia relapse.","['Onecha, Esther', 'Rapado, Inmaculada', 'Luz Morales, Maria', 'Carreno-Tarragona, Gonzalo', 'Martinez-Sanchez, Pilar', 'Gutierrez, Xabier', 'Sachez Pina, Jose Maria', 'Linares, Maria', 'Gallardo, Miguel', 'Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin', 'Ayala, Rosa']","['Onecha E', 'Rapado I', 'Luz Morales M', 'Carreno-Tarragona G', 'Martinez-Sanchez P', 'Gutierrez X', 'Sachez Pina JM', 'Linares M', 'Gallardo M', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Ayala R']","['Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)'],IM,"['Clonal Evolution/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",,,2020/08/01 06:00,2021/10/28 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2020.254623 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2020.254623 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Sep 1;106(9):2325-2333. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.254623.,,20210901,,,,PMC8409047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant molecular responses were achieved within 3-6 months in 81% of patients with phenotypic driver mutations in JAK2, CALR and MPL. Here, we investigated the dynamics of additional somatic mutations in response to imetelstat. At study entry, 50% of patients carried 1-5 additional mutations in the genes ASXL1, CBL, DNMT3A, EZH2, IDH1, SF3B1, TET2, TP53 and U2AF1. Three patients with baseline mutations also had late-emerging mutations in TP53, IDH1 and TET2. Most clones with additional mutations were responsive to imetelstat and decreased with the driver mutation, including the poor prognostic ASXL1, EZH2 and U2AF1 mutations while SF3B1 and TP53 mutations were associated with poorer molecular response. Overall, phenotypic driver mutation response was significantly deeper in patients without additional mutations (P = 0.04) and correlated with longer duration of response. In conclusion, this detailed molecular analysis of highly pretreated and partly resistant patients with essential thrombocythemia reveals a high individual patient complexity. Moreover, imetelstat demonstrates potential to inhibit efficiently co-incident mutations occurring in neoplastic clones in patients with essential thrombocythemia.

BRCA1 is critical for homologous recombination of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). Through its coiled-coil domain, BRCA1 interacts with an essential partner, PALB2, recruiting BRCA2 and RAD51 to sites of DNA damage. Missense mutations within the coiled-coil domain of BRCA1 (e.g., L1407P) that affect the interaction with PALB2 have been reported in familial breast cancer. We hypothesized that if PALB2 regulates or mediates BRCA1 tumor suppressor function, ablation of the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction may also elicit genomic instability and tumor susceptibility. We generated mice defective for the Brca1-Palb2 interaction (Brca1 L1363P in mice) and established MEF cells from these mice. Brca1 (L1363P/L1363P) MEF exhibited hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and failed to recruit Rad51 to DSB. Brca1 (L1363P/L1363P) mice were viable but exhibited various FA symptoms including growth retardation, hyperpigmentation, skeletal abnormalities, and male/female infertility. Furthermore, all Brca1 (L1363P/L1363P) mice exhibited macrocytosis and died due to bone marrow failure or lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia with activating Notch1 mutations. These phenotypes closely recapitulate clinical features observed in patients with FA. Collectively, this model effectively demonstrates the significance of the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction in genome integrity and provides an FA model to investigate hematopoietic stem cells for mechanisms underlying progressive failure of hematopoiesis and associated development of leukemia/lymphoma, and other FA phenotypes. SIGNIFICANCE: A new Brca1 mouse model for Fanconi anemia (FA) complementation group S provides a system in which to study phenotypes observed in human FA patients including bone marrow failure.See related commentary by Her and Bunting, p. 4044.","['Park, Dongju', 'Bergin, Stephen M', 'Jones, Dan', 'Ru, Peng', 'Koivisto, Christopher S', 'Jeon, Young-Jun', 'Sizemore, Gina M', 'Kladney, Raleigh D', 'Hadjis, Ashley', 'Shakya, Reena', 'Ludwig, Thomas']","['Park D', 'Bergin SM', 'Jones D', 'Ru P', 'Koivisto CS', 'Jeon YJ', 'Sizemore GM', 'Kladney RD', 'Hadjis A', 'Shakya R', 'Ludwig T']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.

Glucarpidase can quickly reduce extracellular methotrexate to safe levels, but the effectiveness and safety of its use in different episodes of nephrotoxicity remain an unknown area. CASE REPORT: A 30-year-old male diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic T-cell lymphoma received methotrexate 5 g/m2 intravenous (IV) as part of the first consolidation cycle. On Consolidation 3, he restarted methotrexate at a dose of 3 g/m2 IV showing slow methotrexate elimination, associated myelosuppression, and hepatic toxicity. Glucarpidase was administered (total dose of 2000 International Units (IU)). No adverse events were observed, and his renal function returned to normal. One hundred and six days later, he was diagnosed with leptomeningeal and cerebellar relapse and treatment with methotrexate 3,5 g/m2 IV day 1 and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) 2 g/m2 IV twice per day days 1, 3, and 5 was started. At 36 h from methotrexate infusion, serum creatinine increased up to 1.89 mg/dL and methotrexate concentration was 100 micromol/L.Management and Outcome: Ara-C was suspended, and a second administration of glucarpidase (2000 IU) was dispensed. No adverse events were noticed, methotrexate levels decreased and renal function progressively improved, recovering completely three weeks later. DISCUSSION: The effectiveness and safety of the use of glucarpidase in different episodes of nephrotoxicity remain an unknown area, and the rate and consequences of antiglucarpidase antibody formation remain poorly understood. This case report is, to our knowledge, the first case of a second administration of glucarpidase in a different cycle of high-dose methotrexate in an adult patient.","['Domingo-Gonzalez, Amalia', 'Osorio, Santiago', 'Landete, Elena', 'Monsalvo, Silvia', 'Diez-Martin, Jose L']","['Domingo-Gonzalez A', 'Osorio S', 'Landete E', 'Monsalvo S', 'Diez-Martin JL']","['Hematology Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '2GFP9BJD79 (glucarpidase)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/chemically induced', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Methotrexate-induced kidney injury', 'glucarpidase', 'glucarpidase/additional doses', 'glucarpidase/safety', 'methotrexate toxicity']",2020/08/01 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155220946464 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Apr;27(3):734-738. doi: 10.1177/1078155220946464.

We hypothesized that culturing mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) under simulated microgravity (SMG) conditions in rotary bioreactors (BRs) will enhance the induction of directed DE differentiation. To test our hypothesis, we cultured the cells for 6 days in two-dimensional monolayer colony cultures or as embryoid bodies (EBs) in either static conditions or, dynamically, in the rotary BRs. We used flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to analyze the expression of marker proteins and genes, respectively, for pluripotency (Oct3/4) and mesendodermal (Brachyury T), endodermal (FoxA2, Sox17, CxCr4), and mesodermal (Vimentin, Meox1) lineages. Culture in the form of EBs in maintenance media in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor, in static or SMG conditions, induced expression of some of the differentiation markers, suggesting heterogeneity of the cells. This is in line with previous studies showing that differentiation is initiated as cells are aggregated into EBs even without supplementing differentiation factors to the media. Culturing EBs in static conditions in differentiation media (DM) in the presence of activin A reduced Oct3/4 expression and significantly increased Brachyury T and CxCr4 expression, but downregulated FoxA2 and Sox17. However, culturing in SMG BRs in DM upregulated Brachyury T and all of the DE markers and reduced Oct3/4 expression, indicating the advantage of dynamic cultures in BRs to specifically enhance directed DE differentiation. Given the potential discrepancies between the SMG conditions on earth and actual microgravity conditions, as observed in other studies, future experiments in space flight are required to validate the effects of reduced gravity on mESC differentiation.","['Oss-Ronen, Liat', 'Redden, Robert A', 'Lelkes, Peter I']","['Oss-Ronen L', 'Redden RA', 'Lelkes PI']","['Department of Bioengineering, College of Engineering, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, College of Engineering, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Bioengineering, College of Engineering, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryoid Bodies/cytology', 'Endoderm/*cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', '*Weightlessness Simulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['*definitive endoderm', '*mouse embryonic stem cells', '*simulated microgravity']",2020/08/01 06:00,2021/09/04 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2020.0097 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2020 Oct 1;29(19):1275-1284. doi: 10.1089/scd.2020.0097.

Therefore, innovative or additional approaches are necessary to overcome refractoriness to the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect immediately after allo-SCT. AREAS COVERED: Hypomethylating agents (HMA) present a feasible option that can be adopted during the post-transplant phase. Moreover, combination strategies based on HMA may induce a synergistic effect by promoting anti-leukemic effects that overcome residual leukemic burden, and it is a well-tolerated therapeutic option for high-risk disease. Relevant literatures published in the last 30 years were searched from PubMed to review the topic of AML, allo-SCT, and HMAs. EXPERT OPINION: Post-transplant therapy is strongly needed to improve the outcomes of allogeneic transplantation for certain AML patients classified with high-risk disease. In that sense, prophylactic and preemptive HMAs are a promising additive therapy for allogeneic recipients.","['Baek, Dong Won', 'Kim, Juhyung', 'Cho, Hee Jeong', 'Moon, Joon Ho', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun']","['Baek DW', 'Kim J', 'Cho HJ', 'Moon JH', 'Sohn SK']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University , Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University , Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University , Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University , Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University , Daegu, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Postoperative Care', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*High-risk', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*hypomethylating agent', '*minimal residual disease']",2020/08/01 06:00,2021/05/27 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2020.1804355 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2020 Sep;13(9):959-969. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2020.1804355.

Furthermore, mounting evidence highlights the anti-tumor activity of this compound. Notably, oral administration of ATRA is the first choice treatment in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) in adults and NeuroBlastoma (NB) in children. Regrettably, the promising results obtained for these diseases have not been translated yet into the clinics for solid tumors. This is mainly due to ATRA-resistance developed by cancer cells and to ineffective delivery and targeting.

To counteract this, cells have evolved a tightly regulated DNA damage response (DDR) to rapidly sense DNA damage and promote its repair whilst halting cell cycle progression. The DDR functions predominantly within the context of chromatin and requires the action of chromatin-binding proteins to coordinate the appropriate response. TRIM24, TRIM28, TRIM33 and TRIM66 make up the transcriptional intermediary factor 1 (TIF1) family of chromatin-binding proteins, a subfamily of the large tripartite motif (TRIM) family of E3 ligases. All four TIF1 proteins are aberrantly expressed across numerous cancer types, and increasing evidence suggests that TIF1 family members can function to maintain genome stability by mediating chromatin-based responses to DNA damage. This review provides an overview of the TIF1 family in cancer, focusing on their roles in DNA repair, chromatin regulation and cell cycle regulation.","['McAvera, Roisin M', 'Crawford, Lisa J']","['McAvera RM', 'Crawford LJ']","[""Patrick G Johnston Centre for Cancer Research, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast BT9 7AE, UK."", ""Patrick G Johnston Centre for Cancer Research, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast BT9 7AE, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage', 'TRIM24', 'TRIM28', 'TRIM33', 'TRIM66', 'cancer', 'genome stability']",2020/08/01 06:00,2020/08/01 06:01,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12082094 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12082094 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jul 28;12(8). pii: cancers12082094. doi: 10.3390/cancers12082094.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1222-3047'],20200728,,,['R2418CNR/Leukaemia and Lymphoma NI'],PMC7463590,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The apoptotic regulation is mediated through the binding of pro-apoptotic peptides (PAPs) (e.g., Bak and Bid) at the canonical hydrophobic binding groove (CBG) of Mcl1. Although all PAPs form amphipathic alpha-helices, their amino acid sequences vary to different degree. This sequence variation exhibits a central role in the binding partner selectivity towards different AAPs. Thus, constructing a novel peptide or small organic molecule with the ability to mimic the natural regulatory process of PAP is essential to inhibit various AAPs. Previously reported experimental binding free energies (BFEs) were utilized in the current investigation aimed to understand the mechanistic basis of different PAPs targeted to mMcl1. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations used to estimate BFEs between mMcl1-PAP complexes using Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Solvent Accessible (MMGBSA) approach with multiple parameters. Predicted BFE values showed an excellent agreement with the experiment (R(2) = 0.92). The van-der Waals (DeltaGvdw) and electrostatic (DeltaGele) energy terms found to be the main energy components that drive heterodimerization of mMcl1-PAP complexes. Finally, the dynamic network analysis predicted the allosteric signal transmission pathway involves more favorable energy contributing residues. In total, the results obtained from the current investigation may provide valuable insights for the synthesis of a novel peptide or small organic inhibitor targeting Mcl1.","['Marimuthu, Parthiban', 'Razzokov, Jamoliddin', 'Singaravelu, Kalaimathy', 'Bogaerts, Annemie']","['Marimuthu P', 'Razzokov J', 'Singaravelu K', 'Bogaerts A']","['Structural Bioinformatics Laboratory (SBL), Biochemistry and Pharmacy, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Abo Akademi University, FI-20520 Turku, Finland.', 'PLASMANT Research Group, Chemistry Department, University of Antwerp, 2610 Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Department of Future Technologies, Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Turku, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.', 'PLASMANT Research Group, Chemistry Department, University of Antwerp, 2610 Antwerp, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Biomolecules,Biomolecules,101596414,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation/*drug effects', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Peptides/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Thermodynamics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell lymphoma 2', '*allosteric-signaling pathway', '*binding free energy', '*myeloid cell leukemia', '*protein interaction network']",2020/08/01 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['biom10081114 [pii]', '10.3390/biom10081114 [doi]']",epublish,Biomolecules. 2020 Jul 28;10(8). pii: biom10081114. doi: 10.3390/biom10081114.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4960-2160', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3098-0797', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9875-6460']",20200728,,,,PMC7463671,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, CAR-T cell immunotherapy is rapidly emerging as a new therapy. However, it has limitations that prevent consistency in therapeutic effects in solid tumors, which accounts for over 90% of all cancer patients. Here, we review the literature regarding various obstacles to CAR-T cell immunotherapy for solid tumors, including those that cause CAR-T cell dysfunction in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, such as reactive oxygen species, pH, O2, immunosuppressive cells, cytokines, and metabolites, as well as those that impair cell trafficking into the tumor microenvironment. Next-generation CAR-T cell therapy is currently undergoing clinical trials to overcome these challenges. Therefore, novel approaches to address the challenges faced by CAR-T cell immunotherapy in solid tumors are also discussed here.","['Jo, Yuna', 'Ali, Laraib Amir', 'Shim, Ju A', 'Lee, Byung Ha', 'Hong, Changwan']","['Jo Y', 'Ali LA', 'Shim JA', 'Lee BH', 'Hong C']","['Department of Anatomy, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan 50612, Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan 50612, Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan 50612, Korea.', 'NeoImmuneTech, Inc., 2400 Research Blvd., Suite 250, Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'Department of Anatomy, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan 50612, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR-T', 'T cell responses', 'immunotherapy', 'solid tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",2020/08/01 06:00,2020/08/01 06:01,['2020/08/01 06:00'],"['2020/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12082087 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12082087 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jul 28;12(8). pii: cancers12082087. doi: 10.3390/cancers12082087.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5756-4873', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4664-718X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2567-2973']",20200728,,,['2-Year Research Grant of Pusan National University/Pusan National University'],PMC7464778,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains unclear whether any molecular alteration is correlated with the therapeutic effect of such treatment regimens. METHODS: Gene mutations were detected using next-generation sequencing, and their impact on survival was investigated in elderly AML patients receiving decitabine-based chemotherapy. RESULTS: A higher incidence of gene mutations was identified in elderly AML patients than in the younger cohorts. Elderly patients more frequently carried DNMT3A, IDH2, ASXL1, TET2, RUNX1, CEBPA single mutation (CEBPA(single-mut) ), and TP53 mutations. Survival analysis showed that DNMT3A, FLT3-ITD, and TP53 mutations were associated with inferior overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in younger AML patients receiving standard treatment. However, in elderly patients treated with decitabine-based chemotherapy, FLT3-ITD, and ASXL1 mutations, but not DNMT3A and TP53 mutations, were associated with poor OS and EFS. Moreover, contrary to CEBPA double mutation (CEBPA(double-mut) ), CEBPA(single-mut) was identified as an unfavorable prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: This study comprehensively analyzed the prognostic implications of gene mutations in elderly AML patients under decitabine-based treatment modality. Identification of genetic biomarkers to predict the subgroup of elderly AML patients who can benefit from decitabine-based regimens might have an immediate clinical utility to optimize the treatment of elderly AML patients.","['Ni, Jing', 'Hong, Jian', 'Long, Zhangbiao', 'Li, Qingsheng', 'Xia, Ruixiang', 'Zeng, Qingshu']","['Ni J', 'Hong J', 'Long Z', 'Li Q', 'Xia R', 'Zeng Q']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Decitabine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'decitabine', 'elderly patients', 'gene mutation', 'prognosis']",2020/07/31 06:00,2021/02/04 06:00,['2020/07/31 06:00'],"['2020/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13299 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2020 Dec;42(6):849-857. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13299.

A close genetic effect of Trib1 on Hoxa9 has been observed in myeloid leukemogenesis, where Trib1 overexpression significantly accelerates Hoxa9-induced leukemia onset. However, the mechanism underlying how Trib1 functionally modulates Hoxa9 transcription activity is unclear. Herein, we provide evidence that Trib1 modulates Hoxa9-associated super-enhancers. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis identified increased histone H3K27Ac signals at super-enhancers of the Erg, Spns2, Rgl1, and Pik3cd loci, as well as increased messenger RNA expression of these genes. Modification of super-enhancer activity was mostly achieved via the degradation of C/EBPalpha p42 by Trib1, with a slight contribution from the MEK/ERK pathway. Silencing of Erg abrogated the growth advantage acquired by Trib1 overexpression, indicating that Erg is a critical downstream target of the Trib1/Hoxa9 axis. Moreover, treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 showed growth inhibition in a Trib1/Erg-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. Upregulation of ERG by TRIB1 was also observed in human AML cell lines, suggesting that Trib1 is a potential therapeutic target of Hoxa9-associated AML. Taken together, our study demonstrates a novel mechanism by which Trib1 modulates chromatin and Hoxa9-driven transcription in myeloid leukemogenesis.","['Yoshino, Seiko', 'Yokoyama, Takashi', 'Sunami, Yoshitaka', 'Takahara, Tomoko', 'Nakamura, Aya', 'Yamazaki, Yukari', 'Tsutsumi, Shuichi', 'Aburatani, Hiroyuki', 'Nakamura, Takuro']","['Yoshino S', 'Yokoyama T', 'Sunami Y', 'Takahara T', 'Nakamura A', 'Yamazaki Y', 'Tsutsumi S', 'Aburatani H', 'Nakamura T']","['Division of Carcinogenesis, The Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Carcinogenesis, The Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan; and.', 'Division of Carcinogenesis, The Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Carcinogenesis, The Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Carcinogenesis, The Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Carcinogenesis, The Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Genome Science Division, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Genome Science Division, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Carcinogenesis, The Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (TRIB1 protein, human)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2020/07/31 06:00,2021/04/17 06:00,['2020/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)86010-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019004586 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2021 Jan 7;137(1):75-88. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019004586.,,,,['(c) 2021 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,PMC7976434,,['Blood. 2021 Jan 7;137(1):8-9.

In particular, patients with TP53 mutations represent a distinct molecular cohort with uniformly poor prognosis. The precise pathogenetic mechanisms underlying these inferior outcomes have not been delineated. In this study, we characterized the immunological features of the malignant clone and alterations in the immune microenvironment in patients with TP53-mutant and wild-type MDS or sAML. Notably, PDL1 expression is significantly increased in hematopoietic stem cells of patients with TP53 mutations, which is associated with MYC upregulation and marked downregulation of MYC's negative regulator miR-34a, a p53 transcription target. Notably, patients with TP53 mutations display significantly reduced numbers of bone marrow-infiltrating OX40+ cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells, as well as decreased ICOS+ and 4-1BB+ natural killer cells. Further, highly immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) (ie, ICOShigh/PD-1-) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PD-1low) are expanded in cases with TP53 mutations. Finally, a higher proportion of bone marrow-infiltrating ICOShigh/PD-1- Treg cells is a highly significant independent predictor of overall survival. We conclude that the microenvironment of TP53 mutant MDS and sAML has an immune-privileged, evasive phenotype that may be a primary driver of poor outcomes and submit that immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies may offer a benefit for this molecularly defined subpopulation.","['Sallman, David A', 'McLemore, Amy F', 'Aldrich, Amy L', 'Komrokji, Rami S', 'McGraw, Kathy L', 'Dhawan, Abhishek', 'Geyer, Susan', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Eksioglu, Erika A', 'Sullivan, Amy', 'Warren, Sarah', 'MacBeth, Kyle J', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Boettcher, Steffen', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Al Ali, Najla H', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'Cleveland, John L', 'Padron, Eric', 'List, Alan F']","['Sallman DA', 'McLemore AF', 'Aldrich AL', 'Komrokji RS', 'McGraw KL', 'Dhawan A', 'Geyer S', 'Hou HA', 'Eksioglu EA', 'Sullivan A', 'Warren S', 'MacBeth KJ', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Haferlach T', 'Boettcher S', 'Ebert BL', 'Al Ali NH', 'Lancet JE', 'Cleveland JL', 'Padron E', 'List AF']","['Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

Worldwide, nonetheless, less than 10% of the CB HSCTs are performed with a match sibling donor. Since 2004, the Chilean National Childhood Cancer Program (PINDA) net work, has established a CB directed donation program for HSCT. PATIENTS AND METHOD: An obser vational, descriptive and retrospective study was designed to assess the number and characteristics of the CB units collected in the program as well as the number, clinical characteristics and follow-up of the patients who received an HSCT from those CB units between January 2004 and October 2018. RESULTS: Sixty CB units have been collected; 55 of them with full records and stored. The median volume collected was 74.8 ml (30.0-170.8), the median number of total nucleated cells was 7.6 x 10e8 (2.0-21.1), and the median of CD34+ cells was 1.6 x 10e6 (0.2-11.6). Four high-risk leukemia patients received HSCT, all of them developed severe complications after transplantation and one patient died due to relapse. Those patients currently alive have a 100% Karnofsky/Lansky score. The median follow-up time was 8 years. CONCLUSION: The PINDA program has allowed 4 patients to be transplan ted who otherwise would not have had access to a donor. This directed donation program could be seen as a model for the development of a public cord blood bank in Chile.","['Sotomayor, Cristian', 'Salas, Lucia', 'Lattus, Jose', 'Anguita-Compagnon, Alfonso T', 'Abarzua, Carolina', 'Catalan, Paula', 'Palma, Julia']","['Sotomayor C', 'Salas L', 'Lattus J', 'Anguita-Compagnon AT', 'Abarzua C', 'Catalan P', 'Palma J']","['Unidad de trasplante de Medula Osea, Hospital Dr. Luis calvo Mackenna, Santiago, Chile.', 'Unidad de trasplante de Medula Osea, Hospital Dr. Luis calvo Mackenna, Santiago, Chile.', 'Hospital Dr. Luis Tisne, Santiago, Chile.', 'Laboratorio de trasplante, Clinica Alemana de Santiago, Santiago, Chile.', 'Unidad de trasplante de Medula Osea, Hospital Dr. Luis calvo Mackenna, Santiago, Chile.', 'Unidad de trasplante de Medula Osea, Hospital Dr. Luis calvo Mackenna, Santiago, Chile.']","['eng', 'spa']","['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",Chile,Rev Chil Pediatr,Revista chilena de pediatria,0404261,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Blood Donors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chile', '*Directed Tissue Donation', 'Female', '*Fetal Blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'National Health Programs', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Siblings']",,,2020/07/31 06:00,2021/05/26 06:00,['2020/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0370-41062020005000405 [pii]', '10.32641/rchped.v91i2.1454 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Chil Pediatr. 2020 Apr;91(2):226-231. doi: 10.32641/rchped.v91i2.1454.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Donacion dirigida de sangre de Cordon Umbilical de Hermano Compatible en el Sistema de Salud Publico de Chile.,,,,,

Humoral response was evaluated by hemaglutination inhibition test (HAI) against H1N1. Patients were followed up for one year, clinical data and influenza episodes were recorded. RESULTS: 34 children with ALL and 9 healthy children were included. Concerning HAI on D28, 12/34 patients and 5/8 healthy children had titers >/= 1/40, with seroprotection rates of 35 and 63% respectively. Seroprotected children were older than non-seroprotected ones.

After receiving intravenous carboxymaltose iron in one occasion due to refractory anemia, she developed symptomatic hypophosphatemia. Urinary phosphate losses associated with high FGF23 levels were confirmed. Plasma phosphate returned to normal values 90 days after the iron administration. (ii) A 40-year-old man with a history of CML in whom imatinib was started. He developed symptomatic hypophosphatemia due to non FGF23-mediated hyperphosphaturia. As treatment with imatinib could not be interrupted, hypophosphatemia and its symptoms resolved with oral phosphate intake.

Beyond its role in APL tumorigenesis, PHRF1 contributes to non-homologous end-joining by linking H3K36 methylation and Nbs1 upon DNA damage insults. However, little is known regarding its function in tumor invasion. Here we highlight the unreported details of PHRF1 in the invasion of lung cancer cells by modulating the transcriptional level of ZEB1, a prominent regulator involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. PHRF1 associated with the phosphorylated C-terminal repeat domain of Rpb1, the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, through its C-terminal Set2 Rpb1 Interacting (SRI) domain. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that PHRF1 bound to the proximal region adjacent to the transcription start site of ZEB1.

Subsequently, a severe and novel pediatric disorder termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) emerged. We report on unique hematologic and immunologic parameters that distinguish between COVID-19 and MIS-C and provide insight into pathophysiology.METHODSWe prospectively enrolled hospitalized patients with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and classified them as having MIS-C or COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were classified as having either minimal or severe disease. Cytokine profiles, viral cycle thresholds (Cts), blood smears, and soluble C5b-9 values were analyzed with clinical data.RESULTSTwenty patients were enrolled (9 severe COVID-19, 5 minimal COVID-19, and 6 MIS-C). Five cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha) contributed to the analysis. TNF-alpha and IL-10 discriminated between patients with MIS-C and severe COVID-19. The presence of burr cells on blood smears, as well as Cts, differentiated between patients with severe COVID-19 and those with MIS-C.CONCLUSIONPediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk for critical illness with severe COVID-19 and MIS-C. Cytokine profiling and examination of peripheral blood smears may distinguish between patients with MIS-C and those with severe COVID-19.FUNDINGFinancial support for this project was provided by CHOP

METHODS: We used microarray to detect expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and mRNAs in peripheral lymphocytes from chronic benzene poisoning, acute myelocytic leukemia, and healthy controls. The lncRNAs and mRNAs were validated using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay was used to analyze chromosomal aberration. RESULTS: We found 173 upregulated and 258 downregulated lncRNAs, and 695 upregulated and 804 downregulated mRNAs. The lncRNA CUST_40243 and mRNA PDGFC and CDKN1A associated with chronic benzene poisoning. Relevant inflammatory response, hematopoietic cell lineage, and cell cycle may be important pathways for the sifted lncRNAs and mRNAs. Furthermore, micronuclei frequency was significantly higher in off-post chronic benzene poisoning patients. CONCLUSIONS: Chromosomal aberration induced by benzene exposure is irreversible. The lncRNA CUST_40243 and mRNA PDGFC and CDKN1A are related to chronic benzene poisoning.","['Tian, Wei', 'Wang, Tong-Shuai', 'Fang, Yan', 'Wu, Han-Tian', 'Zheng, Guo-Qiao', 'Guo, Kong-Rong', 'Huang, Ming', 'Sun, Dao-Yuan', 'Xia, Zhao-Lin']","['Tian W', 'Wang TS', 'Fang Y', 'Wu HT', 'Zheng GQ', 'Guo KR', 'Huang M', 'Sun DY', 'Xia ZL']","['Department of Occupation Health and Toxicology, School of Public Health, Fudan University (Mr Tian, Mr Wang, Mr Fang, Mr Wu, Mr Zheng, Dr Xia); Department of Occupational Disease, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital (Mr Guo, Dr Sun), Shanghai; Guangdong Province Hospital for Occupational Disease Prevention and Treatment, Guangzhou (Mr Huang), China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Occup Environ Med,Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,9504688,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/*poisoning', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",,,2020/07/31 06:00,2021/06/05 06:00,['2020/07/31 06:00'],"['2020/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/JOM.0000000000001875 [doi]', '00043764-202007000-00016 [pii]']",ppublish,J Occup Environ Med. 2020 Jul;62(7):e308-e317. doi: 10.1097/JOM.0000000000001875.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of this interest comes from data from relatively small, uncontrolled clinical trials. Objective: To determine the extent to which published data support the safety and effectiveness of microtransplantation of hematopoietic cells in persons with AML and MDS, examine what clinical data are needed to conclude that microtransplantation is safe and effective, explore microtransplantation's possible mechanisms of action, and determine whether this intervention is appropriately named. Evidence Review: PubMed was searched from 1966 to April 1, 2020, with the search terms micro-transplantation AND leukemia AND/OR myelodysplastic syndrome with boolean operators. The search identified 14 records; 11 additional records were identified by screening published reviews. A total of 15 records remained after removing duplicates and records without full text, and 14 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. Findings: Among the 14 studies including about 600 patients, data from 5 phase 2 studies and 6 case reports of persons with AML included few heterogeneous persons and had obvious selection biases. The single randomized clinical trial also enrolled few persons. There was only 1 phase 2 study of persons with MDS. Point estimates of outcomes in both settings had wide 95% CIs. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that, to date, there are no convincing data on the safety or effectiveness of microtransplantation in persons with AML or MDS. This strategy should be considered investigational and performed in the setting of controlled clinical trials.","['Pan, Bin', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Gale, Robert Peter']","['Pan B', 'Lazarus HM', 'Gale RP']","['Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Haematology Research Centre, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,,IM,"['Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy']",,,2020/07/31 06:00,2021/02/04 06:00,['2020/07/31 06:00'],"['2020/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['2768635 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.1706 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2020 Oct 1;6(10):1614-1620. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2020.1706.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reduced muscle mass may be related to reduced respiratory muscle strength; however, the impact of this on lung functional parameters is not characterized in adult allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHCT) recipients. METHODS: A consecutive retrospective series (n = 296) of patients who had alloHCT at a comprehensive cancer centre between March 2005 and April 2015 were included. Pre-transplant CT scans were used to quantify skeletal muscle and adipose tissue at the fourth thoracic (T4) and/or third lumbar (L3) level. Tumour and patient characteristics were recorded, including forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 ) by spirometry. Regression models were created to characterize predictive relationships. RESULTS: A total of 296 patients (male symboln = 161; female symboln = 135) were included, all of whom had chest CT as part of standard care; a subset of these (n = 215, 72.6%) also had abdominal CT. Diagnoses were non-Hodgkins lymphoma (n = 165), acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 66), Hodgkin's disease (n = 14), acute lymphocytic leukaemia (n = 14), myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 18), and other (n = 19). In multivariable linear regression adjusted for sex (P < 0.0001), age (P < 0.0001), haematopoietic cell transplantation-specific co-morbidity index (P = 0.010), and parameters of pulmonary function testing (defined by spirometry, P < 0.0001), both T4 muscle index [beta 0.127 (95% confidence interval 0.019; 0.252), P < 0.0001] and T4 muscle radiodensity [beta 0.132 (95% confidence interval 0.087; 0.505), P = 0.006] were independently associated with FEV1 ; disease risk index (P = 0.877) and Karnofsky performance status (P = 0.548) were not associated with FEV1 . Similar conclusions were obtained when L3 muscle index and radiodensity were considered. Unlike T4, L3 muscle index values can be compared with published cut-off values for sarcopenia. Overall rates of sarcopenia were uniformly higher in the HCT population than in age-matched and sex-matched patients with solid tumours [alloHCT male symbol64.7% vs. solid tumour male symbol56.6% (P < 0.001); alloHCT female symbol57.6% vs. solid tumour female symbol36.0% (P < 0.001)]. Significant but moderate correlations (P < 0.001) were found for muscle area and radiodensity between L3 and T4, for both men and women; adipose tissue quantity also correlated significantly (P < 0.001) between L3 and T4 for both men and women. CONCLUSIONS: Lumbar or thoracic CT images are useful for body composition assessment in this population and reveal high rates of sarcopenia, similar to those reported in very elderly patients. Reduced muscle mass and radiodensity associate with impaired FEV1 even after adjustment for clinical covariables including co-morbidities, performance status, disease risk, and mild intrinsic pulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) defined by spirometry.","['Mishra, Asmita', 'Bigam, Kevin D', 'Extermann, Martine', 'Faramand, Rawan', 'Thomas, Kerry', 'Pidala, Joseph A', 'Baracos, Vickie E']","['Mishra A', 'Bigam KD', 'Extermann M', 'Faramand R', 'Thomas K', 'Pidala JA', 'Baracos VE']","['Blood and Marrow Transplantation, H.

Results from an institution in Argentina.,e28624,10.1002/pbc.28624 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an infrequent disease characterized by clinical and biological features related to poor prognosis. Adapted therapies were designed without a clear consensus regarding the best treatment options. We aimed to compare the outcome between infant ALL cases receiving Interfant versus BFM-based protocols. PROCEDURE: This is a retrospective observational study. From April 1990 to June 2018, infant ALL cases were enrolled in one of the five consecutive treatment protocols. Clinical, demographic, and biological features and outcome were evaluated. A comparative analysis was performed between Interfant protocols and BFM-based protocols. RESULTS: During the studied period, 1913 ALL patients were admitted and 116 (6%) were infants. Treatment administered was: ALL-BFM'90 (n = 16), 1-ALL96-BFM/HPG (n = 7), Interfant-99 (n = 39), Interfant-06 (n = 35), and ALLIC-BFM'2009 (n = 19). The 5-year event-free survival probability (EFSp) was 31.9(standard error [SE] 4.6)% for the entire population, with a significant difference among risk groups according to Interfant-06 criteria (P = .0029). KMT2A-rearrangement status was the strongest prognostic factor (P = .048), independently of the protocol strategy. The median time for relapse was 24.1 months for patients with minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative versus 11.5 months for those with MRD-positive (P = .0386). EFSp and cumulative relapse risk probability (CRRp) were similar. Interfant protocols showed comparable induction (8.1% vs 7.1%, P = .852) and complete remission mortality (21.6% vs 28.6%, P = .438), failing to reduce the relapse rate (48.5% vs 30.7%, P = .149). CONCLUSIONS: Interfant protocols and BFM-based protocols presented comparable results. The risk group stratification proposed by Interfant-06 was validated by our results, and MRD seems useful to identify patients with an increased risk of early relapse.","['Pennella, Carla L', 'Deu, Maria A', 'Rossi, Jorge G', 'Baialardo, Edgardo M', 'Alonso, Cristina N', 'Rubio, Patricia', 'Guitter, Myriam R', 'La Rosa, Cristian G Sanchez', 'Alfaro, Elizabeth M', 'Zubizarreta, Pedro A', 'Felice, Maria S']","['Pennella CL', 'Deu MA', 'Rossi JG', 'Baialardo EM', 'Alonso CN', 'Rubio P', 'Guitter MR', 'La Rosa CGS', 'Alfaro EM', 'Zubizarreta PA', 'Felice MS']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hospital de Pediatria S.A.M.I.C Prof. Dr. Juan P.

Transforming retroviruses were isolated, and its oncogene was named ras after rat sarcoma. From 1979, cellular ras sequences with transforming properties were identified by transfection of tumor DNA initially by Robert Weinberg from rodent tumors, and the isolation of homologous oncogenes from human tumors soon followed, including HRAS and KRAS, and a new member of the family named NRAS.

PAX proteins are defined by the presence of a paired domain that is evolutionarily conserved across phylogenies. Inclusion of a homeodomain and/or an octapeptide linker subdivides PAX proteins into four groups. Often termed ""master regulators"", PAX proteins orchestrate tissue and organ development throughout cell differentiation and lineage determination, and are essential for tissue structure and function through maintenance of cell identity. Mutations in PAX genes are associated with myriad human diseases (e.g., microphthalmia, anophthalmia, coloboma, hypothyroidism, acute lymphoblastic leukemia). Transcriptional regulation by PAX proteins is, in part, modulated by expression of alternatively spliced transcripts. Herein, we provide a genomics update on the nine human PAX family members and PAX homologs in 16 additional species. We also present a comprehensive summary of human tissue-specific PAX transcript variant expression and describe potential functional significance of PAX isoforms. While the functional roles of PAX proteins in developmental diseases and cancer are well characterized, much remains to be understood regarding the functional roles of PAX isoforms in human health. We anticipate the analysis of tissue-specific PAX transcript variant expression presented herein can serve as a starting point for such research endeavors.","['Thompson, Brian', 'Davidson, Emily A', 'Liu, Wei', 'Nebert, Daniel W', 'Bruford, Elspeth A', 'Zhao, Hongyu', 'Dermitzakis, Emmanouil T', 'Thompson, David C', 'Vasiliou, Vasilis']","['Thompson B', 'Davidson EA', 'Liu W', 'Nebert DW', 'Bruford EA', 'Zhao H', 'Dermitzakis ET', 'Thompson DC', 'Vasiliou V']","['Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, 60 College Street, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA.', 'Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, 60 College Street, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA.', 'Program of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA.', ""Department of Environmental Health and Center for Environmental Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Research Center, University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45267, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics and Molecular and Developmental Biology, Cincinnati Children's Research Center, University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, 45267, USA."", 'HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee, European Bioinformatics Institute, Wellcome Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1SD, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, CB2 0AW, UK.', 'Program of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA.', 'Department of Genetic Medicine and Development, University of Geneva Medical School, 1211, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Institute for Genetics and Genomics in Geneva (iGE3), University of Geneva, 1211, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, CO, 80045, USA.', 'Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Yale School of Public Health, 60 College Street, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA. vasilis.vasiliou@yale.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Hum Genet,Human genetics,7613873,"['0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Evolution, Molecular', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2020/07/31 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/07/31 06:00'],"['2020/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2022/03/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00439-020-02212-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00439-020-02212-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Hum Genet. 2021 Mar;140(3):381-400. doi: 10.1007/s00439-020-02212-9.

However, a parallel comparison of their performances in r/r B-ALL therapy has not been sufficiently reported. Here, we manufactured 4-1BB- and CD28-based CD19 CAR-T cells using the same process technology and evaluated their efficacy and safety in r/r B-ALL therapy based on pre-clinical and exploratory clinical investigations. In B-ALL-bearing mice, a similar antitumor effect and CAR-T kinetics in peripheral blood were observed at the CAR-T dose of 1 x 10(7)/mouse. However, when the dose was decreased to 1 x 10(6)/mouse, 4-1BB CAR-T cells were more potent in eradicating tumor cells and showed longer persistence than CD28 CAR-T cells. Retrospective analysis of an exploratory clinical study that used 4-1BB- or CD28-based CAR-T cells to treat r/r B-ALL was performed. Compared with CD28 CAR-T cells, 4-1BB CAR-T cells resulted in higher antitumor efficacy and less severe adverse events. This study demonstrated that the performance of 4-1BB CAR-T cells was superior to that of CD28 CAR-T cells in suppressing CD19(+) B-ALL, at least under our manufacturing process.","['Zhao, Xiangyu', 'Yang, Junfang', 'Zhang, Xian', 'Lu, Xin-An', 'Xiong, Min', 'Zhang, Jianping', 'Zhou, Xiaosu', 'Qi, Feifei', 'He, Ting', 'Ding, Yanping', 'Hu, Xuelian', 'De Smet, Floris', 'Lu, Peihua', 'Huang, Xiaojun']","['Zhao X', 'Yang J', 'Zhang X', 'Lu XA', 'Xiong M', 'Zhang J', 'Zhou X', 'Qi F', 'He T', 'Ding Y', 'Hu X', 'De Smet F', 'Lu P', 'Huang X']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, No. 11 South Street of Xizhimen, Xicheng District, Beijing 100044, China."", 'Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, Hebei 065201, China.', 'Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100176, China.', 'Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, Hebei 065201, China.', 'Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100176, China.', 'Immunochina Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Beijing 100089, China.', 'Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, Hebei 065201, China.', 'Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100176, China.', 'Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, Hebei 065201, China.', 'Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100176, China.', 'Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, Hebei 065201, China.', 'Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100176, China.', 'Immunochina Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Beijing 100089, China.', 'Immunochina Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Beijing 100089, China.', 'Immunochina Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Beijing 100089, China.', 'Immunochina Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Beijing 100089, China.', 'Sartorius Stedim North America, Inc., 565 Johnson Avenue Bohemia, New York, NY 11716, USA.', 'Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, Hebei 065201, China.', 'Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100176, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, No. 11 South Street of Xizhimen, Xicheng District, Beijing 100044, China."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Beijing 100871, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Ther Oncolytics,Molecular therapy oncolytics,101666776,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-ALL therapy', 'CAR-T', 'co-stimulatory domain', 'dose']",2020/07/31 06:00,2020/07/31 06:01,['2020/07/31 06:00'],"['2020/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.omto.2020.06.016 [doi]', 'S2372-7705(20)30095-4 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Ther Oncolytics. 2020 Jun 24;18:272-281. doi: 10.1016/j.omto.2020.06.016. eCollection 2020 Sep 25.,,20200624,,['(c) 2020.'],,PMC7378699,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CITED2 is particularly efficient in the inhibition of HIF-1alpha-dependent transcription in different contexts, ranging from organ development and metabolic homeostasis to tissue regeneration and immunity, being also potentially involved in various other physiological processes. In addition, CITED2 plays an important role in inhibiting HIF in some diseases, including kidney and heart diseases and type 2-diabetes. In the particular case of cancer, CITED2 either functions by promoting or suppressing cancer development depending on the context and type of tumors. For instance, CITED2 overexpression promotes breast and prostate cancers, as well as acute myeloid leukemia, while its expression is downregulated to sustain colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, the role of CITED2 in the maintenance of cancer stem cells reveals its potential as a target in non-small cell lung carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia, for example. But besides the wide body of evidence linking both CITED2 and HIF signaling to carcinogenesis, little data is available regarding CITED2 role as a negative regulator of HIF-1alpha specifically in cancer. Therefore, comprehensive studies exploring further the interactions of these two important mediators in cancer-specific models are sorely needed and this can potentially lead to the development of novel targeted therapies.","['Fernandes, Monica T', 'Calado, Sofia M', 'Mendes-Silva, Leonardo', 'Braganca, Jose']","['Fernandes MT', 'Calado SM', 'Mendes-Silva L', 'Braganca J']","['School of Health, Universidade do Algarve, Campus of Gambelas, Faro 8005-139, Portugal.', 'Centre for Biomedical Research, Universidade do Algarve, Campus of Gambelas, Faro 8005-139, Portugal.', 'Centre for Biomedical Research, Universidade do Algarve, Campus of Gambelas, Faro 8005-139, Portugal.', 'Centre for Biomedical Research, Universidade do Algarve, Campus of Gambelas, Faro 8005-139, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,World J Clin Oncol,World journal of clinical oncology,101549149,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CBP/p300', 'CITED2', 'Cancer', 'Cancer stem cell', 'Hypoxia', 'Hypoxia-inducible factors 1alpha', 'Leukemia', 'Tumor']",2020/07/31 06:00,2020/07/31 06:01,['2020/07/31 06:00'],"['2020/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5306/wjco.v11.i5.260 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Clin Oncol. 2020 May 24;11(5):260-274. doi: 10.5306/wjco.v11.i5.260.,,,,"['(c)The Author(s) 2020.

However, the clinical relevance of serial molecular annotation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing active treatment is unknown. MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) patients who had at least two NGS assessments were identified. Outcomes according to mutation clearance (NGS-) on serial assessment were investigated. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to evaluate the prognostic impact of NGS trajectory on overall survival (OS). A total of 157 patients (MDS [n = 95]; sAML [n = 52]; CMML [n = 10]) were identified, with 93% of patients receiving treatment between NGS assessments. Magnitude of VAF delta from baseline was significantly associated with quality of response to treatment. Patients achieving NGS- had significantly improved OS compared to patients with mutation persistence (median OS not reached vs. 18.5 months; P = 0.002), which was confirmed in multivariate analysis (HR,0.14; 95%CI = 0.03-0.56; P = 0.0064).

Hence, in addition to somatic mutations and alternative RNA splicing, RNA editing can be a further source for recoding events. Although RNA editing has been detected in many solid cancers and normal tissue, RNA editing in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has not been addressed so far. We determined global RNA editing and recurrent, recoding RNA editing events from matched RNA-sequencing and whole exome sequencing data in CLL samples from 45 untreated patients. RNA editing was verified in a validation cohort of 98 CLL patients and revealed substantially altered RNA editing profiles in CLL compared with normal B cells. We further found that RNA editing patterns were prognostically relevant. Finally, we showed that ADAR knockout decreased steady state viability of MEC1 cells and made them more susceptible to treatment with fludarabine and ibrutinib in vitro. We propose that RNA editing contributes to the pathophysiology of CLL and targeting the RNA editing machinery could be a future strategy to maximize treatment efficacy.","['Gassner, Franz J',

Mutations of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A are among the most frequent recurrent genetic lesions in AML. The majority of DNMT3A-mutant AML patients shows fast relapse and poor survival, but also patients with long survival or long-term remission have been reported. Underlying molecular signatures and mechanisms that contribute to these survival differences are only poorly understood and have not been studied in detail so far. We applied hierarchical clustering to somatic gene mutation profiles of 51 DNMT3A-mutant patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) AML cohort revealing two robust patient subgroups with profound differences in survival. We further determined molecular signatures that distinguish both subgroups. Our results suggest that FLT3 and/or NPM1 mutations contribute to survival differences of DNMT3A-mutant patients. We observed an upregulation of genes of the p53, VEGF and DNA replication pathway and a downregulation of genes of the PI3K-Akt pathway in short- compared to long-lived patients. We identified that the majority of measured miRNAs was downregulated in the short-lived group and we found differentially expressed microRNAs between both subgroups that have not been reported for AML so far (miR-153-2, miR-3065, miR-95, miR-6718) suggesting that miRNAs could be important for prognosis. In addition, we learned gene regulatory networks to predict potential major regulators and found several genes and miRNAs with known roles in AML pathogenesis, but also interesting novel candidates involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, cell cycle, cell differentiation, and immunity that may contribute to the observed survival differences of both subgroups and could therefore be important for prognosis. Moreover, the characteristic gene mutation and expression signatures that distinguished short- from long-lived patients were also predictive for independent DNMT3A-mutant AML patients from other cohorts and could also contribute to further improve the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) prognostic scoring system. Our study represents the first in-depth computational approach to identify molecular factors associated with survival differences of DNMT3A-mutant AML patients and could trigger additional studies to develop robust molecular markers for a better stratification of AML patients with DNMT3A mutations.","['Lauber, Chris', 'Correia, Nadia', 'Trumpp, Andreas', 'Rieger, Michael A', 'Dolnik, Anna', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Roeder, Ingo', 'Seifert, Michael']","['Lauber C', 'Correia N', 'Trumpp A', 'Rieger MA', 'Dolnik A', 'Bullinger L', 'Roeder I', 'Seifert M']","['Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry (IMB), Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cells and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Stem Cells and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University Medicine Berlin, Campus Virchow Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University Medicine Berlin, Campus Virchow Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry (IMB), Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry (IMB), Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany. michael.seifert@tu-dresden.de.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Dresden, Germany. michael.seifert@tu-dresden.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2020/07/31 06:00,2021/01/14 06:00,['2020/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-69691-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-69691-8 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jul 29;10(1):12761. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-69691-8.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2844-053X'],20200729,,,,PMC7391693,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our goal was to achieve a highly specific assay with a simple workflow, short turnaround time and low cost. METHOD: The assay uses a commercially available anchored multiplex PCR panel for target enrichment and library preparation, followed by sequencing using a MiSeq instrument. The panel includes all recurrent gene fusions in AML and ALL and is designed to detect gene-specific fusions without prior knowledge of the partner sequence or specific break points. Diagnostic RNA samples from 27 cases with hematological malignancies encompassing 23 different transcript variants were analyzed. In addition, 12 cases from a validation cohort were assessed. RESULT: All known fusion transcripts were identified with a high degree of confidence, with a large number of reads covering the breakpoints. Importantly, we could identify gene fusions where conventional methods had failed due to cryptic rearrangements or rare fusion partners. The newly-identified fusion partners were verified by RT-PCR and transcript-specific qPCR was designed for patient-specific follow-up. In addition, 12 cases were correctly assessed in a blind test, without prior knowledge of molecular cytogenetics or diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In summary, our results demonstrate that targeted RNA sequencing using anchored multiplex PCR can be implemented in a clinical laboratory for the detection of recurrent and rare gene fusions in hematological diagnostic samples.","['Engvall, Marie', 'Cahill, Nicola', 'Jonsson, Britt-Inger', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Hallbook, Helene', 'Cavelier, Lucia']","['Engvall M', 'Cahill N', 'Jonsson BI', 'Hoglund M', 'Hallbook H', 'Cavelier L']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics, and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.

Earlier we demonstrated that DEX decreased the activity of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) which is essential for the activation of cytarabine (ara-C). Therefore we investigated the effect of DEX on the in vivo sensitivity of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to ara-C and another deoxycytidine analog, gemcitabine, in the Brown Norway Myeloid Leukemia (BNML) rat model for AML, and its ara-C resistant variant B-araC, in relation to the effects on dCK activity.The antileukemic effect was evaluated as survival of the rats, while dCK activity was measured in leukemic spleen (completely consisting of BNML cells) with liver as representative normal tissue, 24 hr after treatment with ara-C or DEX with radioactive deoxycytidine (CdR) as a substrate.Treatment with ara-C increased life-span of BNML by 200%, which was not affected by DEX. Gemcitabine was ineffective. In the liver of BNML bearing rats DEX decreased dCK activity 33%, while ara-C increased dCK activity slightly (to 129%), but in the combination of ara-C/DEX dCK activity was also decreased. In the livers of Bara-C bearing rats dCK was 2.7-fold higher compared to BNML rats, which was increased 179% in the gemcitabine-DEX treated rats. In BNML leukemic spleens DEX decreased dCK activity 41% and gem/dex 46%, but ara-C increased dCK activity to 123%, but in the combination this effect was neutralized. In Bara-C spleens only ara-C/dex decreased dCK activity (32%).In conclusion; in an AML rat model DEX did not affect the antileukemic effect of ara-C, nor the dCK activity.","['Jaramillo, Adrian C', 'Bergman, Andries M', 'Comijn, Elizabeth M', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Peters, Godefridus J']","['Jaramillo AC', 'Bergman AM', 'Comijn EM', 'Jansen G', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Cloos J', 'Peters GJ']","['Laboratory of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, location VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Laboratory Medical Oncology, Amsterdam UMC, location VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Reumatology, Amsterdam UMC, location VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', ""Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam UMC, location VUMC, Pediatric Oncology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, location VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Laboratory Medical Oncology, Amsterdam UMC, location VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Rats']",['NOTNLM'],"['Brown Norway Myeloid Leukemia', 'Cytarabine', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'deoxycytidine kinase', 'gemcitabine']",2020/07/31 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2020/07/31 06:00'],"['2020/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15257770.2020.1780441 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2020;39(10-12):1346. doi: 10.1080/15257770.2020.1780441.

We investigated a variant of HL60 which is resistant to differentiation induction (HL60-R) by standard differentiation inducers such as retinoic acid and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). To find an explanation for this resistance, we examined nucleotide (NTP) and deoxynucleotide (dNTP) pools in HL60-R and its parent cell line, sensitive to differentiation, HL60-S. We also explored whether these differences led to a difference in sensitivity to various antimetabolites. Drug sensitivity was measured with the tetrazolium (MTT) assay, while nucleotides were measured with anion-exchange HPLC. HL60-R cells were between 2- and 5-fold resistant to the antimetabolites 5-fluorouracil, Brequinar, hydroxyurea and N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA), but more sensitive to aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC), cytarabine and thymidine (5- to 10-fold). The NTP pools in both HL60 variants showed a normal pattern with ATP being the highest (2530-2876 pmol/10(6) cells) and CTP being lowest. However, UTP pools were 2-fold higher in the HL60-S cells (p < .01), while CTP and GTP pools were 30% higher (p < .01) compared to HL60-R cells. For the dNTP pools, larger differences were observed, with dATP (50 pmol/10(6) cells) being highest in HL60-R cells, but dATP was 4-fold lower in HL60-S cells. In HL-60-R, the triple combination retinoic acid, DMSO and DAC increased all NTPs almost 2-fold in contrast to HL60-S. Uridine increased UTP (1.4-fold), CTP (2-fold) and dCTP (1.4.-fold) pools in both cell lines, but thymidine increased only dTTP pools (4- to 7-fold), with a depletion of dCTP. PALA decreased UTP and CTP in both cell lines, but increased ATP (only in HL60-R). Hydroxyurea decreased dNTP especially in HL60-S cells. In conclusion, the pronounced differences in NTP and dNTP pools between HL60-S and HL60-R possibly play a role in the induction of differentiation and drug sensitivity.","['Peters, Godefridus J', 'Leyva, Albert', 'Schwartsmann, Gilberto']","['Peters GJ', 'Leyva A', 'Schwartsmann G']","['Laboratory Medical Oncology, Amsterdam UMC, Location VUMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, Ceara, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', 'K8CXK5Q32L (pyrimidine)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Pyrimidines/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleotides/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['HL60 cells', 'deoxyribonucleotide pools', 'differentiation', 'pyrimidine antagonists', 'ribonucleotide pools']",2020/07/31 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2020/07/31 06:00'],"['2020/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15257770.2020.1782933 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2020;39(10-12):1369-1378. doi: 10.1080/15257770.2020.1782933.

In theory, from clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential to hematologic malignancies, there is a complex interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors, including miRNA. In practice, karyotype analysis assigns patients to different prognostic groups, and mutations are often associated with a particular disease phenotype. Among myeloproliferative disorders, secondary MDS is a group of special entities with a typical spectrum of genetic mutations and cytogenetic rearrangements resembling those in de novo MDS. This overview analyzes the present prognostic systems of MDS and the most recent efforts in the search for genetic and epigenetic markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of MDS.","['Veryaskina, Yuliya Andreevna', 'Titov, Sergei Evgenievich', 'Kovynev, Igor Borisovich', 'Pospelova, Tatiana Ivanovna', 'Zhimulev, Igor Fyodorovich']","['Veryaskina YA', 'Titov SE', 'Kovynev IB', 'Pospelova TI', 'Zhimulev IF']","['Laboratory of Gene Engineering, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, SB RAS, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Department of the Structure and Function of Chromosomes, Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, SB RAS, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Vector-Best, 630117 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Department of Therapy, Hematology and Transfusiology, Novosibirsk State Medical University, 630091 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Department of Therapy, Hematology and Transfusiology, Novosibirsk State Medical University, 630091 Novosibirsk, Russia.', 'Department of the Structure and Function of Chromosomes, Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, SB RAS, 630090 Novosibirsk, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Medicina (Kaunas),"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",9425208,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)', '147153-65-9 (SRSF2 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/analysis', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/analysis', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Dioxygenases', 'Humans', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics/physiopathology', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis', '*Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'RNA Splicing Factors/analysis', 'Repressor Proteins/analysis', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['IPSS-R', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'karyotype', 'microRNA', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",2020/07/31 06:00,2021/03/19 06:00,['2020/07/31 06:00'],"['2020/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/19 06:00 [medline]']","['medicina56080376 [pii]', '10.3390/medicina56080376 [doi]']",epublish,Medicina (Kaunas). 2020 Jul 27;56(8). pii: medicina56080376. doi: 10.3390/medicina56080376.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3799-9407', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9401-5737']",20200727,,,['19-34-60024/Russian Foundation for Basic Research'],PMC7466347,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, histone deacetylation represses transcription of genes responsible for cell differentiation/death. A previous clinical study suggested potential pharmacodynamic antagonism between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and DNA hypomethylating agents (HMA). Herein, to determine such antagonism, we used MDS/AML lines and NHD13 transgenic mice, and demonstrated that treatment with the pan-HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) significantly decreased TET2 expression and global 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels. Mechanistically, our RNAi screen revealed that HDAC4 was responsible for maintaining TET2 levels. Accordingly, HDAC4 knockout reduced expression levels of MTSS1, a known TET2 target, an event associated with decreased 5hmC enrichment on the MTSS1 enhancer. Retrospective analysis of GEO datasets demonstrated that lower HDAC4 levels predict worse prognosis for AML patients. In an MDS-L xenografted immunodeficient mouse model, vitamin C co-treatment prevented TET2 loss of activity seen following SAHA treatment. Accordingly, vitamin C co-treatment further reduced MDS-L cell engraftment relative to SAHA alone. In summary, our findings suggest that co-administration of a TET2 agonist with pan-HDACi treatment could effectively counter potential diminution in TET2 activity resulting from pan-HDACi treatment alone, providing a rationale for evaluating such combinations against high-risk MDS/AML.","['Huang, Feiteng', 'Sun, Jie', 'Chen, Wei', 'He, Xin', 'Zhu, Yinghui', 'Dong, Haojie', 'Wang, Hanying', 'Li, Zheng', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Khaled, Samer', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Huang, Jinwen', 'Li, Ling']","['Huang F', 'Sun J', 'Chen W', 'He X', 'Zhu Y', 'Dong H', 'Wang H', 'Li Z', 'Zhang L', 'Khaled S', 'Marcucci G', 'Huang J', 'Li L']","['Department of Hematology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310016, China.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'The Integrative Genomics Core, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310016, China.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT), Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT), Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310016, China.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,,IM,,['NOTNLM'],"['TET2', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'histone deacetylase', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']",2020/07/30 06:00,2020/07/30 06:00,['2020/07/30 06:00'],"['2020/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['103605 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.103605 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Aging (Albany NY). 2020 Jul 29;12(17):16759-16774. doi: 10.18632/aging.103605.,,20200729,,,"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA248149/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL141336/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7521497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, there is a constant need to develop alternative therapeutic drugs. Bioactive compounds derived from natural products including animals, plants and microorganisms are being actively studied as sources for anticancer treatments. Freshwater planarians are important models for stem cell research and regeneration. However, to date, no studies on the biological activities of planaria extracts on cancer have been published. The aim of this study was to examine the potential antitumoral activity of the extract from planaria species-Malta (PSM) on human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) HL-60 cells. Antiproliferative activity was studied in terms of proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. The expression of genes involved in the regulation of these important cellular processes was also analyzed using real-time PCR. PSM extract exhibited a selective cytotoxic effect on HL-60 cells when compared to normal lymphocytes. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis and Annexin V/PI assay showed that the extract induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. The PSM extract induced myeloid differentiation with HL-60 cells showing a decreased nucleo/cytoplasmic ratio, an increase in nitroblue tetrazolium-positive cells, and CD11b- and CD14-positive cells. Finally, we also found that the PSM extract increased the expression of CEBPA, CEBPB, CEBPE, SPI1, BAX, CDKN1A and CDKN2C; whereas it reduced the expression of c-MYC and BCL2. This is the first study to reveal the antiproliferative, cytotoxic, and differentiation potential of PSM on HL-60 cells and suggests that it may have considerable potential for development as a novel natural product-based anticancer agent against AML.","['Suleiman, Sherif', 'Di Fiore, Riccardo', 'Cassar, Analisse', 'Formosa, Melissa Marie', 'Calleja-Agius, Jean', 'Schembri-Wismayer, Pierre']","['Suleiman S', 'Di Fiore R', 'Cassar A', 'Formosa MM', 'Calleja-Agius J', 'Schembri-Wismayer P']","['Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, University of Malta, Msida, MSD 2080, Malta.

In total, 288 patients aged 40 to 60 years, with de novo acute myeloid leukemia, receiving UCBT with at least 2 HLA mismatches with RIC (n = 166) or MAC (n = 122) regimens were included. As compared to RIC, the MAC cohort included relatively younger patients, having received more single UCBT, with lower total nucleated cell counts and more in vivo T cell depletion. Median time to neutrophil engraftment, infections (bacterial, viral, and fungal), and grade II to IV acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease were similar in both groups. In the multivariate analysis, overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; P = .9), NRM (HR, 0.68; P = .2), and relapse (HR, 1.24; P = .5) were not different between RIC and MAC.

To assess progress, this study examined recent mortality and survival data for individuals younger than 20 years. METHODS: Age-adjusted death rates were calculated with the National Vital Statistics System for 2002-2016. Annual percent changes (APCs) and average annual percent changes (AAPCs) were calculated with joinpoint regression. Five-year relative survival was calculated on the basis of National Program of Cancer Registries data for 2001-2015. Death rates and survival were estimated overall and by sex, 5-year age group, race/ethnicity, cancer type, and county-based economic markers. RESULTS: Death rates decreased during 2002-2016 (AAPC, -1.5), with steeper declines during 2002-2009 (APC, -2.6), and then plateaued (APC, -0.4). Leukemia and brain cancer were the most common causes of death from pediatric cancer, and brain cancer surpassed leukemia in 2011. Death rates decreased for leukemia and lymphoma but were unchanged for brain, bone, and soft-tissue cancers. From 2001-2007 to 2008-2015, survival improved from 82.0% to 85.1%. Survival was highest in both periods among females, those aged 15 to 19 years, non-Hispanic Whites, and those in counties in the top 25% by economic status. Survival improved for leukemias, lymphomas, and brain cancers but plateaued for bone and soft-tissue cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Although overall death rates have decreased and survival has increased, differences persist by sex, age, race/ethnicity, cancer type, and economic status. Improvements in pediatric cancer outcomes may depend on improving therapies, access to care, and supportive and long-term care.","['Siegel, David A', 'Richardson, Lisa C', 'Henley, S Jane', 'Wilson, Reda J', 'Dowling, Nicole F', 'Weir, Hannah K', 'Tai, Eric W', 'Buchanan Lunsford, Natasha']","['Siegel DA', 'Richardson LC', 'Henley SJ', 'Wilson RJ', 'Dowling NF', 'Weir HK', 'Tai EW', 'Buchanan Lunsford N']","['Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*epidemiology', '*mortality', '*pediatric', '*survival']",2020/07/30 06:00,2021/06/12 06:00,['2020/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33080 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Oct 1;126(19):4379-4389. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33080.

In Japan, Southern blotting has long been routinely performed for detection of clonally expanded ATL cells in vivo, and as a confirmatory diagnostic test for ATL. However, alternative methods to Southern blotting, such as sensitive, quantitative, and rapid analytical methods, are currently required in clinical practice. In this study, we developed a high-throughput method called rapid amplification of integration site (RAIS) that could amplify HTLV-1-integrated fragments within 4 h and detect the integration sites in > 0.16% of infected cells. Furthermore, we established a novel quantification method for HTLV-1 clonality using Sanger sequencing with RAIS products, and the validity of the quantification method was confirmed by comparing it with next-generation sequencing in terms of the clonality. Thus, we believe that RAIS has a high potential for use as an alternative routine molecular confirmatory test for the clonality analysis of HTLV-1-infected cells.","['Saito, Masumichi', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Yamauchi, Shunsuke', 'Nakagawa, So', 'Sasaki, Daisuke', 'Nao, Naganori', 'Tanio, Michikazu', 'Wada, Yusaku', 'Matsudaira, Takahiro', 'Momose, Haruka', 'Kuramitsu, Madoka', 'Yamagishi, Makoto', 'Nakashima, Makoto', 'Nakahata, Shingo', 'Iha, Hidekatsu', 'Ogata, Masao', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Uchimaru, Kaoru', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori']","['Saito M', 'Hasegawa H', 'Yamauchi S', 'Nakagawa S', 'Sasaki D', 'Nao N', 'Tanio M', 'Wada Y', 'Matsudaira T', 'Momose H', 'Kuramitsu M', 'Yamagishi M', 'Nakashima M', 'Nakahata S', 'Iha H', 'Ogata M', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Uchimaru K', 'Morishita K', 'Watanabe T', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Yanagihara K']","['Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan. saitomas@nih.go.jp.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan. hhase@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan. hhase@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Biomedical Informatics Laboratory, Department of Molecular Life Science, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Micro/Nano Technology Center, Tokai University, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Virology III, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Biotechnological Research Support Division, FASMAC Co., Ltd, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Biotechnological Research Support Division, FASMAC Co., Ltd, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Safety Research on Blood and Biological Products, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oita University, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'The Institute of Medical Science Research Hospital and Future Center Initiative, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusha Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['*Clone Cells', 'HTLV-I Infections/*diagnosis', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/*virology', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/*methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HTLV-1', 'RAIS (rapid amplification of integration site)']",2020/07/30 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/07/30 06:00'],"['2020/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-02935-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-02935-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 Sep;112(3):300-306. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-02935-5.

These changes have several implications for the care of older adults (>/= 60 years), who have inferior clinical outcomes. We review decision-making in older adults, focusing on patient- and disease-related factors. We then summarize current treatment options, including multiple recently approved therapies, based on hypothetical clinical scenarios. RECENT FINDINGS: In lieu of using chronological age to determine fitness, we highlight the importance of standardized fitness assessments using geriatric assessments. Next, we review intensive and lower-intensity treatment options in the upfront setting. We focus on multiple newly approved medications, including venetoclax, midostaurin, CPX-351, gemtuzumab, glasdegib, enasidenib, and ivosidenib, and their specific indications. Lastly, we briefly discuss supportive care of older adults with AML. Outcomes of older adults with AML remain poor; fortunately, there are many new promising treatment options. Personalized treatment plans based on patient- and disease-specific factors are essential to the care of older adults with AML.","['Abdallah, Maya', 'Xie, Zhuoer', 'Ready, Audrey', 'Manogna, Dharmini', 'Mendler, Jason H', 'Loh, Kah Poh']","['Abdallah M', 'Xie Z', 'Ready A', 'Manogna D', 'Mendler JH', 'Loh KP']","['Sections of Hematology/Oncology & Geriatrics, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Depatment of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts - Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Rochester General Hospital, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Rochester Medical Center, James P.

Metabolism may be a molecular target in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where mutations in metabolic genes have been described. This study evaluated glycolysis and OXPHOS as therapeutic targets. The sensitivity to 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG; glycolysis inhibitor) and oligomycin (OXPHOS inhibitor) was tested in six AML cell lines (HEL, HL-60, K-562, KG-1, NB-4, THP-1). These cells were characterized for IDH1/2 exon 4 mutations, reactive oxygen species, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Metabolic activity was assessed by resazurin assay, whereas cell death and cell cycle were assessed by flow cytometry. Glucose uptake and metabolism-related gene expression were analyzed by (18)F-FDG and RT-PCR/qPCR, respectively. No IDH1/2 exon 4 mutations were detected. HEL cells had the highest (18)F-FDG uptake and peroxides/superoxide anion levels, whereas THP-1 showed the lowest. 2-DG reduced metabolic activity in all cell lines with HEL, KG-1, and NB-4 being the most sensitive cells. Oligomycin decreased metabolic activity in a cell line-dependent manner, the THP-1 resistant and HL-60 being the most sensitive. Both inhibitors induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in a cell line- and compound-dependent manner. 2-DG decreased (18)F-FDG uptake in HEL, HL-60, KG-1, and NB-4, while oligomycin increased the uptake in K-562. Metabolism gene expression had different responses to treatments. In conclusion, HEL and KG-1 show to be more glycolytic, whereas HL-60 was more OXPHOS dependent. Results suggest that AML cells reprogram their metabolism to overcome OXPHOS inhibition suggesting that glycolysis may be a better therapeutic target.","['Lapa, Beatriz', 'Goncalves, Ana Cristina', 'Jorge, Joana', 'Alves, Raquel', 'Pires, Ana Salome', 'Abrantes, Ana Margarida', 'Coucelo, Margarida', 'Abrunhosa, Antero', 'Botelho, Maria Filomena', 'Nascimento-Costa, Jose Manuel', 'Sarmento-Ribeiro, Ana Bela']","['Lapa B', 'Goncalves AC', 'Jorge J', 'Alves R', 'Pires AS', 'Abrantes AM', 'Coucelo M', 'Abrunhosa A', 'Botelho MF', 'Nascimento-Costa JM', 'Sarmento-Ribeiro AB']","['Faculty of Medicine (FMUC), Laboratory of Oncobiology and Hematology (LOH) and University Clinic of Hematology, University of Coimbra, Azinhaga de Santa Comba-Celas, 3000-548, Coimbra, Portugal.', 'Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research (iCBR) -

Identifying potential miRNA-disease associations contributes to understanding the molecular mechanisms of miRNA-related diseases. Most of the existing computational methods mainly focus on predicting whether a miRNA-disease association exists or not. However, the roles of miRNAs in diseases are prominently diverged, for instance, Genetic variants of miRNA (mir-15) may affect the expression level of miRNAs leading to B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, while circulating miRNAs (including mir-1246, mir-1307-3p, etc.) have potentials to detecting breast cancer in the early stage. In this paper, we aim to predict multi-type miRNA-disease associations instead of taking them as binary. To this end, we innovatively represent miRNA-disease-type triples as a tensor and introduce tensor decomposition methods to solve the prediction task. Experimental results on two widely-adopted miRNA-disease datasets: HMDD v2.0 and HMDD v3.2 show that tensor decomposition methods improve a recent baseline in a large scale (up to $38\%$ in Top-1F1). We then propose a novel method, Tensor Decomposition with Relational Constraints (TDRC), which incorporates biological features as relational constraints to further the existing tensor decomposition methods. Compared with two existing tensor decomposition methods, TDRC can produce better performance while being more efficient.","['Huang, Feng', 'Yue, Xiang', 'Xiong, Zhankun', 'Yu, Zhouxin', 'Liu, Shichao', 'Zhang, Wen']","['Huang F', 'Yue X', 'Xiong Z', 'Yu Z', 'Liu S', 'Zhang W']","['College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University.', 'Department of Computer Science & Engineering, The Ohio State University.', 'College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University.', 'College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University.', 'College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University.', 'Wuhan University.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Brief Bioinform,Briefings in bioinformatics,100912837,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', '*Computational Biology', '*Databases, Nucleic Acid', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', '*MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', '*RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*alternating direction method of multipliers', '*disease', '*microRNA', '*prediction for multiple types of associations', '*relational constraints', '*tensor decomposition']",2020/07/30 06:00,2021/11/23 06:00,['2020/07/30 06:00'],"['2020/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['5876601 [pii]', '10.1093/bib/bbaa140 [doi]']",ppublish,Brief Bioinform. 2021 May 20;22(3). pii: 5876601. doi: 10.1093/bib/bbaa140.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7217-4462', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5221-2628']",,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Methylation in promoters of tumor suppressor genes is one of the mechanisms that causes blood malignancy. In this study, we evaluated the promoter DNA methylation status of miR-129-2 tumor suppressor gene and its association with clinical and laboratory parameters of patients with CLL. Methods: We studied the promoter DNA methylation frequency of the miR-129-2 gene in 50 patients with CLL and 50 healthy controls using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction methods. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS-18 software, and a p-value < 0.050 was considered statistically significant. Results: The frequency of promoter DNA methylation of the miR-129-2 gene was significantly higher in the CLL group compared with control group (38.0% vs. 0.0%, p < 0.001; chi(2) = 23.457). The promoter DNA methylation frequency of miR-129-2 gene was not significantly different between the two sexes (p = 0.236). A significant but weak correlation was seen between the methylated state of the miR-129-2 gene and organomegaly (p = 0.019, r = 0.330) as well as hemoglobin levels (p = 0.020, r = -0.233). However, binary logistic regression analysis indicated organomegaly as the only clinical biomarker with a statistically significant association with the hypermethylated miR-129-2 gene state (p = 0.046). Conclusions: The high frequency of promoter DNA methylation of the miR-129-2 gene in the CLL group compared to the control group, as well as its significant association with organomegaly, suggests the importance of this epigenetic biomarker in the pathogenesis and prognosis of CLL disease.","['Hashemi, Morteza', 'Mohammadipour, Mahshid', 'Rostami, Shahrbano', 'Soltanpour, Mohammad Soleiman']","['Hashemi M', 'Mohammadipour M', 'Rostami S', 'Soltanpour MS']","['Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, School of Paramedical Sciences, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Oman,Oman Med J,Oman medical journal,101526350,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell']",2020/07/30 06:00,2020/07/30 06:01,['2020/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5001/omj.2020.71 [doi]', 'OMJ-35-04-1900144 [pii]']",epublish,Oman Med J. 2020 Jul 27;35(4):e151. doi: 10.5001/omj.2020.71. eCollection 2020 Jul.,,20200727,,['The OMJ is Published Bimonthly and Copyrighted 2020 by the OMSB.'],,PMC7383833,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that resistance to regorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor for treating colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, can be caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor FBW7, which block degradation of the pro-survival Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1. We tested if Mcl-1 inhibition can be used to develop a precision combination therapy for overcoming regorafenib resistance. METHODS: Small-molecule Mcl-1 inhibitors were tested on CRC cells with knock-in (KI) of a non-degradable Mcl-1. Effects of Mcl-1 inhibitors on regorafenib sensitivity were determined in FBW7-mutant and -wild-type (WT) CRC cells and tumors, and in those with acquired regorafenib resistance due to enriched FBW7 mutations. Furthermore, translational potential was explored by establishing and analyzing FBW7-mutant and -WT patient-derived organoid (PDO) and xenograft (PDX) tumor models. RESULTS: We found that highly potent and specific Mcl-1 inhibitors such as S63845 overcame regorafenib resistance by restoring apoptosis in multiple regorafenib-resistant CRC models. Mcl-1 inhibition re-sensitized CRC tumors with intrinsic and acquired regorafenib resistance in vitro and in vivo, including those with FBW7 mutations. Importantly, Mcl-1 inhibition also sensitized FBW7-mutant PDO and PDX models to regorafenib. In contrast, Mcl-1 inhibition had no effect in FBW7-WT CRCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that Mcl-1 inhibitors can overcome intrinsic and acquired regorafenib resistance in CRCs by restoring apoptotic response. FBW7 mutations might be a potential biomarker predicting for response to the regorafenib/Mcl-1 inhibitor combination.","['Song, Xiangping', 'Shen, Lin', 'Tong, Jingshan', 'Kuang, Chaoyuan', 'Zeng, Shan', 'Schoen, Robert E', 'Yu, Jian', 'Pei, Haiping', 'Zhang, Lin']","['Song X', 'Shen L', 'Tong J', 'Kuang C', 'Zeng S', 'Schoen RE', 'Yu J', 'Pei H', 'Zhang L']","['UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, P.R.

The H2.0-like homeobox gene (HLX) encodes transcription factors that function in promoting normal hematopoietic cell proliferation and tumor immunity. The present study analyzed the effect of downregulating the HLX on cell cycle distribution and cell proliferation in AML. Moreover, the current study detected changes in the expression of genes and proteins in the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling pathway to investigate the mechanism of the action of HLX in tumor immunity in AML. HLX expression in AML cell lines was silenced using small interfering siRNA, and MTS/PMS-assay colorimetric assays were used to assess the effect of knockdown of HLX on AML cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to analyze changes in cell cycle distribution, while reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting were used to detect changes in the expression levels of key components of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, such as p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), neuropilin 1 (NRP1), B-cell translocation gene 1 (BTG1) and STAT5. It was found that HLX was differentially expressed in AML cell lines of various subtypes, and HLX expression was higher in the AML/M3 subtype NB4 cell line compared with the control group. Knockdown of HLX in NB4 cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation and arrested cells in the G0/G1 phase. Moreover, STAT5 protein expression, as well as NRP1 and PAK1 expression levels were downregulated, while BTG1 expression was upregulated when HLX was knocked out by siRNA. Collectively, the results suggested that downregulation of HLX may cause G0/G1 phase arrest and inhibit the proliferation of AML cells by activating the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.","['Zhu, Xia-Yin', 'Guo, Qun-Yi', 'Zhu, Min', 'Chen, Bao-Guo', 'Wang, Ling-Yan', 'Zhang, Dan-Qiong', 'Zhang, Li', 'Shao, Yan-Ping', 'Luo, Wen-Da']","['Zhu XY', 'Guo QY', 'Zhu M', 'Chen BG', 'Wang LY', 'Zhang DQ', 'Zhang L', 'Shao YP', 'Luo WD']","['Department of Hematology, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang, Wenzhou Medical College, Taizhou, Zhejiang 317000, P.R.

Several novel genetic alterations, which target critical cellular pathways, including alterations in lymphoid development-regulating genes, tumor suppressors and oncogenes that contribute to leukemogenesis, have been identified. The present study aimed to identify molecular markers associated with the occurrence and poor prognosis of AML. Information on these molecular markers may facilitate prediction of clinical outcomes. Clinical data and RNA expression profiles of AML specimens from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were assessed. Mutation data were analyzed and mapped using the maftools package in R software. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Reactome and Gene Ontology analyses were performed using the clusterProfiler package in R software. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed using the survminer package in R software. The expression data of RNAs were subjected to univariate Cox regression analysis, which demonstrated that the mutation loads varied considerably among patients with AML. Subsequently, the expression data of mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs/miR) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were subjected to univariate Cox regression analysis to determine the the 100 genes most associated with the survival of patients with AML, which revealed 48 mRNAs and 52 miRNAs. The top 1,900 mRNAs (P<0.05) were selected through enrichment analysis to determine their functional role in AML prognosis. The results demonstrated that these molecules were involved in the transforming growth factor-beta, SMAD and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 fusion mutant signaling pathways.

Modifications of m6A are dynamic and reversible, may regulate gene expression levels and serve vital roles in numerous life processes, such as cell cycle regulation, cell fate decision and cell differentiation. In recent years, m6A modifications have been reported to exhibit functions in human cancers via regulation of RNA stability, microRNA processing, mRNA splicing and mRNA translation, including lung cancer, breast tumor and acute myeloid leukemia. In the present review, the roles of m6A modifications in the onset and progression of cancer were summarized. These modifications display an oncogenic role in certain types of cancer, whereas in other types of cancer they exhibit a tumor suppressor role. Therefore, understanding the biological functions performed by m6A in different types of tumors and identifying pivotal m6A target genes to deduce the potential mechanisms underlying the progression of cancer may assist in the development of novel therapeutics.","['Yang, Jun', 'Chen, Junwen', 'Fei, Xiang', 'Wang, Xia', 'Wang, Kefeng']","['Yang J', 'Chen J', 'Fei X', 'Wang X', 'Wang K']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110000, P.R.

In 2015, >8.7 million people died worldwide due to cancer, and by 2030 this figure is expected to increase to ~13.1 million. Tumor chemotherapy drugs have specific toxicity and side effects, and patients can also develop secondary drug resistance. To prevent and treat cancer, scientists have developed novel drugs with improved antitumor effects and decreased toxicity. Ailanthone (AIL) is a quassinoid extract from the traditional Chinese medicine plant Ailanthus altissima, which is known to have anti-inflammatory and antimalarial effects. An increasing number of studies have focused on AIL due to its antitumor activity. AIL can inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by up- or downregulating cancer-associated molecules, which ultimately leads to cancer cell death. Antitumor effects of AIL have been observed in melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, bladder, lung, breast, gastric and prostate cancer and vestibular neurilemmoma. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first review to describe the antitumor mechanisms of AIL.","['Ding, Haixiang', 'Yu, Xiuchong', 'Hang, Chen', 'Gao, Kaijun', 'Lao, Xifeng', 'Jia, Yangtao', 'Yan, Zhilong']","['Ding H', 'Yu X', 'Hang C', 'Gao K', 'Lao X', 'Jia Y', 'Yan Z']","['Medical School of Ningbo University, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang 315211, P.R.

Samples were collected for mutation analysis from patients who exhibited tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance following treatment or were in the accelerated or blast phase at diagnosis. The mutations in the breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-ABL proto-oncogene 1 (ABL1) kinase domain were evaluated using conventional sequencing or ultra-deep sequencing (UDS) of peripheral blood samples. Sanger sequencing and UDS of the cDNA region corresponding to the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain was performed. chi(2) test was used to assess the association of categorical variables between the mutated and non-mutated groups. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to generate the survival curves. Sequencing detected 28 different mutations in 54 of the 175 (30.86%) patients with CML. A total of 14 (8.0%) patients presented with the T315I mutation, accounting for the largest proportion in the mutated group. Eight patients (4.6%) presented with more than one mutation, three (37.5%) of whom harboured T315I coexisting with other mutations, and for nine (5.1%) patients, the results differed between conventional sequencing and UDS, with the mutations being missed by conventional sequencing. The results form this study suggested that programing mutation analysis in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia timely may guide the choice of TKIs.","['Liu, Jingjing', 'Yang, Haiping', 'Xu, Xiuwen', 'Yi, Shujuan', 'Meng, Li']","['Liu J', 'Yang H', 'Xu X', 'Yi S', 'Meng L']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430030, P.R.

In this regard, nurse-like cells (NLC), the monocyte-derived type 2 macrophages, deliver stimulatory signals via B-cell activating factor (BAFF), a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), and the C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12 (CXCL12). Previously, we demonstrated that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protects B-CLL cells from spontaneous apoptosis by activating the oncogenic complex NTSR2-TrkB (neurotensin receptor 2-tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B), only overexpressed in B-CLL cells, inducing anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) expression and Src kinase survival signaling pathways. Herein, we demonstrate that BDNF belongs to the NLC secretome and promotes B-CLL survival. This was demonstrated in primary B-CLL co-cultured with their autologous NLC, compared to B-CLL cells cultured alone. Inhibition of BDNF in co-cultures, enhances B-CLL apoptosis, whereas its exogenous recombinant activates pro-survival pathways in B-CLL cultured alone (i.e. Src activation and Bcl-2 expression), at a higher level than those obtained by the exogenous recombinant cytokines BAFF, APRIL and CXCL12, the known pro-survival cytokines secreted by NLC. Together, these results showed that BDNF release from NLC trigger B-CLL survival. Blocking BDNF would support research strategies against pro-survival cytokines to limit sustained B-CLL cell survival.","['Talbot, Hugo', 'Saada, Sofiane', 'Barthout, Elodie', 'Gallet, Paul-Francois', 'Gachard, Nathalie', 'Abraham, Julie', 'Jaccard, Arnaud', 'Troutaud, Danielle', 'Lalloue, Fabrice', 'Naves, Thomas', 'Fauchais, Anne-Laure', 'Jauberteau, Marie-Odile']","['Talbot H', 'Saada S', 'Barthout E', 'Gallet PF', 'Gachard N', 'Abraham J', 'Jaccard A', 'Troutaud D', 'Lalloue F', 'Naves T', 'Fauchais AL', 'Jauberteau MO']","['Equipe Accueil 3842 CAPTuR, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges University, 2, Rue du Docteur Marcland, 87025, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Equipe Accueil 3842 CAPTuR, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges University, 2, Rue du Docteur Marcland, 87025, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Equipe Accueil 3842 CAPTuR, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges University, 2, Rue du Docteur Marcland, 87025, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Equipe Accueil 3842 CAPTuR, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges University, 2, Rue du Docteur Marcland, 87025, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Hematology Laboratory, Dupuytren Hospital University Center of Limoges, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'CNRS-UMR 7276, Limoges University, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'CNRS-UMR 7276, Limoges University, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Dupuytren Hospital University Center of Limoges, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'CNRS-UMR 7276, Limoges University, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Dupuytren Hospital University Center of Limoges, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Equipe Accueil 3842 CAPTuR, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges University, 2, Rue du Docteur Marcland, 87025, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Equipe Accueil 3842 CAPTuR, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges University, 2, Rue du Docteur Marcland, 87025, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Equipe Accueil 3842 CAPTuR, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges University, 2, Rue du Docteur Marcland, 87025, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Equipe Accueil 3842 CAPTuR, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges University, 2, Rue du Docteur Marcland, 87025, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dupuytren Hospital University Center of Limoges, Limoges Cedex, France.', 'Equipe Accueil 3842 CAPTuR, Faculty of Medicine, Limoges University, 2, Rue du Docteur Marcland, 87025, Limoges Cedex, France. m-o.jauberteau-marchan@unilim.fr.', 'Department of Immunology, Dupuytren Hospital University Center of Limoges, Limoges Cedex, France. m-o.jauberteau-marchan@unilim.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NTSR2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Neurotensin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkB)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (tropomyosin-related kinase-B, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, trkB/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Neurotensin/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2020/07/30 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-69307-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-69307-1 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jul 28;10(1):12572. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-69307-1.,,20200728,,,,PMC7387561,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: To estimate the prevalence of and risk factors for sexual dysfunction among adult female survivors of childhood cancer and evaluate associations between dysfunction and psychological symptoms/quality of life (QOL). METHODS: Female survivors (N = 936, mean 7.8 +/- 5.6 years at diagnosis; 31 +/- 7.8 years at evaluation) and noncancer controls (N = 122) participating in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study completed clinical evaluations, Sexual Functioning Questionnaires (SFQ), and Medical Outcomes Survey Short Forms 36 (SF-36). Linear models compared SFQ scores between sexually active survivors (N = 712) and controls; survivors with scores <10th percentile of controls were classified with sexual dysfunction. Logistic regression evaluated associations between survivor characteristics and sexual dysfunction, and between sexual dysfunction and QOL. OUTCOMES: Sexual dysfunction was defined by scores <10th percentile of noncancer controls on the SFQ overall, as well as the domains of arousal, interest, orgasm, and physical problems, while QOL was measured by scores on the SF-36 with both physical and mental summary scales. RESULTS: Sexual dysfunction was prevalent among 19.9% (95% CI 17.1, 23.1) of survivors. Those diagnosed with germ cell tumors (OR = 8.82, 95% CI 3.17, 24.50), renal tumors (OR = 4.49, 95% CI 1.89, 10.67), or leukemia (OR = 3.09, 95% CI 1.50, 6.38) were at greater risk compared to controls. Age at follow-up (45-54 vs 18-24 years; OR = 5.72, 95% CI 1.87, 17.49), pelvic surgery (OR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.18, 3.50), and depression (OR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.10, 3.51) were associated with sexual dysfunction. Hypogonadism receiving hormone replacement (vs nonmenopausal/nonhypogonadal; OR = 3.31, 95% CI 1.53, 7.15) represented an additional risk factor in the physical problems (eg, vaginal pain and dryness) subscale. Survivors with sexual dysfunction, compared to those without sexual dysfunction, were more likely to score <40 on the physical (21.1% vs 12.7%, P = .01) and mental health (36.5% vs 18.2%, P < .01) summary scales of the SF-36. Only 2.9% of survivors with sexual dysfunction reported receiving intervention. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Health care providers should be aware of the increased risk of sexual dysfunction in this growing population, inquire about symptomology, and refer for appropriate intervention. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Strengths of this study include the use of a validated tool for evaluating sexual function in a large population of clinically assessed female childhood cancer survivors. Limitations include potential for selection bias, and lack of clinically confirmed dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Sexual dysfunction is prevalent among female childhood cancer survivors and few survivors receive intervention; further research is needed to determine if those with sexual dysfunction would benefit from targeted interventions.

RESULTS: Sixteen patients with the ETV6-ACSL6 fusion gene were identified, with a median age of 50 years. Twelve patients were male. Clinical diagnoses included chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified, acute myeloid leukemia, and other types of myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorders. Ten out of 12 patients had increased levels of eosinophils, and four out of five had increased levels of basophils in peripheral blood. Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors was ineffective. The prognosis of the patients was poor, with seven patients dying within 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the ETV6-ACSL6 fusion gene mainly present with myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic disorders, typically with increased eosinophils and/or basophils and poor survival. Intensive therapies such as allogenic stem cell transplantation should be an initial consideration for eligible patients.","['Wu, Xia', 'Cai, Hao', 'Qiu, Yu', 'Li, Jian', 'Zhou, Dao-Bin', 'Cao, Xin-Xin']","['Wu X', 'Cai H', 'Qiu Y', 'Li J', 'Zhou DB', 'Cao XX']","['Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.

The risk of developing a severe fatal disease in humans, the possibility of being infected with aerosols and the risk of being used as a biological weapon make the disease still an important health problem all over the world as there is no a specific treatment and vaccine that has proven effective againt the virus today. The pathogenesis of the disease is not known, but vascular endothelial damage is prominent. Therefore, it progresses with thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukopenia and this hematological findings can be confused with hematological malignancies. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignancy included in differential diagnoses and occurs as a result of mutations occuring at a stage of differentiation in the lymphoid precursor cells in the bone marrow. In this study, we present a case of ALL who was diagnosed with CCHF simultaneously. A 43-year old female patient who works in the library and does not have a chronic disease other than asthma and thyroid disorder, has admitted to our hospital with the complaints of intermittent fever, weakness, generalized joint and body pain for about 3 weeks. She had fever and the physical examination revealed bilateral cervical and right postauricular lymphadenopathies. Her aspartate aminotransferase: 77 U/L, alanine aminotransferase: 117 U/L, lactate dehydrogenase: 616 U/L, hemoglobin: 8.27 g/dl, leukocyte count: 15.690/mm3 , neutrophil count: 550/mm3 (%3.5), lymphocyte count: 6690/mm3 (%42.6), platelet count: 102.100/mm3 , C-reactive protein: 163.6 mg/L was detected and the patient was hospitalized on 5 August 2019 for further examination and treatment. Considering that the patient may have viral infection in the foreground the requested test results were detected as; anti-CMV IgM negative, anti-CMV IgG positive, anti-toxoplasma IgM negative, anti-toxoplasma IgG positive, anti-rubella IgM negative, anti-rubella IgG positive, HBsAg negative, anti-HBc IgM negative, antiHBs positive, anti-HAV IgM negative, anti-HAV IgG positive, anti-HCV negative, anti-HIV negative, EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) VCA IgM negative, EBV VCA IgG positive, EBV EBNA IgG positive. Brucella Rose Bengal and Coombs tube agglutination was found be negative. As the cytopenia of the patient deepened, the patient was accepted to have neutropenic fever and it was planned to start piperacillin-tazobactam 4 x 4.5 g/day and two units of erythrocyte replacement therapy. When the patient's history was questioned again, it was learned that she had a tick on her neck about three weeks ago and she had removed the tick herself; 4-5 days later she had the complaints of fever and flu like symptoms and also diarrhea complaints lasting for 3-4 days. Considering the current anamnesis and laboratory findings, the patient was thought to have CCHF and the patient was isolated. The serum sample taken from patient with an initial diagnosis of CCHF and sent to Department of Microbiology Reference Laboratory Public Health Agency of Turkey. The patient was referred to the Antalya Training and Research Hospital. The patient's CCHF serum result was positive. Ribavirin treatment was not initiated in the patient who was accepted to be in the convalescence period, piperacillin-tazobactam 4 x 4.5 g/day treatment was continued and supportive treatment was given. In the follow-up, as the patient's neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and lymphocytopenia still continuing, she was transferred to hematology clinic for malignancy examination and bone marrow biopsy performed by hematology and B cell ALL was diagnosed. She was accepted to be convalescent in terms of CCHF and chemotherapy was started for ALL treatment by hematology. The patient is still being followed up by the hematology clinic and allogenic hematopoietic stem cell tranplantation is planned for the patient. As a result, CCHF is a disease that can be confused with many differential diagnosis. With this case, it is aimed to draw attention to the diagnostic difficulties of CCHF and ALL and to be the first case in the literature.","['Cayiroz, Pinar', 'Cayiroz, Mehmet Umut', 'Iltar, Utku', 'Kurtoglu, Erdal']","['Cayiroz P', 'Cayiroz MU', 'Iltar U', 'Kurtoglu E']","['Burdur State Hospital, Clinic of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Burdur, Turkey.', 'Bucak State Hospital, Clinic of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Burdur, Turkey.', 'Antalya Training and Research Hospital, Clinic of Hematology, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Antalya Training and Research Hospital, Clinic of Hematology, Antalya, Turkey.']",['tur'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Turkey,Mikrobiyol Bul,Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,7503830,,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', '*Hemorrhagic Fever Virus, Crimean-Congo', 'Hemorrhagic Fever, Crimean/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Ticks/virology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Turkey']",,,2020/07/30 06:00,2020/08/05 06:00,['2020/07/30 06:00'],"['2020/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5578/mb.69381 [doi]'],ppublish,Mikrobiyol Bul. 2020 Apr;54(2):326-333. doi: 10.5578/mb.69381.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kirim-Kongo Kanamali Atesi ile Es Zamanli Akut Lenfoblastik Losemi Tanisi Alan Olgu.,,,,,

We discovered the proteins S100A8/S100A9 and EFEMP1 as the most differentially expressed factors. In an independent cohort of n = 58 APL patients EFEMP1 over-expression was associated with a worse overall survival. Furthermore, a subgroup analysis of ED caused by hemorrhagic complications revealed an association of metallothioneins (MT1G/MT1E) with higher bleeding rates, ED events and negative prognostic effects on overall survival. Finally, we identified a novel TPM4-KLF2 fusion transcripts in 44/64 APL samples. In summary, we report a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis and novel potential biomarkers of ED biology, which highlight novel pathways in ED events in APL.","['Jann, Johann-Christoph', 'Streuer, Alexander', 'Hecht, Anna', 'Nolte, Florian', 'Nowak, Verena', 'Danner, Justine', 'Oblander, Julia', 'Palme, Iris', 'Lengfelder, Eva', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Flach, Johanna', 'Nowak, Daniel']","['Jann JC', 'Streuer A', 'Hecht A', 'Nolte F', 'Nowak V', 'Danner J', 'Oblander J', 'Palme I', 'Lengfelder E', 'Platzbecker U', 'Hofmann WK', 'Flach J', 'Nowak D']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (EFEMP1 protein, human)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*early death', '*hematology']",2020/07/30 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/07/30 06:00'],"['2020/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1797006 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Dec;61(13):3066-3077. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1797006.

Similarities in T-LBL and T-ALL have raised the question whether these entities represent 1 disease or reflect 2 different diseases. The genetic profiles of T-ALL have been thoroughly investigated over the last 2 decades, whereas fairly little is known about genetic driver mutations in T-LBL. Nevertheless, the comparison of clinical, immunophenotypic, and molecular observations from independent T-LBL and T-ALL studies lent strength to the theory that T-LBL and T-ALL reflect different presentations of the same disease. Alternatively, T-LBL and T-ALL may simultaneously evolve from a common malignant precursor cell, each having their own specific pathogenic requirements or cellular dependencies that differ among stroma-embedded blasts in lymphoid tissues compared with solitary leukemia cells. This review aims to cluster recent findings with regard to clinical presentation, genetic predisposition, and the acquisition of additional mutations that may give rise to differences in gene expression signatures among T-LBL and T-ALL patients. Improved insight in T-LBL in relation to T-ALL may further help to apply confirmed T-ALL therapies to T-LBL patients.","['Kroeze, Emma', 'Loeffen, Jan L C', 'Poort, Vera M', 'Meijerink, Jules P P']","['Kroeze E', 'Loeffen JLC', 'Poort VM', 'Meijerink JPP']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Lymphoma, T-Cell', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes']",,,2020/07/30 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/07/30 06:00'],"['2020/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31571-8 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001822 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Jul 28;4(14):3466-3473. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001822.,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,PMC7391147,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard methods for clonal deconvolution seek to identify groups of mutations and estimate the prevalence of each group in the tumour, while considering its purity and copy number profile. These methods have been applied on cross-sectional data and on longitudinal data after discarding information on the timing of sample collection. Two key questions are how can we incorporate such information in our analyses and is there any benefit in doing so? RESULTS: We developed a clonal deconvolution method, which incorporates explicitly the temporal spacing of longitudinally sampled tumours. By merging a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model with Gaussian Process priors and using as input a sequence of several sparsely collected samples, our method can reconstruct the temporal profile of the abundance of any mutation cluster supported by the data as a continuous function of time. We benchmarked our method on whole genome, whole exome and targeted sequencing data from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, on liquid biopsy data from a patient with melanoma and on synthetic data and we found that incorporating information on the timing of tissue collection improves model performance, as long as data of sufficient volume and complexity are available for estimating free model parameters.

FLT3 inhibitors such as midostaurin, gilteritinib and quizartinib show excellent response rates in patients with FLT3-mutated AML, but its duration of response may not be sufficient yet. The majority of cases gain secondary resistance either by on-target and off-target abnormalities. On-target mutations (i.e., FLT3-TKD) such as D835Y keep the TK domain in its active form, abrogating pharmacodynamics of type II FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., midostaurin and quizartinib). Second generation type I inhibitors such as gilteritinib are consistently active against FLT3-TKD as well as FLT3-ITD. However, a ""gatekeeper"" mutation F691L shows universal resistance to all currently available FLT3 inhibitors. Off-target abnormalities are consisted with a variety of somatic mutations such as NRAS, AXL and PIM1 that bypass or reinforce FLT3 signaling. Off-target mutations can occur just in the primary FLT3-mutated clone or be gained by the evolution of other clones. A small number of cases show primary resistance by an FL-dependent, FGF2-dependent, and stromal CYP3A4-mediated manner. To overcome these mechanisms, the development of novel agents such as covalently-coupling FLT3 inhibitor FF-10101 and the investigation of combination therapy with different class agents are now ongoing. Along with novel agents, gene sequencing may improve clinical approaches by detecting additional targetable mutations and determining individual patterns of clonal evolution.","['Eguchi, Motoki', 'Minami, Yosuke', 'Kuzume, Ayumi', 'Chi, Sunggi']","['Eguchi M', 'Minami Y', 'Kuzume A', 'Chi S']","['Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa 277-8577, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa 277-8577, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa 277-8577, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kameda Medical Center, Kamogawa 296-8602, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa 277-8577, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'gilteritinib', 'quizartinib']",2020/07/30 06:00,2020/07/30 06:01,['2020/07/30 06:00'],"['2020/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/30 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines8080245 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines8080245 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2020 Jul 24;8(8). pii: biomedicines8080245. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines8080245.,,20200724,,,,PMC7459983,,,"['Y.M. received research funding from Ono and honoraria from Bristol-Myers Squibb,', 'Novartis, and Pfizer.

According to the solubility studies of DFX in different components, Peceol, Kolliphor EL, and Transcutol were selected as excipients. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed, and then SNEDDS formation assessment studies and solubility of DFX in selected SNEDDSs formulations were performed. DFX loaded SNEDDS were prepared and characterized. The optimum DFX-SNEDDS formulations were developed. The relative safety of the optimized SNEDDS formulation was examined in a human immortalized myelogenous leukemia cell line, K562 cells, using the MTT cell viability test. Cytotoxicity studies revealed more cell viability (71.44%) of DFX loaded SNEDDS compared to pure DFX (3.99%) at 40 muM. The selected DFX-SNEDDS formulation was converted into S-SNEDDS by adsorbing into porous carriers, in order to study its dissolution behavior. The in vitro drug release studies indicated that DFX release (Q5%) from S-SNEDDS solidified with Neusilin UFL2 was significantly higher (93.6 +/- 0.7% within 5 min) compared with the marketed product (81.65 +/- 2.10%). The overall results indicated that the S-SNEDDS formulation of DFX could have the potential to enhance the solubility of DFX, which would in turn have the potential to improve its oral bioavailability as a safe novel delivery system.","['Alghananim, Alaa', 'Ozalp, Yildiz', 'Mesut, Burcu', 'Serakinci, Nedime', 'Ozsoy, Yildiz', 'Gungor, Sevgi']","['Alghananim A', 'Ozalp Y', 'Mesut B', 'Serakinci N', 'Ozsoy Y', 'Gungor S']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Near East University, Nicosia 99010, Cyprus.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jerash University, Jerash 26150, Jordan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Near East University, Nicosia 99010, Cyprus.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Istanbul University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Istanbul 34116, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Near East University, Nicosia 99010, Cyprus.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Art and Sciences Near East University, Nicosia 99010, Cyprus.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Istanbul University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Istanbul 34116, Turkey.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Istanbul University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Istanbul 34116, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Pharmaceuticals (Basel),"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",101238453,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['SNEDDS', 'deferasirox', 'enhancement solubility', 'oral delivery', 'solid SNEDDS', 'solid carriers']",2020/07/30 06:00,2020/07/30 06:01,['2020/07/30 06:00'],"['2020/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/30 06:01 [medline]']","['ph13080162 [pii]', '10.3390/ph13080162 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmaceuticals (Basel). 2020 Jul 24;13(8). pii: ph13080162. doi: 10.3390/ph13080162.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7928-1666', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2838-1688', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1884-0839']",20200724,,,,PMC7465256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we retrospectively investigated the characteristics and real-world outcomes of R/R FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients in the Toulouse-Bordeaux DATAML registry. In the study, we included 316 patients with FLT3-ITD AML that received intensive chemotherapy as a first-line treatment. The rate of complete remission (CR) or CR without hematological recovery (CRi) was 75.2%, and 160 patients were R/R after a first-line TKI-free treatment (n = 294). Within the subgroup of R/R patients that fulfilled the main criteria of the QUANTUM-R study, 48.9% received an intensive salvage regimen; none received hypomethylating agents or low-dose cytarabine. Among the R/R FLT3-ITD AML patients with CR1 durations < 6 months who received intensive TKI-free treatment, the rate of CR or CRi after salvage chemotherapy was 52.8%, and these results allowed a bridge to be transplanted in 39.6% of cases. Finally, in this QUANTUM-R standard arm-matched cohort, the median overall survival (OS) was 7.0 months and 1-, 3- and 5-year OS were 30.2%, 23.7% and 21.4%, respectively. To conclude, these real-world data show that the intensity of the second-line treatment likely affects response and transplantation rates. Furthermore, the results indicate that including patients with low-intensity regimens, such as low-dose cytarabine or hypomethylating agents, in the control arm of a phase 3 trial may be counterproductive and could compromise the results of the study.","['Dumas, Pierre-Yves', 'Bertoli, Sarah', 'Berard, Emilie', 'Largeaud, Laetitia', 'Bidet, Audrey', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Leguay,

Typically, patients with AML-MRC experience low remission rates following intensive chemotherapy and a median overall survival of merely 9-12 months. In light of these discouraging outcomes, it has become evident that more effective therapies are needed for patients with AML-MRC. Liposomal daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) was approved in 2017 for adults with newly diagnosed AML-MRC and those with therapy-related AML (t-AML), and remains the only therapy specifically approved for this patient population. Other studies have also demonstrated the efficacy of the hypomethylating agent (HMA) azacitidine as upfront therapy for AML-MRC patients, which, to date, is the most common treatment employed for patients unable to tolerate the more intensive CPX-351. HMAs and venetoclax combinations have also been evaluated, but additional studies utilizing these agents in this specific subgroup are needed before conclusions regarding their role in the therapeutic armamentarium of AML-MRC patients can be reached.

Tools for cancer treatment have rapidly advanced in recent years, resulting in therapeutic strategies which are alternative and complementary to conventional treatment. To identify the cell surface receptors used by a tumor cell-adapted rotavirus and the cell death markers induced by its infection, we use Wt1-5, a rotavirus isolate recently adapted to tumor cells, to infect the human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Reh. The expression of cell surface receptors used by Wt1-5 was determined using flow cytometry and an antibody blocking assay to test for their implication in virus infection. Viral antigens and cell death markers induced by rotavirus infection were followed by flow cytometric analysis. The present study showed that rotavirus Wt1-5 was able to use cell surface proteins such as heat shock proteins (HSPs) 90, 70, 60 and 40, Hsc70, PDI and integrin beta3. Rotavirus Wt1-5 induced cytotoxic effects including changes in cell membrane permeability, alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential, DNA fragmentation and activation of cell death signaling. Wt1-5 deserves to be further studied as a candidate oncolytic agent due to its ability to induce apoptosis in lymphoblastic leukemia-derived cells.","['Guerrero, Rafael', 'Guerrero, Carlos', 'Acosta, Orlando']","['Guerrero R', 'Guerrero C', 'Acosta O']","['Department of Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Carrera 30 No. 45-03 Bloque 47, Ciudad Universitaria, Bogota 111321, Colombia.', 'Department of Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Carrera 30 No. 45-03 Bloque 47, Ciudad Universitaria, Bogota 111321, Colombia.', 'Department of Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Carrera 30 No. 45-03 Bloque 47, Ciudad Universitaria, Bogota 111321, Colombia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cancer treatment', 'heat shock proteins', 'oncolytic viruses', 'rotaviruses']",2020/07/30 06:00,2020/07/30 06:01,['2020/07/30 06:00'],"['2020/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/30 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines8080242 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines8080242 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2020 Jul 24;8(8). pii: biomedicines8080242. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines8080242.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8755-3385', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2863-6345']",20200724,,,,PMC7460319,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to characterize GH-induced changes in expression of signaling pathway elements and other proteins that may be related to atherosclerosis. METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and THP-1, a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, were stimulated by exposure to 10(-9) M or 10(-8) M human GH with or without pretreatment with a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1 inhibitor. Levels of transcripts encoding vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) -1, E-selectin, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1), interleukin (IL) -6, and IL-8 were investigated by reverse transcription (RT) -PCR. For the quantitative adhesion assay, THP-1 cells or human primary monocytes were fluorescently labeled with 3'-O-acetyl-2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl) -4 diacetoxymethyl ester (BCECF/AM). HUVEC treated with human GH were co-incubated with BCECF-labeled THP-1 cells. One hour later, the number of BCECF-labeled THP-1 cells was assessed. An equivalent experiment was performed using BCECF-labeled primary monocytes, and the number of monocytes adhering to HUVEC was counted. RESULTS: Treatment with hGH increased the levels of E-selectin- and VCAM-1-encoding mRNAs in HUVEC. This effect was attenuated by pretreatment with a MEK1 inhibitor. Furthermore, hGH treatment increased adhesion of BCECF-labeled THP-1 cells or primary monocytes to HUVEC, and this effect was attenuated by pretreatment with a MEK1 inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: VCAM-1 and E-selectin expression was stimulated by GH via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, resulting in augmented adhesion of THP-1 cells and monocytes to HUVEC. These data suggested that GH directly stimulates the development of atherosclerosis.","['Ishikawa, Mayumi', 'Toyomura, Junko', 'Yagi, Takashi', 'Kuboki, Koji', 'Morita, Toshisuke', 'Sugihara, Hitoshi', 'Hirose, Takahisa', 'Minami, Shiro', 'Yoshino, Gen']","['Ishikawa M', 'Toyomura J', 'Yagi T', 'Kuboki K', 'Morita T', 'Sugihara H', 'Hirose T', 'Minami S', 'Yoshino G']","['Center of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Arteriosclerosis, Nippon Medical School Musashikosugi Hospital, 1-396, Kosugi-cho, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki 211-8533, Japan.

We determined the CMV antigenemia level associated with increased CMV antigen-specific T cells (CASTs) at day +100 and decreased CMV reactivation after day +100. CMV reactivation and CASTs were measured with CMV antigenemia and CMV-specific major histocompatibility complex multimers. The analysis consisted of 775 CAST measurements obtained before and 30, 100, and 365 days post-alloHCT from 327 consecutive patients treated between 2008 and 2016. Detectable CASTs correlated with recipient (P < .0001) and donor (P < .0001) CMV seropositivity pre-alloHCT. CMV reactivation before day +100 was associated with a higher proportion of patients who achieved >/=3 CASTs/microL by day +100 (61% with versus 39% without reactivation, P < .001). In alloHCT recipients at high risk for CMV reactivation (R(+)D(+/-)) with a maximum of grade II acute graft-versus-host-disease, reactivating CMV before day +100 and achieving >/=3 versus <3 CASTs/microL at day +100 was associated with reduced CMV reactivation from day +100 to +365 (27% versus 62%, P = .04). This protective effect was observed with low-level but not high-level CMV reactivation (<5 versus >/=5/50,000 polymorphonuclear leukocytes + pp65, respectively). These findings suggest low-level CMV reactivation may be beneficial and that treatment may be delayed until progression. These findings will need validation in prospective clinical trials using CMV PCR and antigenemia assays.","['Chen, George L', 'Wallace, Paul K', 'Zhang, Yali', 'Tario, Joseph D Jr', 'Przespolewski, Amanda C', 'Becker, Joanne', 'Almyroudis, Nikolaos G', 'Ross, Maureen', 'Riches, Marcie', 'Segal, Brahm H', 'Brix, Liselotte', 'McCarthy, Philip L', 'Hahn, Theresa']","['Chen GL', 'Wallace PK', 'Zhang Y', 'Tario JD Jr', 'Przespolewski AC', 'Becker J', 'Almyroudis NG', 'Ross M', 'Riches M', 'Segal BH', 'Brix L', 'McCarthy PL', 'Hahn T']","['Department of Medicine, Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program, Roswell Park, Buffalo, New York.

This study aims to identify clinical and behavioral factors associated with poor life functioning in this population. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at an ambulatory clinic of a public hospital in Hong Kong. Licensed occupational therapists administered the Life Functioning Assessment Inventory on survivors diagnosed with cancer <19 years old and >/=5 years post-diagnosis. Survivors' career development self-efficacy, subjective happiness, and motivation were evaluated using structured questionnaires. Clinical information was obtained from medical records. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate factors associated with life functioning outcomes, adjusting for clinically relevant variables. Results: Eighty survivors were recruited (58.7% male; age at diagnosis: 6.7 [standard deviation (SD) = 4.8] years; age at evaluation: 24.4 [SD = 6.5] years). Compared to survivors of leukemia, survivors of brain tumor performed worse in social functioning (beta = -0.79, standard error [SE] = 0.36; p = 0.034). Survivors who had been treated with cranial radiation also had lower worker life functioning than those who had not (beta = -0.91, SE = 0.031; p = 0.021). Higher activity motivation was significantly associated with better leisure functioning (beta = 0.086, SE = 0.03; p = 0.008), social functioning (beta = 0.036, SE = 0.02; p = 0.036), and career development self-efficacy (beta = 1.04, SE = 0.26; p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Survivors of brain tumors and survivors who were treated with radiation have poorer life functioning, particularly in social and work domains. Future work includes validating the study findings in a larger cohort of survivors in Hong Kong. Addressing modifiable behavioral factors include motivating survivors to engage in meaningful activities that contribute to self-care and participation in society, as well as providing at-risk survivors with ongoing support from community vocational services.","['Yang, Hellen', 'Fong, Sanne', 'Chan, Phoebe', 'Cheung, Alice', 'Peng, Liwen', 'Yan, Jiaqi', 'Cheung, Yin Ting', 'Li, Chi-Kong']","['Yang H', 'Fong S', 'Chan P', 'Cheung A', 'Peng L', 'Yan J', 'Cheung YT', 'Li CK']","[""Occupation Therapy Department, Hong Kong Children's Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China."", ""Occupation Therapy Department, Hong Kong Children's Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China."", ""Occupation Therapy Department, Hong Kong Children's Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China."", 'Occupational Therapy Department, Princess of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, P.R.

Chromosomal translocations involving KMT2A often cause the formation of oncogenic fusion genes, such as the most common translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23) producing the KMT2A-AFF1 chimera. AIM: The aim of this study was to confirm and review the cytogenetic and molecular features of the KMT2A-rearranged RS4;11 cell line and put those in context with other reports of cell lines also harbouring a t(4;11) rearrangement. METHODS AND RESULTS: The main chromosomal rearrangements t(4;11)(q21;q23) and i(7q), described when the cell line was first established, were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and 24-colour karyotyping by M-FISH. Additional cytogenetic abnormalities were investigated by further FISH experiments, including the presence of trisomy 18 as a clonal abnormality and the discovery of one chromosome 8 being an i(8q), which indicates a duplication of the oncogene MYC. A homozygous deletion of 9p21 containing the tumour-suppressor genes CDKN2A and CDKN2B was also revealed by FISH. The production of the fusion transcript KMT2A-AFF1 arising from the der(11)t(4;11) was confirmed by RT-PCR, but sequencing of the amplified fragment revealed the presence of multiple isoforms. Two transcript variants, resulting from alternative splicing, were identified differing in one glutamine residue in the translated protein. CONCLUSION: As karyotype evolution is a common issue in cell lines, we highlight the need to monitor cell lines in order to re-confirm their characteristics over time. We also reviewed the literature to provide a comparison of key features of several cell lines harbouring a t(4;11). This would guide scientists in selecting the most suitable research model for this particular type of KMT2A-leukaemia.","['Ragusa, Denise', 'Makarov, Evgeny M', 'Britten, Oliver', 'Moralli, Daniela', 'Green, Catherine M', 'Tosi, Sabrina']","['Ragusa D', 'Makarov EM', 'Britten O', 'Moralli D', 'Green CM', 'Tosi S']","['Division of Biosciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Institute of Environment, Health and Societies, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, UK.', 'Division of Biosciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Institute of Environment, Health and Societies, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, UK.', 'Genome Engineering and Maintenance Network, Institute of Environment, Health and Societies, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, UK.', 'Division of Biosciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Institute of Environment, Health and Societies, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, UK.', 'Chromosome Dynamics, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Chromosome Dynamics, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Division of Biosciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Institute of Environment, Health and Societies, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, UK.', 'Genome Engineering and Maintenance Network, Institute of Environment, Health and Societies, Brunel University London, Uxbridge, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Rep (Hoboken),"Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",101747728,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '150826-18-9 (AFF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*KMT2A', '*MLL', '*RS4;11', '*clonal evolution', '*leukaemia', '*t(4;11)(q23;q21)']",2020/07/29 06:00,2021/10/05 06:00,['2020/07/29 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cnr2.1207 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Rep (Hoboken). 2019 Oct;2(5):e1207. doi: 10.1002/cnr2.1207.

It is effectively used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. However, development of resistance to imatinib mesylate as a result of BCR-ABL dependent and BCR-ABL independent mechanisms has emerged as a daunting problem in the management of CML patients. Between these mechanisms, BCR-ABL independent mechanisms are still not robustly understood. AIM: To investigate the correlation of HOXA4 and HOXA5 promoter DNA hypermethylation with imatinib resistance among CML patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples from 175 Philadelphia positive CML patients (83 good response and 92 BCR-ABL non-mutated imatinib resistant patients) were subjected to Methylation Specific High Resolution Melt Analysis for methylation levels quantification of the HOXA4 and HOXA5 promoter regions. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was done to elucidate the optimal methylation cut-off point followed by multiple logistic regression analysis. Log-Rank analysis was done to measure the overall survival difference between CML groups. The optimal methylation cut-off point was found to be at 62.5% for both HOXA4 and HOXA5. Chronic myeloid leukemia patients with >/=63% HOXA4 and HOXA5 methylation level were shown to have 3.78 and 3.95 times the odds, respectively, to acquire resistance to imatinib. However, overall survival of CML patients that have </=62% and >/= 63% methylation levels of HOXA4 and HOXA5 genes were found to be not significant (P-value = 0.126 for HOXA4; P-value = 0.217 for HOXA5). CONCLUSION: Hypermethylation of the HOXA4 and HOXA5 promoter is correlated with imatinib resistance and with further investigation, it could be a potential epigenetic biomarker in supplement to the BCR-ABL gene mutation in predicting imatinib treatment response among CML patients but could not be considered as a prognostic marker.","['Elias, Marjanu Hikmah', 'Azlan, Husin', 'Sulong, Sarina', 'Baba, Abdul Aziz', 'Ankathil, Ravindran']","['Elias MH', 'Azlan H', 'Sulong S', 'Baba AA', 'Ankathil R']","['Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia, Nilai, Malaysia.', 'Haemato-Oncology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Universiti Sains Malaysia Hospital, Kota Bharu, Malaysia.', 'Human Genome Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kelantan, Malaysia.', 'International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Human Genome Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kelantan, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Rep (Hoboken),"Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",101747728,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HOXA5 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', '127609-92-1 (HOXA4 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/blood/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Transcription Factors/blood/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*high-resolution melt analysis', '*hypermethylation', '*imatinib mesylate', '*resistance']",2018/08/01 00:00,2018/08/01 00:01,['2020/07/29 06:00'],"['2018/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/cnr2.1111 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Rep (Hoboken). 2018 Aug;1(2):e1111. doi: 10.1002/cnr2.1111.

AIMS: To benchmark regional outcomes for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) against published international standards. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective cohort study, analysing the clinical characteristics and health outcomes of all children diagnosed with and treated for ALL in Tasmania, Australia between 2006 and 2015. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients aged less than 18 years were diagnosed with ALL in the study's 10-year period. Twenty-eight cases were precursor B cell in origin, with 7 cases of T-cell ALL. The great majority of children (30/35; 86%) received their entire first line treatment in Tasmania. Major treatment-related toxicities, including allergic drug reactions, and episodes of acute pancreatitis, deep venous thrombosis and bacterial sepsis, were managed locally, with one death secondary to overwhelming infection and multiorgan failure. The overall and event-free survival rates for childhood ALL were 30/35 (86%) and 28/35 (80%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results compare favourably with published results from large international cooperative group trials based in developed countries. Continued local treatment with appropriate support from a dedicated specialist paediatric oncology unit is therefore justified.","['Heath, John A', 'Macdonald, Molly', 'Starosta, Helen', 'Hitchins, Samuel', 'Wills, Karen', 'Daubenton, John D']","['Heath JA', 'Macdonald M', 'Starosta H', 'Hitchins S', 'Wills K', 'Daubenton JD']","['Department of Paediatrics, Royal Hobart Hospital, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Royal Hobart Hospital, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Royal Hobart Hospital, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Hobart Hospital, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Menzies Institute of Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Royal Hobart Hospital, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Rep (Hoboken),"Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",101747728,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Pancreatitis/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Tasmania/epidemiology', 'Venous Thrombosis/chemically induced/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*childhood', '*health outcomes']",2018/08/01 00:00,2018/08/01 00:01,['2020/07/29 06:00'],"['2018/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/cnr2.1107 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Rep (Hoboken). 2018 Aug;1(2):e1107. doi: 10.1002/cnr2.1107.

Leukemias are diverse in type, affected population, prognosis, and treatment regimen, yet a common theme in leukemia is the dysregulated metabolism of leukemic cells and leukemic stem cells with respect to their noncancerous counterparts. RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we highlight current findings that elucidate metabolic traits unique to the four major types of leukemia, which confer carcinogenic survival but can be potentially exploited for therapeutic intervention. These metabolic features can work in conjunction with or be independent of unique aspects of the bone marrow microenvironment that can also influence cell survival and proliferation, thus sustaining carcinogenesis. CONCLUSION: Deepening our understanding of the interactions of leukemias with their niche environments in vivo will inform future treatments for leukemia, particularly for those that are refractive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and other therapeutic mainstays.","['Nemkov, Travis', ""D'Alessandro, Angelo"", 'Reisz, Julie A']","['Nemkov T', ""D'Alessandro A"", 'Reisz JA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Rep (Hoboken),"Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",101747728,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology/*therapy', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Stem Cell Niche', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*leukemia', '*mass spectrometry', '*metabolism', '*metabolomics', '*stable isotope tracing', '*tumor microenvironment']",2019/04/01 00:00,2021/10/05 06:00,['2020/07/29 06:00'],"['2018/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cnr2.1139 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Rep (Hoboken). 2019 Apr;2(2):e1139. doi: 10.1002/cnr2.1139.

METHODS: Bone marrow samples of 122 de novo patients with acute myeloid leukemia (prior to treatment) and 30 healthy donors (after enrollment) were collected, and long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 expression was detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. According to median value of long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 expression in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, they were divided into long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 high expression and low expression patients (which were further categorized as low---, low--, and low- expression patients). RESULTS: Long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 expression was decreased in patients with acute myeloid leukemia compared to healthy donors. Besides, receiver operating characteristic curve displayed that long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 distinguished patients with acute myeloid leukemia from healthy donors. In patients with acute myeloid leukemia, long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 low expression was associated with poor-risk stratification but was not correlated with age, gender, French-American-Britain classification, or white blood cell level. For prognosis, complete remission rate was lowest in long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 low--- expression patients, followed by long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 low-- expression patients, long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 low- expression patients, and was highest in long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 high expression patients; Kaplan-Meier curves displayed that lower long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 expression was associated with reduced event-free survival and overall survival; Cox regression analysis showed that lower long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 expression independently predicted decreased event-free survival and worse overall survival in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSION: Long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 may function as a novel marker for effective surveillance and management of acute myeloid leukemia.","['He, Chunling', 'Wang, Xinmei', 'Luo, Jing', 'Ma, Yinghua', 'Yang, Zhen']","['He C', 'Wang X', 'Luo J', 'Ma Y', 'Yang Z']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang, China.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MEG3 non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'ROC Curve']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*complete remission', '*event-free survival', '*long noncoding RNA maternally expressed gene 3', '*overall survival']",2020/07/29 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2020/07/29 06:00'],"['2020/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1533033820945815 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2020 Jan-Dec;19:1533033820945815. doi: 10.1177/1533033820945815.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0034-1748'],,,,,PMC7388093,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Adult patients with a preimplant history of malignancy who underwent LVAD implantation between 2006 and 2018 were included. The primary outcome was post-LVAD survival. RESULTS: A total of 250 patients underwent LVAD implant during the study period, including 37 (14.8%) patients with a history of malignancy. Of these 37 patients, five (13.5%) had active malignancy at the time of LVAD implantation, and seven had more than one type of cancer. The median disease-free duration before LVAD was 3.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] 1.0-7.75 years). The most common types of malignancy included urologic (n = 20; 45.5%), skin (n = 7, 15.9%), and leukemia or lymphoma (n = 6; 13.6%). Median follow-up was 244 (IQR, 126-571) days and 313 (IQR 127-738) days for those with and without a history of malignancy, respectively (P = .49). Unadjusted post-LVAD survival was reduced in those with a malignancy history (2-year survival 53.4% vs 66.9%; P = .01), a finding that persisted after risk-adjustment (hazard ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.14; P = .01). Only one (2.7%) patient died post-LVAD from their cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Although a history of malignancy is associated with reduced survival after LVAD implantation, more than half of the patients are alive at 2 years. This combined with the fact that most do not die from causes directly related to their cancer suggest that LVAD implantation is reasonable to perform in carefully selected patients with a history of malignancy.","['Hong, Yeahwa', 'Seese, Laura', 'Hickey, Gavin', 'Chen, Shangzhen', 'Mathier, Michael A', 'Kilic, Arman']","['Hong Y', 'Seese L', 'Hickey G', 'Chen S', 'Mathier MA', 'Kilic A']","['Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Cardiac Surgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Heart and Vascular Institute, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Cardiology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Heart and Vascular Institute, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Heart and Vascular Institute, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Cardiology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Cardiac Surgery, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Heart and Vascular Institute, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Card Surg,Journal of cardiac surgery,8908809,,IM,"['Adult', '*Heart Failure', '*Heart-Assist Devices', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Thoracic Surgical Procedures', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['left ventricular assist device', 'malignancy', 'outcomes']",2020/07/29 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/07/29 06:00'],"['2020/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jocs.14723 [doi]'],ppublish,J Card Surg. 2020 Sep;35(9):2224-2231. doi: 10.1111/jocs.14723.

The prognostic significance of the IGH translocation is controversial and its mutational profile remains unknown. Here, we present for the first time a comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of 46 CLL patients with IGH rearrangement (IGHR-CLLs) and we demonstrate that IGHR-CLLs have a distinct mutational profile with recurrent mutations in NOTCH1, IGLL5, POT1, BCL2, FBXW7, ZMYM3, MGA, BRAF and HIST1H1E genes. Interestingly, BCL2 and FBXW7 mutations were significantly associated with this subgroup and almost half of BCL2, IGLL5 and HISTH1E mutations reported were previously identified in non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Notably, IGH/BCL2 rearrangements were associated with a lower mutation frequency and carried BCL2 and IGLL5 mutations, while the other IGHR-CLLs had mutations in genes related to poor prognosis (NOTCH1, SF3B1 and TP53) and shorter time to first treatment (TFT). Moreover, IGHR-CLLs patients showed a shorter TFT than CLL patients carrying 13q-, normal fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and +12 CLL, being this prognosis particularly poor when NOTCH1, SF3B1, TP53, BIRC3 and BRAF were also mutated. The presence of these mutations not only was an independent risk factor within IGHR-CLLs, but also refined the prognosis of low-risk cytogenetic patients (13q-/normal FISH). Hence, our study demonstrates that IGHR-CLLs have a distinct mutational profile from the majority of CLLs and highlights the relevance of incorporating NGS and the status of IGH by FISH analysis to refine the risk-stratification CLL model.","['Perez-Carretero, Claudia', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Maria', 'Gonzalez, Teresa', 'Quijada-Alamo, Miguel', 'Martin-Izquierdo, Marta', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Jesus-Maria', 'Vidal, Maria-Jesus', 'de Coca, Alfonso Garcia', 'Aguilar, Carlos', 'Vargas-Pabon, Manuel', 'Alonso, Sara', 'Sierra, Magdalena', 'Rubio-Martinez, Araceli', 'Davila, Julio', 'Diaz-Valdes, Jose R', 'Queizan, Jose-Antonio', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jose-Angel', 'Benito, Rocio', 'Rodriguez-Vicente, Ana E', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus-Maria']","['Perez-Carretero C', 'Hernandez-Sanchez M', 'Gonzalez T', 'Quijada-Alamo M', 'Martin-Izquierdo M', 'Hernandez-Sanchez JM', 'Vidal MJ', 'de Coca AG', 'Aguilar C', 'Vargas-Pabon M', 'Alonso S', 'Sierra M', 'Rubio-Martinez A', 'Davila J', 'Diaz-Valdes JR', 'Queizan JA', 'Hernandez-Rivas JA', 'Benito R', 'Rodriguez-Vicente AE', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM']","['Universidad de Salamanca, IBSAL, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBMCC-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Universidad de Salamanca, IBSAL, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBMCC-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Universidad de Salamanca, IBSAL, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBMCC-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Universidad de Salamanca, IBSAL, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBMCC-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Universidad de Salamanca, IBSAL, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBMCC-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Universidad de Salamanca, IBSAL, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBMCC-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario, Leon, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico, Valladolid, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Complejo Hospitalario de Soria, Soria, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Jarrio, Asturias, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Virgen de la Concha, Zamora, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Nuestra Senora de Sonsoles, Avila, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Segovia, Segovia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Segovia, Segovia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain.', 'Universidad de Salamanca, IBSAL, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBMCC-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Universidad de Salamanca, IBSAL, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBMCC-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Universidad de Salamanca, IBSAL, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, IBMCC-CSIC, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Translocation, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*chromosomal translocations', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*clinical molecular genetics', '*cytogenetics', '*high-throughput sequencing', '*prognostic biomarkers']",2020/07/29 06:00,2021/04/17 06:00,['2020/07/29 06:00'],"['2020/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.33235 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2020 Nov 15;147(10):2780-2792. doi: 10.1002/ijc.33235.

Cases of MLLT10r AML or T-ALL bearing immature phenotype are at high risk of poor outcome, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and sensitivity to targeted therapies remain poorly characterized. This review addresses the incidence and prognostic significance of MLLT10r in acute leukemia, and how the aberrant gene expression profile of this disease can inform potential targeted therapeutic strategies. Understanding the underlying genomics of MLLT10r acute leukemia, both clinically and molecularly, will improve prognostic stratification and accelerate the development of targeted therapeutic strategies, to improve patient outcomes.","['Forgione, Michelle O', 'McClure, Barbara J', 'Yeung, David T', 'Eadie, Laura N', 'White, Deborah L']","['Forgione MO', 'McClure BJ', 'Yeung DT', 'Eadie LN', 'White DL']","['Cancer Program, Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Faculty of Science, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Cancer Program, Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Cancer Program, Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Cancer Program, Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Cancer Program, Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Faculty of Science, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health and Medical Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', ""Australian Genomics Health Alliance (AGHA), The Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia."", ""Australian and New Zealand Children's Oncology Group (ANZCHOG), Hudson Institute, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,,['NOTNLM'],"['AF10', 'MLLT10', 'MLLT10 rearrangements', 'leukemia genomics', 't(10;11)(p12-13;q14-21)']",2020/07/29 06:00,2020/07/29 06:00,['2020/07/29 06:00'],"['2020/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22887 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2020 Jul 28. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22887.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7020-7440', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5201-4127', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7558-9927', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1912-7602', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4844-333X']",20200728,,['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.'],"['Beat Cancer Project/Cancer Council South Australia', 'Peter Nelson Research Fellow/Cancer Council South Australia', 'Leukaemia Foundation', 'National Health and Medical Research Council', 'University of Adelaide: PhD Scholarship']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This fact, however, may lead to neurocognitive impairments in survivors, as shown in some studies. The prefrontal cortex and executive functions seem to be particularly vulnerable due to the late maturation in the development process. Executive impairments have been associated with poorer quality of life in childhood cancer survivors. A systematic review was carried out with studies that assessed executive functions in childhood ALL survivors.\ Studies were collected from five electronic databases: MEDLINE (PubMed); PsycInfo; WebOfScience; LILACS and IBECS. Eighty-four studies were retrieved from the database search, of which 50 were read in full and 26 met the inclusion criteria. The studies were heterogeneous as to the instruments used to assess executive function, the skills assessed and the comparison methods. Despite some discrepancies, ALL survivors seem to exhibit poorer executive functioning than typical controls, but this result did not hold true when subjects were compared to normative mean. Changes in brain structure and dynamics resulting from the disease itself, the toxicity of the treatment and difficulties in coping with the stress during treatment may be related to executive impairments in ALL survivors. Discussion proposed standardized methods and measures for assessing executive functioning in children during and after ALL treatment.","['Godoy, Priscilla Brandi Gomes', 'Simionato, Natalia Maria', 'de Mello, Claudia Berlim', 'Suchecki, Deborah']","['Godoy PBG', 'Simionato NM', 'de Mello CB', 'Suchecki D']","['Departamento de Psicobiologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Rua Napoleao de Barros, 925 - Vila Clementino, Sao Paulo, SP, 04023062, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Psicobiologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Rua Napoleao de Barros, 925 - Vila Clementino, Sao Paulo, SP, 04023062, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Psicobiologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Rua Napoleao de Barros, 925 - Vila Clementino, Sao Paulo, SP, 04023062, Brazil. cberlimmello@gmail.com.', 'Departamento de Psicobiologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Rua Napoleao de Barros, 925 - Vila Clementino, Sao Paulo, SP, 04023062, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",United States,Neuropsychol Rev,Neuropsychology review,9009029,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Executive Function/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', 'Quality of Life', 'Survivors/psychology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Leukemia', '*Lymphoid; executive function; cortex', '*Prefrontal']",2020/07/29 06:00,2021/07/23 06:00,['2020/07/29 06:00'],"['2019/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11065-020-09446-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11065-020-09446-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Neuropsychol Rev. 2020 Sep;30(3):386-406. doi: 10.1007/s11065-020-09446-4.

Serious bacterial infections (SBI) were defined as culture-positive blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, articular fluid or stool infections, pneumonia, brucellosis, and rickettsiosis. Overall, 664 children < 18 years of age were enrolled; 407 (62.2%) had fever > 38.0 degrees C and 247 (37.8%) were non-febrile at admission. There were 425 (64.0%), 125 (18.8%), 48 (7.2%), and 66 (9.9%) patients aged 0-24 months, 2-6, 7-12, and > 12 years, respectively. No differences were recorded in the distribution of febrile vs. non-febrile patients among the age groups nor among the 3 neutropenia severity groups (< 0.5, 0.5-1.0 and 1.0-1.5 x 10(9)/L). SBI infections were diagnosed in 98 (14.8%) patients, with higher rates among febrile patients vs. non-febrile patients (16.8% vs. 11.5%, P = 0.06). Brucellosis and rickettsiosis were diagnosed in 15.4% and 23.1% tests performed, respectively. 295/688 (42.9%) virologic examinations returned positive. Among patients < 24 months, more febrile ones had viral infectious compared with afebrile patients (P = 0.025). Acute leukemia was diagnosed in 6 patients. Neutropenia resolved in 163/323 (50.5%) patients during a 1-month follow-up. No differences were recorded in neutropenia resolution between febrile and non-febrile children among all 3 severity groups. Severe neutropenia was rare and occurred mainly in very young patients. SBIs were more common among febrile patients compared with non-febrile patients, but there was no association between severity of neutropenia or its resolution and the presence or absence of fever at diagnosis.","['Leibovitz, Eugene', 'Kapelushnik, Joseph', 'Alsanaa, Sabrin', 'Tschernin, Dov', 'Sergienko, Ruslan', 'Leibovitz, Ron', 'Mazar, Julia', 'Fruchtman, Yariv']","['Leibovitz E', 'Kapelushnik J', 'Alsanaa S', 'Tschernin D', 'Sergienko R', 'Leibovitz R', 'Mazar J', 'Fruchtman Y']","['Division of Pediatrics, Soroka University Medical Center, Beer Sheva, Israel. eugenel@bgu.ac.il.', 'Soroka University Medical Center, Beer Sheva, Israel. eugenel@bgu.ac.il.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel. eugenel@bgu.ac.il.', 'Pediatric Infectious Disease Unit, Soroka University Medical Center, P.O.

Here we have employed Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) to analyze a dense time course of transcriptional regulation in THP-1 cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) over 96 h. PMA treatment greatly reduced the numbers of cells entering S phase and also blocked cells exiting G2/M. The PMA-treated cells became adherent and expression of mature macrophage-specific genes increased progressively over the duration of the time course. Within 1-2 h PMA induced known targets of tumor protein p53 (TP53), notably CDKN1A, followed by gradual down-regulation of cell-cycle associated genes. Also within the first 2 h, PMA induced immediate early genes including transcription factor genes encoding proteins implicated in macrophage differentiation (EGR2, JUN, MAFB) and down-regulated genes for transcription factors involved in immature myeloid cell proliferation (MYB, IRF8, GFI1). The dense time course revealed that the response to PMA was not linear and progressive. Rather, network-based clustering of the time course data highlighted a sequential cascade of transient up- and down-regulated expression of genes encoding feedback regulators, as well as transcription factors associated with macrophage differentiation and their inferred target genes. CAGE also identified known and candidate novel enhancers expressed in THP-1 cells and many novel inducible genes that currently lack functional annotation and/or had no previously known function in macrophages. The time course is available on the ZENBU platform allowing comparison to FANTOM4 and FANTOM5 data.","['Gazova, Iveta', 'Lefevre, Lucas', 'Bush, Stephen J', 'Clohisey, Sara', 'Arner, Erik', 'de Hoon, Michiel', 'Severin, Jessica', 'van Duin, Lucas', 'Andersson, Robin', 'Lengeling, Andreas', 'Hume, David A', 'Summers, Kim M']","['Gazova I', 'Lefevre L', 'Bush SJ', 'Clohisey S', 'Arner E', 'de Hoon M', 'Severin J', 'van Duin L', 'Andersson R', 'Lengeling A', 'Hume DA', 'Summers KM']","['The Roslin Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.', 'The Roslin Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.', 'The Roslin Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.', 'The Roslin Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.', 'RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Yokohama, Japan.', 'RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Yokohama, Japan.', 'RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Bioinformatics Centre, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Bioinformatics Centre, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Max Planck Society - Administrative Headquarters, Munich, Germany.', 'Mater Research Institute - University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'The Roslin Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.', 'Mater Research Institute - University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['THP-1 cells', 'cell cycle', 'differentiation', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'p53', 'transcriptome']",2020/07/29 06:00,2020/07/29 06:01,['2020/07/29 06:00'],"['2019/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2020.00498 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2020 Jul 3;8:498. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2020.00498. eCollection 2020.,,20200703,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Gazova, Lefevre, Bush, Clohisey, Arner, de Hoon, Severin, van', 'Duin, Andersson, Lengeling, Hume and Summers.']",,PMC7347797,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are limited data available on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with hematological malignancies with more than 60 days of follow-up. This study describes the clinical characteristics, including multiple recurrences of COVID-19, in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) during 69 days of follow-up. Case Presentation: A 72-year-old female was admitted to hospital isolation after being infected with COVID-19 as part of a family cluster on January 30, 2020. Apart from SARS-Cov-2 virus infection, laboratory results revealed lymphocytosis of uncertain etiology and abnormal distribution of T lymphocytes. On blood smears, small blue lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm were observed, and the presence of high levels of circulating clonal B cells was also demonstrated by flow cytometry. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and CLL. Among her family members, she had the highest viral loads and the fastest progression on lung injury and developed severe pneumonia. Serological results showed she had both 2019-nCoV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies; however, only IgG antibodies were detected in her husband's plasma. Results: A combination regimen of antiviral therapy and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the early stage seemed to be effective for treating CLL and SARS-Cov-2 infection. Because of the low humoral immune response, the CLL patient could not effectively clear the SARS-Cov-2 infection and suffered from recurrence twice during the 69-day follow-up. Conclusion: In CLL, a neoplastic antigen-specific B-cell clone proliferates, and the progeny cells accumulate and outgrow other B cells, leading to immune deficiency. Considering the low humoral immune response and ineffective clearance of SARS-Cov-2 in CLL patients, the follow-up and home quarantine period should be extended. We need further studies to clarify suspending or continuing CLL therapy during COVID infection. For those patients who are prone to progression to severe disease, administering humoral immunity therapies can help to prevent disease progression and quickly meet the cure criteria.","['Ye, Xingnong', 'Xiao, Xiaofang', 'Li, Bin', 'Zhu, Weigang', 'Li, Youjiang', 'Wu, Jianguo', 'Huang, Xin', 'Jin, Jingxia', 'Chen, Dan', 'Jin, Jie', 'Huang, Jian']","['Ye X', 'Xiao X', 'Li B', 'Zhu W', 'Li Y', 'Wu J', 'Huang X', 'Jin J', 'Chen D', 'Jin J', 'Huang J']","['Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematologic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'coronavirus disease-2019', 'follow-up', 'humoral immunity', 'ineffective clearance']",2020/07/29 06:00,2020/07/29 06:01,['2020/07/29 06:00'],"['2020/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.01272 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jul 3;10:1272. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01272. eCollection 2020.,,20200703,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Ye, Xiao, Li, Zhu, Li, Wu, Huang, Jin, Chen, Jin and Huang.']",,PMC7348056,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG), as a type of non-LCH, is usually a benign disease limited to the skin. Systemic involvement is rarely reported. The present case report describes a 15-year-old boy diagnosed with disseminated JXG involving skin and bone marrow concurrent with severe symptoms of HLH during ALL therapy. Examination of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes in B-cell precursor leukemic blasts and histiocytes in the skin and bone marrow revealed identical rearrangements, confirming clonal relationship between both diseases. Implementation of corticosteroids, vinblastine, etoposide, cyclosporine, and tocilizumab resulted in partial skin lesion resolution with no improvement of bone marrow function; therefore, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was eventually performed. The patient's hematological and general status has improved gradually; however, remarkable recovery of skin lesions was observed after empirical antitubercular therapy.

However, three of the five BCR-ABL TKIs, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib, increase the risk of developing arterial thrombosis. Prior investigations reported that nilotinib and ponatinib affect the endothelium, but the mechanisms by which they exert their toxic effects are still unclear. The impact of dasatinib and bosutinib on endothelial cells has been poorly investigated. Here, we aimed to provide an in vitro homogenous evaluation of the effects of BCR-ABL TKIs on the endothelium, with a special focus on the type of cell death to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the potential cytotoxic effects of BCR-ABL TKIs nilotinib and ponatinib on endothelial cells. We tested the five BCR-ABL TKIs at three concentrations on human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs). This study highlights the endothelial toxicity of ponatinib and provides insights about the mechanisms by which it affects endothelial cell viability. Ponatinib induced apoptosis and necrosis of HUVECs after 72 h. Dasatinib affected endothelial cells in vitro by inhibiting their proliferation and decreased wound closure as soon as 24 h of treatment and even at infra-therapeutic dose (0.005 microM). Comparatively, imatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib had little impact on endothelial cells at therapeutic concentrations. They did not induce apoptosis nor necrosis, even after 72 h of treatment but they inhibited HUVEC proliferation. Overall, this study reports various effects of BCR-ABL TKIs on endothelial cells and suggests that ponatinib and dasatinib induce arterial thrombosis through endothelial dysfunction.","['Haguet, Helene', 'Bouvy, Celine', 'Delvigne, Anne-Sophie', 'Modaffari, Elise', 'Wannez, Adeline', 'Sonveaux, Pierre', 'Dogne, Jean-Michel', 'Douxfils, Jonathan']","['Haguet H', 'Bouvy C', 'Delvigne AS', 'Modaffari E', 'Wannez A', 'Sonveaux P', 'Dogne JM', 'Douxfils J']","['Department of Pharmacy, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS), University of Namur, Namur, Belgium.', 'QUALIblood s.a., Namur, Belgium.', 'QUALIblood s.a., Namur, Belgium.', 'QUALIblood s.a., Namur, Belgium.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS), University of Namur, Namur, Belgium.', 'Pole of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique (IREC), Universite catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS), University of Namur, Namur, Belgium.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS), University of Namur, Namur, Belgium.', 'QUALIblood s.a., Namur, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor', 'atherosclerosis', 'cardiovascular', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'endothelial cells']",2020/07/29 06:00,2020/07/29 06:01,['2020/07/29 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2020.01007 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Jul 3;11:1007. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2020.01007. eCollection 2020.,,20200703,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Haguet, Bouvy, Delvigne, Modaffari, Wannez, Sonveaux, Dogne', 'and Douxfils.']",,PMC7350860,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, development of MAIT cells was also impaired in the absence of Bcl6. BCL-6-deficient iNKT cells had reduced expression of genes that were associated with the innate T cell lineage, including Zbtb16, which encodes PLZF, and PLZF-targeted genes. BCL-6 contributed to a chromatin accessibility landscape that was permissive for the expression of development-related genes and inhibitory for genes associated with naive T cell programs.

However, its role in adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs) is unclear. The adult intestinal epithelium has a high self-renewal rate driven by ISCs in crypts. Here, we find that LIF is present in the ISC niche in crypts and critical for the function of ISCs in maintaining the intestinal epithelial homeostasis and regeneration. Mechanistically, LIF maintains beta-catenin activity through the AKT/GSK3beta signaling to regulate ISC functions. LIF deficiency in mice impairs the renewal of the intestinal epithelium under the physiological condition. Further, LIF deficiency in mice impairs the regeneration of intestinal epithelium in response to radiation and shortens the lifespan of mice after high doses of radiation due to gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome, which can be rescued by administering recombinant LIF (rLIF). Importantly, LIF exhibits a radioprotective role in wild-type (WT) mice by protecting mice from lethal radiation-induced GI syndrome; administering rLIF promotes intestinal epithelial regeneration and prolongs survival in WT mice after radiation. These results reveal a previously unidentified and a crucial role of LIF in ensuring ISC function, promoting regeneration of the intestinal epithelium in response to radiation and protecting against radiation-induced GI syndrome.","['Wang, Huaying', 'Wang, Jianming', 'Zhao, Yuhan', 'Zhang, Xiao', 'Liu, Juan', 'Zhang, Cen', 'Haffty, Bruce', 'Verzi, Michael', 'Zhang, Lanjing', 'Gao, Nan', 'Feng, Zhaohui', 'Hu, Wenwei']","['Wang H', 'Wang J', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhang X', 'Liu J', 'Zhang C', 'Haffty B', 'Verzi M', 'Zhang L', 'Gao N', 'Feng Z', 'Hu W']","['Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, 08903, NJ, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, 08903, NJ, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, 08903, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, 07102, NJ, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, 08903, NJ, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, 08903, NJ, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, 08903, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, Piscataway, 08854, NJ, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, 08903, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, 07102, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Penn Medicine Princeton Medical Center, Plainsboro, 08536, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, 07102, NJ, USA.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, 08903, NJ, USA. fengzh@cinj.rutgers.edu.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, 08903, NJ, USA. wh221@cinj.rutgers.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Intestinal Mucosa/pathology/radiation effects', 'Intestine, Small/growth & development/pathology/radiation effects', 'Intestines/*pathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Organoids/growth & development/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Radiation Injuries/*prevention & control', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism/*radiation effects', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,,2020/07/29 06:00,2021/03/26 06:00,['2020/07/29 06:00'],"['2020/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-02790-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-02790-6 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Jul 27;11(7):588. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-02790-6.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7265-1764', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5529-1907']",20200727,,,"['R01 CA203965/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA160558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA227912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK102934/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK119198/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AT010243/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7385639,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incorporation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) into the standard treatment regimen for Philadelphia (Ph)-positive ALL significantly improved clinical outcomes. TKI-based induction chemotherapy, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) during the first complete remission (CR), is the standard of care for ALL patients. However, treatment with TKIs alone or TKIs plus low-intensity chemotherapy can achieve CR in some patients. Although this strategy is not enough to induce a deeper molecular response, it can reduce the incidence of treatment-related mortality. Despite promising results from pediatric trials, allogeneic HCT remains an important component of the treatment strategy for Ph-positive adult ALL. However, improving the highly sensitive BCR-ABL1 assays and introducing immunotherapy may decrease the demand for allogeneic HCT. Nevertheless, the treatment of Ph-positive ALL is still challenging, especially in cases with relapsed and refractory disease. Potent TKIs and monoclonal antibodies, such as blinatumomab and inotuzumab, have improved patient outcomes in relapse and refractory cases of ALL.

Actual chemotherapy may also contribute to differences in outcome. Retrospective studies have shown that AYA patients treated on pediatric-based regimens had higher survival than those treated with adult regimens; the superiority of pediatric protocols has also been proven in several prospective comparative trials. Increase in rate of enrollment of AYA patients in clinical trials may further improve outcome. Cure based on chemotherapy may further limit the role of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in AYA patients.

Sequential monitoring of MRD using sensitive and specific methods, such as real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or flow cytometry (FCM), has improved the assessment of treatment response and is currently used for therapeutic stratification and early detection. Although both FCM and qPCR yield highly consistent results with sensitivities of 10(4), each method has several limitations. For example, qPCR is time-consuming and laborious: designing primers that correspond to the immunoglobulin (IG) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements at diagnosis can take 34 weeks. In addition, the evolution of additional clones beyond the first or index clone during therapy cannot be detected, which might lead to false-negative results. FCM requires experienced technicians and sometimes does not achieve a sensitivity of 10(4). Accordingly, a next generation sequencing (NGS)-based method has been developed in an attempt to overcome these limitations. With the advent of high-throughput NGS technologies, a more in-depth analysis of IG and/or TCR gene rearrangements is now within reach, which impacts all applications of IG/TR analysis. However, standardization, quality control, and validation of this new technology are warranted prior to its incorporation into routine practice.","['Kim, In-Suk']",['Kim IS'],"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Yangsan, Korea.', 'Research Institute for Convergence of Biomedical Science and Technology, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Yangsan, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Immunoglobulin', 'Minimal residual diseases', 'Next generation sequencing', 'T-cell receptor']",2020/07/29 06:00,2020/07/29 06:01,['2020/07/29 06:00'],"['2019/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:01 [medline]']","['br.2020.S004 [pii]', '10.5045/br.2020.S004 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Res. 2020 Jul 31;55(S1):S19-S26. doi: 10.5045/br.2020.S004.,,,,,,PMC7386891,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, PROTACs have become an emerging technology for the development of novel targeted anticancer therapeutics. In fact, some of these reported PROTACs exhibit unprecedented efficacy and specificity in degrading various oncogenic proteins and have advanced to various stages of preclinical and clinical development for the treatment of cancer and hematologic malignancy. In this review, we systematically summarize the known PROTACs that have the potential to be used to treat various hematologic malignancies and discuss strategies to improve the safety of PROTACs for clinical application. Particularly, we propose to use the latest human pan-tissue single-cell RNA sequencing data to identify hematopoietic cell type-specific/selective E3 ligases to generate tumor-specific/selective PROTACs.

FLAMSA (fludarabine, Ara-C, and amsacrine) chemotherapy (CT) followed by reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) has been proposed as an effective and potentially safer alternative in this scenario. As improvements in supportive care have contributed to decreasing NRM rates after MAC, a comparative reassessment of these two strategies was performed. This was a registry-based analysis by the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. Eligibility criteria included age 18 to 50 years, primary refractory, first or second relapsed active AML, first allogeneic stem cell transplantation from a matched sibling donor (MSD) or an unrelated donor (UD) performed between 2005 and 2018, MAC or FLAMSA-RIC. A total of 1018 patients were included. The median patient age was 39 years (range, 18 to 50). Two hundred and fifty-eight patients received busulfan (Bu)/cyclophosphamide (Cy), 314 received Cy/total body irradiation (TBI), 318 received FLAMSA-TBI, and 128 received FLAMSA-CT. The median duration of follow-up was 50 months. In univariate analysis, the 2-year relapse incidence (RI) (54%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 50%-57%), leukemia-free survival (LFS) (30%; 95% CI, 27%-33%), and refined graft-versus-host disease-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) (21%; 95% CI, 18%-24%) were not significantly different between cohorts. Lower 2-year NRM was observed in the FLAMSA-CT group (7% versus 16% in Bu/Cy, 19% in Cy/TBI, and 18% in FLAMSA-TBI; P = .04), as well as increased 2-year overall survival (OS) (50% versus 33% in Bu/Cy, 34% in Cy/TBI, and 36% in FLAMSA-TBI; P = .03). These results were maintained in the multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR] for NRM: .40, P = .01; HR for OS: .65, P = .01; Bu/Cy as reference).

We aimed to evaluate the performance of the Myelofibrosis Transplant Scoring System (MTSS) and identify risk factors for survival in a multicenter series of 197 patients with MF undergoing allo-HCT. After a median follow-up of 3.1 years, 47% of patients had died, and the estimated 5-year survival rate was 51%. Projected 5-year risk of nonrelapse mortality and relapse incidence was 30% and 20%, respectively. Factors independently associated with increased mortality were a hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI) >/=3 and receiving a graft from an HLA-mismatched unrelated donor or cord blood, whereas post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) was associated with improved survival. Donor type was the only parameter included in the MTSS model with independent prognostic value for survival. According to the MTSS, 3-year survival was 62%, 66%, 37%, and 17% for low-, intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk groups, respectively. By pooling together the low- and intermediate-risk groups, as well as the high- and very high-risk groups, we pinpointed 2 categories: standard risk and high risk (25% of the series). Three-year survival was 62% in standard-risk and 25% in high-risk categories (P < .001). We derived a risk score based on the 3 independent risk factors for survival in our series (donor type, HCT-CI, and PT-Cy). The corresponding 5-year survival for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories was 79%, 55%, and 32%, respectively (P < .001). In conclusion, the MTSS model failed to clearly delineate 4 prognostic groups in our series but may still be useful to identify a subset of patients with poor outcome. We provide a simple prognostic scoring system for risk/benefit considerations before transplantation in patients with MF.","['Hernandez-Boluda, Juan-Carlos', 'Pereira, Arturo', 'Alvarez-Larran, Alberto', 'Martin, Ana-Africa', 'Benzaquen, Ana', 'Aguirre, Lourdes', 'Mora, Elvira', 'Gonzalez, Pedro', 'Mora, Jorge', 'Dorado, Nieves', 'Sampol, Antonia', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, Valentin', 'Lopez-Godino, Oriana', 'Fox, Maria-Laura', 'Reguera, Juan Luis', 'Perez-Encinas, Manuel', 'Pascual, Maria-Jesus', 'Xicoy, Blanca', 'Parody, Rocio', 'Gonzalez-Pinedo, Leslie', 'Espanol, Ignacio', 'Avendano, Alejandro', 'Correa, Juan-Gonzalo', 'Vallejo, Carlos', 'Jurado, Manuel', 'Garcia-Cadenas, Irene', 'Osorio, Santiago', 'Duran, Maria-Antonia', 'Sanchez-Guijo, Fermin', 'Cervantes, Francisco', 'Pinana, Jose-Luis']","['Hernandez-Boluda JC', 'Pereira A', 'Alvarez-Larran A', 'Martin AA', 'Benzaquen A', 'Aguirre L', 'Mora E', 'Gonzalez P', 'Mora J', 'Dorado N', 'Sampol A', 'Garcia-Gutierrez V', 'Lopez-Godino O', 'Fox ML', 'Reguera JL', 'Perez-Encinas M', 'Pascual MJ', 'Xicoy B', 'Parody R', 'Gonzalez-Pinedo L', 'Espanol I', 'Avendano A', 'Correa JG', 'Vallejo C', 'Jurado M', 'Garcia-Cadenas I', 'Osorio S', 'Duran MA', 'Sanchez-Guijo F', 'Cervantes F', 'Pinana JL']","['Hematology Department, Hospital Clinico Universitario, INCLIVA, University of Valencia, Valencia, Spain.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is very sensitive to cytotoxic damage. Retina tissue is easily affected by internal and external stimuli. However, the effect of AgNPs on human retinal cells is not known. This study examined the effect of AgNPs on ER stress induction and their mechanism of action in human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) ARPE-19 cells. We found that AgNPs significantly increased ARPE-19 cell cytotoxicity and stimulated caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, as well as mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization, in ARPE-19 cells in a dose-dependent manner (0.2-5 mug/mL for 18 h). AgNPs (5 mug/mL for 18 h) induced several signature ER stress markers, as indicated by the upregulated expressions of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP), phosphorylated protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha), and inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1), and cleaved activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). AgNPs also activated ASK1 and JNK in ARPE-19 cells, and induced increases in Bax and Puma expressions, as well as a decrease in Mcl-1 expression. However, inhibition of the ER stress response by pretreatment with 4-PBA included apparently and dose-dependently reduced levels of p-PERK, p-IRE1, CHOP, cleaved ATF6, p-ASK1, p-JNK, cleaved caspase-3, procaspase-12, and MMP depolarization in AgNP-treated ARPE-19 cells; it also led to significantly increased Mcl-1 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner in ARPE-19 cells. Pretreatment with JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly attenuated caspase-3 cleavage and MMP depolarization and increased Mcl-1 protein levels in AgNPs-treated ARPE-19 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Hence, our study demonstrated that AgNPs induced apoptosis in human RPE ARPE-19 cells by ER stress response and ER stress-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis via the IRE1/ASK1/JNK/Mcl-1 pathways.","['Quan, Juan-Hua', 'Gao, Fei Fei', 'Lee, Mina', 'Yuk, Jae-Min', 'Cha, Guang-Ho', 'Chu, Jia-Qi', 'Wang, Hao', 'Lee, Young-Ha']","['Quan JH', 'Gao FF', 'Lee M', 'Yuk JM', 'Cha GH', 'Chu JQ', 'Wang H', 'Lee YH']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, Guangdong 524001, China.', 'Department of Infection Biology and Department of Medical Science, Chungnam National University College of Medicine, Daejeon 35015, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chungnam National University, 33, Munhwa-ro, Jung-gu, Deajeon 35015, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Infection Biology and Department of Medical Science, Chungnam National University College of Medicine, Daejeon 35015, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Infection Biology and Department of Medical Science, Chungnam National University College of Medicine, Daejeon 35015, Republic of Korea.', 'Stem Cell Research and Cellular Therapy Center, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, Guangdong 524001, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, Guangdong 524001, China.

While elevated levels of Mcl-1 contribute to tumor cell survival and drug resistance, loss of Mcl-1 in cardiac myocytes leads to rapid mitochondrial dysfunction and heart failure development. Although Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein, previous studies indicate that its functions extend beyond regulating apoptosis. Mcl-1 is localized to both the mitochondrial outer membrane and matrix. Here, we have identified that Mcl-1 in the outer mitochondrial membrane mediates mitochondrial fission, which is independent of its anti-apoptotic function. We demonstrate that Mcl-1 interacts with Drp1 to promote mitochondrial fission in response to various challenges known to perturb mitochondria morphology. Induction of fission by Mcl-1 reduces nutrient deprivation-induced cell death and the protection is independent of its BH3 domain. Finally, cardiac-specific overexpression of Mcl-1OM, but not Mcl-1Matrix, contributes to a shift in the balance towards fission and leads to reduced exercise capacity, suggesting that a pre-existing fragmented mitochondrial network leads to decreased ability to adapt to an acute increase in workload and energy demand. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of Mcl-1 in maintaining mitochondrial health in cells.","['Moyzis, Alexandra G', 'Lally, Navraj S', 'Liang, Wenjing', 'Leon, Leonardo J', 'Najor, Rita H', 'Orogo, Amabel M', 'Gustafsson, Asa B']","['Moyzis AG', 'Lally NS', 'Liang W', 'Leon LJ', 'Najor RH', 'Orogo AM', 'Gustafsson AB']","['Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.', 'Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.', 'Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.', 'Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.', 'Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.', 'Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.', 'Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States of America.

However, ambiguous immunophenotypes are common and remain a diagnostic challenge. Therefore, we evaluated the diagnostic benefit of measuring CD200 and CD43 expression together with the standard MS antigens. METHODS: 138 lymphoma patient samples and a validation cohort of 138 additive samples were classified according to the standard MS and further assigned with one or two additional points, for high CD200 and/or CD43 expression levels. The ""classical"" MS and the ""Matutes score-extended"" (MS-e) were categorized as high (4-5/6-7), intermediate (2-3/4-5), and low (0-1/0-3). Samples were reclassified into the MS-e with focus on ambiguous cases with an intermediate ""classical"" MS. RESULTS: A total of 35 of 138 (25.4%) patient samples were assigned to the intermediate MS group and confirmed by histopathological reports as CLL (14/40.0%) and B-NHLs other than CLL (21/60%). MS-e analysis identified 13 of 14 (92.9%) of CLL cases (MS-e 4-5) and 18/21 (85.7%) non-CLL cases (MS-e </= 3) correctly. Overall, the sensitivity of the CLL diagnosis was significantly increased by application of MS-e compared to the ""classical"" MS (98.8% vs. 82.7%; p = 0.0009), while specificity of both methods was almost equal (94.7% vs. 98.3%; p = 0.4795). Of note, sole measurement of CD43 and CD200 on B-cells sufficiently differentiated CLL from non-CLL with a test accuracy superior to the ""classical"" MS (F1 score 96.2 vs. 93.6).

The number of reports of DCHD has been increasing in the last decade, which likely reflects the growing number of HSCTs and the improved ability to identify the donor cell origin. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hematological disorder arising in the context of clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells harboring a somatic mutation in phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class A. We report here a patient with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, who developed PNH 7 years after umbilical cord blood transplantation. The patient has maintained complete remission with full-donor chimerism after HSCT. Thus, PNH was derived from stem cells of donor origin. The immature immune environment in the recipient after cord blood transplantation might have contributed to the rapid clonal expansion for neonatal stem cells in cord blood to develop typical symptomatic PNH in a short period. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of a case of PNH that developed in donor stem cells after HSCT.","['Nakaya, Yosuke', 'Nakao, Takafumi', 'Ueda, Yasutaka', 'Takamori, Hiroyuki', 'Nishimura, Jun-Ichi', 'Tatsumi, Naoko', 'Tsutsumi, Minako', 'Yoshida, Masahiro', 'Yoshimura, Takuro', 'Hayashi, Yoshiki', 'Yamane, Takahisa']","['Nakaya Y', 'Nakao T', 'Ueda Y', 'Takamori H', 'Nishimura JI', 'Tatsumi N', 'Tsutsumi M', 'Yoshida M', 'Yoshimura T', 'Hayashi Y', 'Yamane T']","['Department of Hematology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol glycan-class A protein)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mutation', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",['NOTNLM'],"['clonal expansion', 'cord blood transplantation', 'paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2020/07/28 06:00'],"['2020/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13498 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 Nov;105(5):659-661. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13498.

Approximately 50% of patients who achieve deep molecular response (DMR) remain in treatment-free remission (TFR) even after discontinuation of TKIs. Although TKIs may achieve clinical ""cure"" after TKI treatment for specific periods, there are no reliable biomarkers for predicting the response to TKIs and the probability of TFR in CML. An increase in natural killer (NK) cells in the peripheral blood of TKI-treated CML patients is correlated with better outcomes, suggesting that TKIs induce antitumor NK cell immunity against CML cells. Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are highly polymorphic NK cell receptors that play important roles in the regulation of immune responses. The identification of allelic polymorphisms of KIRs by next-generation sequencing uncovered novel aspects of KIRs. Here we summarize the current knowledge of the genetic and immunological aspects of KIRs and discuss the association between allelic polymorphisms of KIRs and TKI-treated CML.","['Shindo, Takero', 'Ureshino, Hiroshi', 'Kojima, Hiroto', 'Tanaka, Hidenori', 'Kimura, Shinya']","['Shindo T', 'Ureshino H', 'Kojima H', 'Tanaka H', 'Kimura S']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.', 'HLA Foundation Laboratory, Kyoto, Japan.', 'HLA Foundation Laboratory, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Respiratory Medicine and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University, Saga, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Immunol Med,Immunological medicine,101736847,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/*immunology', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'antitumor immunity', 'killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)', 'natural killer (NK) cell', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/12/16 06:00,['2020/07/28 06:00'],"['2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/25785826.2020.1796062 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Med. 2021 Jun;44(2):61-68. doi: 10.1080/25785826.2020.1796062.

The single X-ray crystallography of the complex revealed the square pyramidal coordination geometry with P21 space group with axial water molecule ligated to copper centre. The geometry of the complex was further validated by DFT calculations, which was in accordance with other spectroscopic studies. The binding profile of the complex with ct-DNA and tRNA was carried out by employing various biophysical (absorption, fluorescence, circular dichroism, morphological studies) and computational studies (DFT, molecular docking). The experimental results revealed efficient binding of the complex with both ct-DNA and tRNA primarily, via non-covalent interactions. The binding studies Kb and K values revealed 10-fold greater binding affinity of the complex for tRNA as compared to ct-DNA. The in silico molecular docking further validated the interaction of complex within the hydrophobic pocket of ct-DNA and tRNA. The concentration and time dependent cleavage studies of DNA and tRNA were performed by employing gel electrophoresis assay. The cytotoxic activity of the complex was performed on a panel of human cell lines viz., leukemia (K-562), pancreatic (MIA-PA-CA-2), hepatoma (Hep-G2), cervical (HeLa), and breast (MDA-MB-231) by SRB assay. The complex exhibited selectively remarkably good cytotoxic potential on leukemia (K-562), cervical (HeLa) and hepatoma (Hep-G2) cancer cell lines.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

METHODS: OCM methodology was applied to the Medicare 20% sample data to identify 6-month patient episodes triggered by chemotherapy in 2012-2015. Proportions of episodes with hospitalization or ED/OB stays, reasons for hospitalization, and discharge destinations were summarized. RESULTS: Of 485,186 6-month episodes for 255,229 patients in 13,823 practices, 25% of episodes led to >/=1 hospitalization (from 14% in breast cancer to 56% in acute leukemia), and 23% to ED/OB stays (from 18% in breast cancer to 36% in liver cancer). In 2995 practices with >/=20 total episodes, practice-level proportions of episodes with hospitalization ranged from 14% to 31% (20th-80th percentile) and with ED/OB stays from 17% to 29%. For all cancers combined, the most frequent reasons for hospitalization were infection (13%), anemia (7%), dehydration (5%), and congestive heart failure (3%); the most common discharge destinations were home (71%) followed by a skilled nursing facility (13%), death (6%), and hospice (5%). Reasons for hospitalization and discharge destinations varied by cancer type; acute leukemia episodes led to the highest rates of infection and anemia, and central nervous system tumor episodes to the highest proportions of death or hospice discharge. CONCLUSION: The variations in frequency of and reasons for hospitalization, ED/OB stays, and hospitalization discharge destinations across cancer types should be considered when evaluating OCM practice performance.","['Li, Shuling', 'Peng, Yi', 'Liu, Jiannong', 'Li, Suying', 'Raskin, Leon', 'Kelsh, Michael A', 'Zaha, Rebecca', 'Gawade, Prasad L', 'Henry, David', 'Lyman, Gary H']","['Li S', 'Peng Y', 'Liu J', 'Li S', 'Raskin L', 'Kelsh MA', 'Zaha R', 'Gawade PL', 'Henry D', 'Lyman GH']","['Chronic Disease Research Group (CDRG), Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Chronic Disease Research Group (CDRG), Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Chronic Disease Research Group (CDRG), Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Chronic Disease Research Group (CDRG), Hennepin Healthcare Research Institute, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Center for Observation Research, Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Center for Observation Research, Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Center for Observation Research, Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Center for Observation Research, Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Emergency Service, Hospital/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Medicare', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Medicare', '*Oncology Care Model', '*discharge destination', '*hospitalization']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2020/07/28 06:00'],"['2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/03007995.2020.1801403 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2020 Sep;36(9):1519-1527. doi: 10.1080/03007995.2020.1801403.

P-gp has been identified as an efflux pump involved in releasing of IM outside CML cells. To date, the P-gp involvement in the IM resistance development was not completely understood. Therefore, the present study aimed at measuring the P-gp expression level on lymphocytes from Tunisian patients with CML and correlating this level with a molecular response to IM. METHOD: The expression of P-gp on peripheral blood lymphocytes from 59 Tunisian patients with CML (27 IM responder patients vs 32 IM non-responder patients) was evaluated by flow cytometry. RESULT: Our finding showed significantly positive expression of P-gp in the lymphocytes from the IM non-responder group when compared to the IM-responder group (P = .001). In IM non-responder CML patients, the comparison between CCyR achievers and non-achievers showed a high mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of P-gp expression in patients who did not achieve their CCyR (P = .001). The comparison between patients with primary and secondary resistance to IM showed an increasing MFI value in patients with primary resistance to IM (P = .001).

However, the anticancer activities of dimeric acridone alkaloids with unique structures and the molecular mechanism of these effects are poorly understood. METHODS: We investigated the cytotoxicity effects of dimeric acridone alkaloids isolated from Marsh grapefruit on human myeloid leukaemia HL-60 cells. KEY FINDINGS: Of the six dimeric acridone alkaloids tested, citbismine-E, the most potent, dose- and time-dependently decreased HL-60 cell viability by inducing apoptosis. The treatment of HL-60 cells with citbismine-E yielded a significant increase in levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Citbismine-E lowered the mitochondrial membrane potential and increased the activities of caspase-9 and -3. In addition, citbismine-E-induced apoptosis, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase activation were significantly alleviated by pretreatment of the cells with antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Citbismine-E induced intrinsic caspase-dependent apoptosis through ROS-mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation. Citbismine-E-induced production of oxidative stress biomarkers, malondialdehyde and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine was also attenuated by pretreatment with NAC. CONCLUSIONS: Citbismine-E is a powerful cytotoxic agent against HL-60 cells that acts by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated apoptosis through ROS-dependent JNK activation. Citbismine-E also induced oxidative stress damage via ROS-mediated lipid peroxidation and DNA damage in HL-60 cells.","['Murata, Tomiyasu', 'Kohno, Susumu', 'Ogawa, Kazuma', 'Ito, Chihiro', 'Itoigawa, Masataka', 'Ito, Masafumi', 'Hikita, Kiyomi', 'Kaneda, Norio']","['Murata T', 'Kohno S', 'Ogawa K', 'Ito C', 'Itoigawa M', 'Ito M', 'Hikita K', 'Kaneda N']","['Laboratory of Analytical Neurobiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Oncology and Molecular Biology, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Faculty of Science and Technology, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Natural Products Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'School of Sport and Health Science, Tokai Gakuen University, Miyoshi, Japan.', 'Faculty of Science and Technology, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Analytical Neurobiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Analytical Neurobiology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (Acridones)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '6BK306GUQA (acridone)']",IM,"['Acridones/isolation & purification/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Alkaloids/isolation & purification/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', '*Citrus paradisi', 'Cytotoxins', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['Citbismine-E', 'HL-60 cells', 'apoptosis', 'c-Jun N-terminal kinase', 'reactive oxygen species']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/06/23 06:00,['2020/07/28 06:00'],"['2020/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jphp.13327 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2020 Oct;72(10):1445-1457. doi: 10.1111/jphp.13327.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records at a single referral centre were retrospectively reviewed for dogs diagnosed with infiltrative laryngeal disease by CT or laryngoscopy. RESULTS: Fifteen dogs were included, with a median age of 6 years (range 1-14 years). Thirteen dogs were diagnosed with inflammatory disease including granulation tissue (n = 4) and neutrophilic (n = 2), septic neutrophilic (n = 2), eosinophilic (n = 1) lymphocytic/plasmacytic (n = 1) and mixed/unclassified (n = 3) inflammation. One dog was diagnosed with large cell lymphoma and one dog was diagnosed with mast cell tumour. Twelve dogs survived to discharge. Follow-up was available for 10 dogs diagnosed with inflammatory disease. Four had fully recovered (7, 10, 23 and 32 months) and one dog developed acute leukaemia and was euthanased at 2 months. Five dogs had recurrence of clinical signs at 1, 1, 5, 17 and 26 months. The dog with lymphoma was euthanased at 8 months and the dog with mast cell tumour died at 5 months. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In this cohort, infiltrative inflammatory lesions of the larynx were more common than neoplastic infiltration. For dogs that survived to discharge, outcome was fair although relapse was common.","['Dixon, A', 'Tivers, M S', 'Packham, L', 'Black, V']","['Dixon A', 'Tivers MS', 'Packham L', 'Black V']","['Small Animal Referral Hospital, University of Bristol, Langford House, Langford, BS40 5DU, UK.', 'Paragon Veterinary Referrals, Paragon Business Village, Red Hall Crescent, Wakefield, WF1 2DF, UK.', 'Small Animal Referral Hospital, University of Bristol, Langford House, Langford, BS40 5DU, UK.', 'Langford Veterinary Services, Small Animal Referral Hospital, Langford House, Langford, BS40 5DU, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Small Anim Pract,The Journal of small animal practice,0165053,,IM,"['Animals', '*Dog Diseases', 'Dogs', '*Laryngeal Diseases/veterinary', '*Larynx', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/veterinary', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2020/07/28 06:00,2020/10/27 06:00,['2020/07/28 06:00'],"['2020/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jsap.13190 [doi]'],ppublish,J Small Anim Pract. 2020 Sep;61(9):568-575. doi: 10.1111/jsap.13190.

It was first approved in 2016 for the treatment of relapsed and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Later, the indications expanded, and multiple research as well as clinical studies are still conducted involving venetoclax. No analytical method for the determination of venetoclax can currently be found in the literature. We developed a mass spectrometry-compatible stability-indicating ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (LC) method for venetoclax. The LC method was developed using analytical quality by design principles. The developed method is able to separate venetoclax and its degradation products. The method was validated in the working point where a linearity range was established and accuracy, repeatability, and selectivity were assessed. Venetoclax is the only Bcl-2 protein inhibitor on the market. It is very effective in combinational therapy, so future drug development involving venetoclax may be expected. A stability-indicating method could aid in the development of new pharmaceutical products with venetoclax.","['Zigart, Nina', 'Casar, Zdenko']","['Zigart N', 'Casar Z']","['Sandoz Development Center Slovenia, Analytics Department, Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d., SI-1526 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Chair of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Ljubljana, Askerceva cesta 7, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Sandoz Development Center Slovenia, Analytics Department, Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d., SI-1526 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Chair of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Ljubljana, Askerceva cesta 7, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,ACS Omega,ACS omega,101691658,,,,,,2020/07/28 06:00,2020/07/28 06:01,['2020/07/28 06:00'],"['2020/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1021/acsomega.0c02338 [doi]'],epublish,ACS Omega. 2020 Jul 9;5(28):17726-17742. doi: 10.1021/acsomega.0c02338. eCollection 2020 Jul 21.,,20200709,,['Copyright (c) 2020 American Chemical Society.'],,PMC7377371,,,['The authors declare no competing financial interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Observations: An eight year-old girl presented with tibial pain and bone lesion five years after multimodal treatment of bilateral retinoblastoma, initially clinically suspicious of osteomyelitis. Histopathological examination of bone biopsy specimen revealed a highly proliferative small blue round cell tumor mimicking Ewing's sarcoma of bone. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of a distant metastasis of the previous retinoblastoma. Other subsequent primary malignancies presenting as small blue round cell tumors, such as sarcomas or leukemia, were excluded by immunohistochemistry and molecular methods. Conclusions and importance: In countries with early diagnosis of retinoblastoma, distant metastases of retinoblastoma are extremely rare, whereas subsequent primary malignancies are common in survivors of heritable retinoblastoma. Immunohistochemistry and molecular pathology are essential components of diagnostic pathway. In retinoblastoma patients, distant metastases including osseous lesions should be included in the differential diagnosis of small blue round cell tumors.","['Ting, Saskia C', 'Kiefer, Tobias', 'Ehlert, Karoline', 'Goericke, Sophia L', 'Hinze, Raoul', 'Ketteler, Petra', 'Bechrakis, Nikolaos E', 'Schildhaus, Hans-Ulrich']","['Ting SC', 'Kiefer T', 'Ehlert K', 'Goericke SL', 'Hinze R', 'Ketteler P', 'Bechrakis NE', 'Schildhaus HU']","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, University Medicine Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology and Neuroradiology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Helios Clinics Schwerin, Germany.', 'Pediatrics III, Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg, Essen, Germany.', 'West German Cancer Center (WTZ), Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],United States,Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep,American journal of ophthalmology case reports,101679941,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Immunohistochemistry', 'Metastasis', 'Retinoblastoma', 'Small blue round cell tumor', 'Subsequent primary malignancy']",2020/07/28 06:00,2020/07/28 06:01,['2020/07/28 06:00'],"['2020/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ajoc.2020.100834 [doi]', 'S2451-9936(20)30157-2 [pii]', '100834 [pii]']",epublish,Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep. 2020 Jul 17;19:100834. doi: 10.1016/j.ajoc.2020.100834. eCollection 2020 Sep.,,20200717,,['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],,PMC7374179,,,['All authors have no financial disclosures.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The need has thus arisen for the development of computational methods aimed at improving cancer subtyping and biomarker identification from multi-modal data. Here we apply the Integrative Network Fusion (INF) pipeline, which combines multiple omics layers exploiting Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) within a machine learning predictive framework. INF includes a feature ranking scheme (rSNF) on SNF-integrated features, used by a classifier over juxtaposed multi-omics features (juXT). In particular, we show instances of INF implementing Random Forest (RF) and linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) as the classifier, and two baseline RF and LSVM models are also trained on juXT. A compact RF model, called rSNFi, trained on the intersection of top-ranked biomarkers from the two approaches juXT and rSNF is finally derived. All the classifiers are run in a 10x5-fold cross-validation schema to warrant reproducibility, following the guidelines for an unbiased Data Analysis Plan by the US FDA-led initiatives MAQC/SEQC. INF is demonstrated on four classification tasks on three multi-modal TCGA oncogenomics datasets. Gene expression, protein expression and copy number variants are used to predict estrogen receptor status (BRCA-ER, N = 381) and breast invasive carcinoma subtypes (BRCA-subtypes, N = 305), while gene expression, miRNA expression and methylation data is used as predictor layers for acute myeloid leukemia and renal clear cell carcinoma survival (AML-OS, N = 157; KIRC-OS, N = 181). In test, INF achieved similar Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) values and 97% to 83% smaller feature sizes (FS), compared with juXT for BRCA-ER (MCC: 0.83 vs. 0.80; FS: 56 vs. 1801) and BRCA-subtypes (0.84 vs. 0.80; 302 vs. 1801), improving KIRC-OS performance (0.38 vs. 0.31; 111 vs. 2319). INF predictions are generally more accurate in test than one-dimensional omics models, with smaller signatures too, where transcriptomics consistently play the leading role. Overall, the INF framework effectively integrates multiple data levels in oncogenomics classification tasks, improving over the performance of single layers alone and naive juxtaposition, and provides compact signature sizes.","['Chierici, Marco', 'Bussola, Nicole', 'Marcolini, Alessia', 'Francescatto, Margherita', 'Zandona, Alessandro', 'Trastulla, Lucia', 'Agostinelli, Claudio', 'Jurman, Giuseppe', 'Furlanello, Cesare']","['Chierici M', 'Bussola N', 'Marcolini A', 'Francescatto M', 'Zandona A', 'Trastulla L', 'Agostinelli C', 'Jurman G', 'Furlanello C']","['Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy.', 'Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy.', 'University of Trento, Trento, Italy.', 'Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy.', 'Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'NIDEK Technologies Srl, Albignasego (PD), Italy.', 'Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Munich, Germany.', 'University of Trento, Trento, Italy.', 'Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy.', 'Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy.', 'HK3 Lab, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['classification', 'multi-omics', 'network', 'oncogenomics', 'predictive modeling']",2020/07/28 06:00,2020/07/28 06:01,['2020/07/28 06:00'],"['2020/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.01065 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jun 30;10:1065. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01065. eCollection 2020.,,20200630,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Chierici, Bussola, Marcolini, Francescatto, Zandona,', 'Trastulla, Agostinelli, Jurman and Furlanello.']",,PMC7340129,,,,['figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.12052995.v1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It exerts remarkable anticancer activity and induces apoptotic cell death in various human cancer cells. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of TET on the inhibition of tumor growth and the induction of apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer in xenograft mice. Tumor weight and volume were measured. The histopathological changes in the tumor tissue were observed. Immunohistochemistry analysis of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) was carried out. The expression of apoptosis-associated genes and proteins, such as cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease-3 (Caspase-3), Survivin, Bax, Bcl-2, BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid), and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. TET inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis in TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. The mechanism underlying this effect might be mediated by TET-upregulated Caspase-3, Bax, and Bid and downregulated by Bcl-2, Survivin, and PARP. Taken together, this study supported the fact that TET is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of TNBC, thereby providing experimental evidence for its use in the treatment of breast cancer.","['Wang, Chun-Hui', 'Yang, Jia-Min', 'Guo, Yu-Bo', 'Shen, Jing', 'Pei, Xiao-Hua']","['Wang CH', 'Yang JM', 'Guo YB', 'Shen J', 'Pei XH']","['The Fanshan Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 102488, China.', 'Beijing Vocational College of Labour and Social Security, Beijing 100029, China.', 'Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China.', 'The Fanshan Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 102488, China.', 'The Fanshan Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 102488, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,,,2020/07/28 06:00,2020/07/28 06:01,['2020/07/28 06:00'],"['2020/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/6823520 [doi]'],epublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2020 Jun 30;2020:6823520. doi: 10.1155/2020/6823520. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6686-1696', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7670-1979', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9724-1649', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3043-8874']",20200630,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Chun-hui Wang et al.'],,PMC7345956,,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although effective, major obstacles involve the complex and costly individualized manufacturing process, and CD19 target antigen loss or modulation leading to resistant and relapse following CAR therapy. A potential solution for these limitations is the use of donor-derived gammadeltaT cells as a CAR backbone. gammadeltaT cells lack allogenecity and are safely used in haploidentical transplants. Moreover, gammadeltaT cells are known to mediate natural anti-tumor responses. Here, we describe a 14-day production process initiated from peripheral-blood mononuclear cells, leading to a median 185-fold expansion of gammadelta T cells with high purity (>98% CD3+ and >99% gammadeltaTCR+). CAR transduction efficacy of gammadelta T cells was equally high when compared to standard CAR-T cells (60.5 +/- 13.2 and 65.3 +/- 18.3%, respectively). CD19-directed gammadeltaCAR-T cells were effective against CD19+ cell lines in vitro and in vivo, showing cytokine production, direct target killing, and clearance of bone marrow leukemic cells in an NSG model. Multiple injections of gammadeltaCAR-T cells and priming of mice with zoledronate lead to enhanced tumor reduction in vivo. Unlike standard CD19 CAR-T cells, gammadeltaCAR-T cells were able to target CD19 antigen negative leukemia cells, an effect that was enhanced after priming the cells with zoledronate. In conclusion, gammadeltaCAR-T cell production is feasible and leads to highly pure and efficient effector cells. gammadeltaCAR-T cell may provide a promising platform in the allogeneic setting, and may target leukemic cells also after antigen loss.","['Rozenbaum, Meir', 'Meir, Amilia', 'Aharony, Yarden', 'Itzhaki, Orit', 'Schachter, Jacob', 'Bank, Ilan', 'Jacoby, Elad', 'Besser, Michal J']","['Rozenbaum M', 'Meir A', 'Aharony Y', 'Itzhaki O', 'Schachter J', 'Bank I', 'Jacoby E', 'Besser MJ']","['Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Ella Lemelbaum Institute for Immuno Oncology, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Center for Pediatric Cell Therapy, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'Center for Pediatric Cell Therapy, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'Center for Pediatric Cell Therapy, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'Ella Lemelbaum Institute for Immuno Oncology, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Ella Lemelbaum Institute for Immuno Oncology, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Rheumatology Unit, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'Center for Pediatric Cell Therapy, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Sheba Medical Center, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Tel Hashomer, Israel."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Ella Lemelbaum Institute for Immuno Oncology, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Wohl Institute of Translational Medicine, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Genetic Engineering/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', '*Leukemia', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell malignancies', '*chimeric antigen receptor', '*gamma-delta T cells', '*immuno oncology', '*leukemia']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/07/28 06:00'],"['2020/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.01347 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Jul 2;11:1347. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.01347. eCollection 2020.,,20200702,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Rozenbaum, Meir, Aharony, Itzhaki, Schachter, Bank, Jacoby and', 'Besser.']",,PMC7343910,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism of ANRIL in the progression of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) has not been clarified clearly. Methods: qRT-PCR was performed to detect ANRIL expression in T-ALL samples. T-ALL cell lines (MOLT4, CCRF-CEM and KOPT-K1) were used as the cell models. The function of ANRIL on T-ALL cells was investigated by CCK-8 assays, Transwell assays, and apoptosis experiments in vitro. qRT-PCR, Western blot, luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay were used to confirm the interactions between ANRIL and miR-7-5p, miR-7-5p and its target gene transcription factor 4 (TCF4). Results: ANRIL was significantly up-regulated in T-ALL samples. Its knockdown markedly inhibited viability, migration and invasion of T-ALL cells, but its overexpression exerted the opposite effects. TCF4 was proved to be a target gene of miR-7-5p. ANRIL down-regulated miR-7-5p via sponging it and in turn up-regulated TCF4. Conclusions: LncRNA ANRIL can modulate malignant phenotypes of T-ALL cells, possibly by regulating miR-7-5p/TCF4 axis, and it serves as a potential therapeutic target for T-ALL.","['Li, Gang', 'Gao, Lan', 'Zhao, Jing', 'Liu, Dejun', 'Li, Hui', 'Hu, Min']","['Li G', 'Gao L', 'Zhao J', 'Liu D', 'Li H', 'Hu M']","[""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Weiwu Road, No. 7, Zhengzhou, Henan 450003 China.grid.414011.1"", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Weiwu Road, No. 7, Zhengzhou, Henan 450003 China.grid.414011.1"", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Weiwu Road, No. 7, Zhengzhou, Henan 450003 China.grid.414011.1"", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Weiwu Road, No. 7, Zhengzhou, Henan 450003 China.grid.414011.1"", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Weiwu Road, No. 7, Zhengzhou, Henan 450003 China.grid.414011.1"", ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Weiwu Road, No. 7, Zhengzhou, Henan 450003 China.grid.414011.1""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ANRIL', 'T-ALL', 'lncRNAs', 'miR-7-5p']",2020/07/28 06:00,2020/07/28 06:01,['2020/07/28 06:00'],"['2019/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-020-01376-8 [doi]', '1376 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2020 Jul 23;20:335. doi: 10.1186/s12935-020-01376-8. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3739-1108'],20200723,,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,PMC7376839,,,['Competing interestsThe authors announce that there are no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Former researches had confirmed the pre-leukemia transcription factor 3 (PBX3) was involved in maintaining the characteristics of liver cancer stem cell. We found that PBX3 is an extremely unstable protein with a short half-life in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Unstable proteins are believed to be susceptible to degradation by ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, when we treated hepatoma cells using the proteasome inhibitor MG132, found the levels of PBX3 protein and mRNA were significantly downregulated, suggesting that PBX3 protein is not degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our study aims to investigate the mechanism of MG132 regulation of PBX3. We observed that the levels of miR-424, let-7c, miR-222, miR-200b were upregulated when hepatoma cells were treated with MG132, and this increase was negatively correlated with the levels of PBX3. Using the miRWalk algorithm, previous studies have predicted that these miRNAs target the PBX3 gene. Thus, we investigated the mechanism by which the proteasome inhibitor MG132 regulates these miRNAs. It has been reported that the Argonaute2 protein is an important component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and it can regulate the levels of certain miRNAs. Consequently, we also investigated whether the proteasome inhibitor regulates related miRNAs by stabilizing Argonaute2. Using co-infection, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and western blot assays, we found that MG132 stabilizes the expression of the Argonuate2 protein by inhibiting its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In summary, the PBX3 protein, which is closely linked to the stemness of hepatoma cells, does not undergo degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPM).","['Mou, Daiyong', 'Yang, Xiaodan', 'Li, Sheng', 'Zhao, Wei', 'Li, Meng', 'Zhao, Maoji', 'Alotaibi, Nasser Hadal', 'Zhang, Zhiqian', 'Tang, Min', 'Alharbi, Khalid Saad', 'Bahman, Joob', 'Bukhari, Syed Nasir Abbas', 'Dezlla, Cristina']","['Mou D', 'Yang X', 'Li S', 'Zhao W', 'Li M', 'Zhao M', 'Alotaibi NH', 'Zhang Z', 'Tang M', 'Alharbi KS', 'Bahman J', 'Bukhari SNA', 'Dezlla C']","['Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Clinical Laboratory of Nanchong Central Hospital, Nanchong 637000, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational.

It has been shown that the downregulation of Fas expression is correlated with an inadequate response in ALL, although these mechanisms are still not well understood. Several reports demonstrated that hypoxia is involved in dysfunctional apoptosis. Yin-Yang-1 (YY1) transcription factor is involved in resistance to apoptosis, tumor progression, and it is increased in different types of cancer, including leukemia. The regulatory mechanism underlying YY1 expression in leukemia is still not understood, but it is known that YY1 negatively regulates Fas expression. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of YY1 on Fas expression under hypoxic conditions in ALL. Methods: Leukemia cell line RS4; 11 was cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. YY1, Fas receptor, and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1alpha) expression were analyzed. After treatment with a Fas agonist (DX2), apoptosis was analyzed through the detection of active caspase 3. Data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation. Results: Leukemia cells co-expressed both HIF-1alpha and YY1 under hypoxia, which correlated with a downregulation of Fas expression. During hypoxia, the levels of apoptosis diminished after DX2 treatment. The analysis revealed that patients with high levels of HIF-1alpha also express high levels of YY1 and low levels of Fas. Conclusions: These results suggest that YY1 negatively regulates the expression of the Fas receptor, which could be involved in the escape of leukemic cells from the immune response contributing to the ALL pathogenesis.","['Martinez-Torres, Estefany', 'Lopez-Perez, Tania V', 'Morales-Martinez, Mario', 'Huerta-Yepez, Sara']","['Martinez-Torres E', 'Lopez-Perez TV', 'Morales-Martinez M', 'Huerta-Yepez S']","['Unidad de Investigacion en Enfermedades Oncologicas, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion en Enfermedades Oncologicas, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT), Unidad de Investigacion en Enfermedades Oncologicas, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Senalizacion Molecular en Cancer Molecular, Hospital de Oncologia, Centro Medico Nacional de Mexico Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion en Enfermedades Oncologicas, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Mexico,Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,0414106,"['0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (YY1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (YY1 protein, human)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Hypoxia/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Hypoxia/physiology', 'YY1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'fas Receptor/agonists/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Fas', '*HIF-1alpha', '*Hipoxia', '*Hypoxia', '*Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha', '*Leucemia linfoblastica aguda', '*YY1', '*Yin-Yang-1']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/10/09 06:00,['2020/07/28 06:00'],"['2020/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/09 06:00 [medline]']","['j77/4/186 [pii]', '10.24875/BMHIM.19000187 [doi]']",ppublish,Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex. 2020;77(4):186-194. doi: 10.24875/BMHIM.19000187.,,,,['Copyright: (c) 2020 Permanyer.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,YY1 induce la disminucion de la apoptosis a traves de Fas en la leucemia linfoblastica aguda en condiciones hipoxicas: implicaciones en la evasion de la respuesta inmunitaria.,,,,,

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis comparing time outside hospital, OS and end-of-life care in AML patients >/=60 years treated with intensive chemotherapy (IC), hypomethylating agents (HMA) and best supportive care (BSC) in a tertiary hospital. RESULTS: Of 201 patients diagnosed between 2005 and 2015, 54% received IC while 14% and 32% were treated with HMA and BSC respectively. Median OS was significantly higher in patients treated with IC and HMA compared with BSC (11.5 versus 16.2 versus 1.3 months; p < .0001). Median number of hospital admissions for the entire cohort was 3 (1-17) and patients spent <50% of their life after the diagnosis in the hospital setting. Compared to BSC, IC (HR 0.27, p < .0001) and HMA therapy (HR 0.16, p < .0001) were associated with the lower likelihood of spending at least 25% of survival time in hospital. Although 66% patients were referred to palliative care, the interval between referral to death was 24 (1-971) days and 46% patients died in the hospital. CONCLUSION: Older patients with AML, irrespective of treatment, require intensive health care resources, are more likely to die in hospital and less likely to use hospice services. Older AML patients treated with disease modifying therapy survive longer than those receiving BSC, and spend >50% of survival time outside the hospital. These data are informative for counselling older patients with AML.","['Sharplin, Kirsty', 'Wee, Li Yan A', 'Singhal, Deepak', 'Edwards, Suzanne', 'Danner, Silke', 'Lewis, Ian', 'Thomas, Daniel', 'Wei, Andrew', 'Yong, Agnes S M', 'Hiwase, Devendra K']","['Sharplin K', 'Wee LYA', 'Singhal D', 'Edwards S', 'Danner S', 'Lewis I', 'Thomas D', 'Wei A', 'Yong ASM', 'Hiwase DK']","['Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Port Road, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Port Road, Adelaide, Australia; Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Port Road, Adelaide, Australia; School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Public Health, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Port Road, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Alfred Hospital and Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia; School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Haematology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Port Road, Adelaide, Australia; Precision Medicine Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia; School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.

Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) is an emerging suppressor of inflammatory responses. CCL21-CCR7 signaling mediates tolerance development. However, whether PLZF and CCL21-CCR7 are required for the development of asthma tolerance is unknown. Here, we found that Zbtb16 (coding PLZF) and Ccl21 were upregulated in OVA-induced asthma tolerance (OT) lungs by RNA-seq. PLZF physically interacted with GATA3 and its expression was higher in GATA3(+) Th2 cells and ILC2s in OT lungs. Zbtb16-knockdown in lymphocytes promoted the differentiation of CD3e(+) CD4(+) T cells, particularly those producing IL-4 and IL-5. Moreover, iNKT cells with high expression of PLZF were recruited into the lungs via draining lymph nodes during tolerance. Blockade of CCL21-CCR7 signaling in OT mice decreased the PLZF(+) cell population, abolished CCR7-induced PLZF(+) iNKT recruitment to the lungs, enhanced Th2responses and exacerbated lung pathology. In OT mice, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection impeded PLZF(+) cell and CCR7(+) PLZF(+) iNKT cellrecruitment to the lungs and increased airway resistance. Collectively, these results indicate that PLZF could interact with GATA3 and restrain differentiation of IL-4- and IL-5-producing T cells, iNKT cells with high PLZF expression are recruited to the lungs via CCL21-CCR7 signaling to facilitate the development of asthma tolerance.","['Feng, Xintong', 'Zhao, Caiqi', 'Li, Ling', 'Feng, Jingjing', 'He, Wei', 'Shi, Tianyun', 'Li, Na', 'Jie, Zhijun', 'Su, Xiao']","['Feng X', 'Zhao C', 'Li L', 'Feng J', 'He W', 'Shi T', 'Li N', 'Jie Z', 'Su X']","[""Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", 'Center of Community-Based Health Research, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Unit of Respiratory Infection and Immunity, Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Unit of Respiratory Infection and Immunity, Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", 'Center of Community-Based Health Research, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", 'Center of Community-Based Health Research, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", 'Center of Community-Based Health Research, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", 'Center of Community-Based Health Research, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Shanghai Fifth People's Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", 'Center of Community-Based Health Research, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Unit of Respiratory Infection and Immunity, Institute Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (CCL21 protein, human)', '0 (Ccr7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL21)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asthma/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL21/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/*immunology', 'Lung/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/*immunology', 'Receptors, CCR7/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Th2 Cells/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Asthma tolerance', '*CCL21-CCR7', '*Invariant natural killer T cells', '*PLZF', '*Respiratory syncytial virus']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/04/16 06:00,['2020/07/27 06:00'],"['2020/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.202048798 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2021 Feb;51(2):414-432. doi: 10.1002/eji.202048798.

To date, powerful and consistent prognostic factors have not been established for T-LBL. In this study, we first evaluated the association of event-free survival (EFS) at 24 months (EFS24) with overall survival (OS) in T-LBL patients. Besides, we sought to identify clinical factors of prognostic importance in this rare entity. Between January 2006 and December 2017, ninety-one patients with newly diagnosed T-LBL were retrospectively analyzed. EFS was defined as the time from diagnosis to relapse or progression, unplanned retreatment, death from any cause, or to the last follow-up. In total, 91 patients with a median age of 24 years were enrolled. At a median follow-up of 40.4 months (range, 1.4 to 163.3 months), the 5-year OS and EFS was 47.9% and 43.2%, respectively. Of all patients, 45 (49.5%) achieved EFS24 and 46 (50.5%) did not. Patients who achieved EFS24 showed a markedly superior outcome, compared with those who failed to achieve EFS24 (5-year OS, 90.5% vs 3%, P < 0.001). Univariate analysis indicated bone marrow involvement, response to induction treatment, and stem cell transplantation (SCT) consolidation to be prognostic factors for EFS and OS. In addition, compared with the patients receiving non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)-like treatment protocols, patients treated with hyper-CVAD showed significantly improved EFS and OS. Such survival advantage in terms of EFS and OS was also observed of BMF-90 regimens over NHL-like therapy, despite that the difference in EFS did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.056). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that achievement of complete remission (CR) after induction therapy and SCT consolidation were independent prognostic indicators for both EFS and OS. We confirm that EFS24 is a strong surrogate endpoint for long-term survival in T-LBL, which is clinically useful for individualized risk reassessment, future clinical trial design, and biomarker discovery validation. Further validation in the context of directed prospective clinical trials is warranted.","['Chen, Haizhu', 'Qin, Yan', 'Yang, Jianliang', 'Liu, Peng', 'Zhang, Changgong', 'He, Xiaohui', 'Zhou,

However, it is also known that viral infections can modify cellular DNA methylation patterns. Therefore, changes in the methylation of cytosine-guanine (CpG) islands might modulate progression of HIV infection. METHODS: In total, 85 samples were analyzed: 21 elite controllers (EC), 21 subjects with HIV before combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) (viremic, 93 325 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [HIV-1] RNA copies/mL) and under suppressive cART (cART, median of 17 months, <50 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL), and 22 HIV-negative donors (HIVneg). We analyzed the methylation pattern of 485 577 CpG in DNA from peripheral CD4+ T lymphocytes. We selected the most differentially methylated gene (TNF) and analyzed its specific methylation, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, and plasma protein levels in 5 individuals before and after initiation of cART. RESULTS: We observed 129 methylated CpG sites (associated with 43 gene promoters) for which statistically significant differences were recorded in viremic versus HIVneg, 162 CpG sites (55 gene promoters) in viremic versus cART, 441 CpG sites (163 gene promoters) in viremic versus EC, but none in EC versus HIVneg. The TNF promoter region was hypermethylated in viremic versus HIVneg, cART, and EC. Moreover, we observed greater plasma levels of TNF in viremic individuals than in EC, cART, and HIVneg. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that genome methylation patterns vary depending on HIV infection status and progression profile and that these variations might have an impact on controlling HIV infection in the absence of cART.","['Moron-Lopez, Sara', 'Urrea, Victor', 'Dalmau, Judith', 'Lopez, Miguel', 'Puertas, Maria C', 'Ouchi, Dan', 'Gomez, Antonio', 'Passaes, Caroline', 'Mothe, Beatriz', 'Brander, Christian', 'Saez-Cirion, Asier', 'Clotet, Bonaventura', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Berdasco, Maria', 'Martinez-Picado, Javier']","['Moron-Lopez S', 'Urrea V', 'Dalmau J', 'Lopez M', 'Puertas MC', 'Ouchi D', 'Gomez A', 'Passaes C', 'Mothe B', 'Brander C', 'Saez-Cirion A', 'Clotet B', 'Esteller M', 'Berdasco M', 'Martinez-Picado J']","['AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.', 'AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.', 'AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Epigenetic Therapies Group, Experimental and Clinical Hematology Program, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.', 'AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut Pasteur, Unite HIV, Inflammation et Persistence, Paris, France.', 'AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.', 'Fundacio Lluita Contra la Sida, University Hospital ""Germans Trias i Pujol,"" Badalona, Spain.', 'University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia (UVic-UCC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.', 'University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia (UVic-UCC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institut Pasteur, Unite HIV, Inflammation et Persistence, Paris, France.', 'AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.', 'Fundacio Lluita Contra la Sida, University Hospital ""Germans Trias i Pujol,"" Badalona, Spain.', 'University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia (UVic-UCC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB), Badalona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Epigenetic Therapies Group, Experimental and Clinical Hematology Program, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'AIDS Research Institute IrsiCaixa, Badalona, Spain.', 'University of Vic-Central University of Catalonia (UVic-UCC), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,,IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Disease Progression', '*HIV Infections/drug therapy', '*HIV-1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Viremia']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HIV-1 disease progression', '*HIV-1 infection', '*TNF', '*genome-wide methylation']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/07/27 06:00'],"['2020/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['5876587 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/ciaa1047 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2021 May 4;72(9):e256-e264. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciaa1047.,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Nevertheless, there is an urgent need for new and safer topoII inhibitors due to the emergence of secondary malignancies and the appearance of resistance mechanisms upon treatment with topoII-targeted anticancer drugs. In the present investigation, we report the discovery of a new topoII inhibitor, whose design was based on the structure of the natural product trypthantrin, a natural alkaloid containing a basic indoloquinazoline moiety. This new topoII inhibitor, here numbered compound 5, is found to inhibit topoII with an IC50 of 26.6 +/- 4.7 muM. Notably, compound 5 is more potent than the template compound trypthantrin, and even than the widely used topoII-targeted clinical drug etoposide. In addition, compound 5 also exhibits high water solubility, and a promising antiproliferative activity on different tumor cell lines such as acute leukemia, colon, and breast cancer. In light of these results, compound 5 represents a promising lead for developing new topoII inhibitors as anti-cancer therapeutic agents.","['Catanzaro, Elena', 'Betari, Nibal', 'Arencibia, Jose M', 'Montanari, Serena', 'Sissi, Claudia', 'De Simone, Angela', 'Vassura, Ivano', 'Santini, Alan', 'Andrisano, Vincenza', 'Tumiatti, Vincenzo', 'De Vivo, Marco', 'Krysko, Dmitri V', 'Rocchi, Marco B L', 'Fimognari, Carmela', 'Milelli, Andrea']","['Catanzaro E', 'Betari N', 'Arencibia JM', 'Montanari S', 'Sissi C', 'De Simone A', 'Vassura I', 'Santini A', 'Andrisano V', 'Tumiatti V', 'De Vivo M', 'Krysko DV', 'Rocchi MBL', 'Fimognari C', 'Milelli A']","[""Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-Universita di Bologna, Corso D'Augusto 237, 47921, Rimini, Italy."", ""Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-Universita di Bologna, Corso D'Augusto 237, 47921, Rimini, Italy."", 'Molecular Modeling and Drug Discovery Lab, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Via Morego 30, 16163, Genova, Italy.', ""Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-Universita di Bologna, Corso D'Augusto 237, 47921, Rimini, Italy."", 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, Via Marzolo, 5, 35131, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Drug Science and Technology, University of Turin, Via Giuria 9, 10125, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Industrial Chemistry ""Toso Montanari"", Alma Mater Studiorum-Universita di Bologna, Viale Del Risorgimento, 4, 40136, Bologna, Italy.', ""Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-Universita di Bologna, Corso D'Augusto 237, 47921, Rimini, Italy."", ""Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-Universita di Bologna, Corso D'Augusto 237, 47921, Rimini, Italy."", ""Department for Life Quality Studies, Alma Mater Studiorum-Universita di Bologna, Corso D'Augusto 237, 47921, Rimini, Italy."", 'Molecular Modeling and Drug Discovery Lab, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Via Morego 30, 16163, Genova, Italy.', 'Cell Death Investigation and Therapy Laboratory, Department of Human Structure and Repair, Ghent University, 9000, Ghent, Belgium; Cancer Research Institute Ghent, 9000, Ghent, Belgium; Department of Pathophysiology, Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (Sechenov University), 119146 Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, Campus Scientifico ""E.

Recent studies have shown that antihistamines can induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) in a variety of cell lines. Furthermore, our previous data indicates that lysosomotropic agents can cause synergistic cell death in vitro when combined with some tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). In the current study, we have shown that three over-the-counter antihistamines, clemastine, desloratadine, and loratadine, preferentially induce cell death via LMP in CLL cells, as compared to normal lymphocytes. We treated primary CLL cells with antihistamines and found clemastine was the most effective at inducing LMP and cell death. More importantly, the antihistamines induced synergistic cytotoxicity when combined with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ibrutinib, but not with chemotherapy. Moreover, the synergy between clemastine and ibrutinib was associated with the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased Mcl-1 expression leading to apoptosis. This study proposes a potential novel treatment strategy for CLL, repurposing FDA-approved allergy medications in combination with the targeted therapy ibrutinib to enhance drug efficacy.","['Chanas-Larue, Aaron', 'Villalpando-Rodriguez, Gloria E', 'Henson, Elizabeth S', 'Johnston, James B', 'Gibson, Spencer B']","['Chanas-Larue A', 'Villalpando-Rodriguez GE', 'Henson ES', 'Johnston JB', 'Gibson SB']","['Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada; Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study performed from September to November 2019 to determine 1) demographic and subgroup characteristics of patients with newly diagnosed cases of acute myeloid leukemia, 2) FDA data on drugs indicated for AML approved from 1969 through November 2019, 3) measures of response from drug labels, and 4) published reports documenting the response for drugs approved before the 1979 Labeling Act. We used publicly available data from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the American Cancer Society, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, and the U.S. Census Bureau. According to our estimation methods, cytarabine infused continuously for 7 days, with three short boluses of anthracycline over Days 1-3, the standard of care known as ""7 + 3"", continues to have the largest population benefit. The maximum cost per course of treatment for an average regimen is enasidenib for salvage therapy, estimated to be around $120,131. The minimum cost was $1,662.50 for standard 7 + 3 chemotherapy. The mean and median cost for all AML treatments was $43,784.26 and $35,083.70, respectively.

STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the CXR findings at diagnosis for 990 patients aged 1-18 years with ALL treated during the Total XV and XVI studies at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and evaluated the associations of these findings with clinical characteristics and initial management. RESULTS: Common findings were peribronchial/perihilar thickening (n = 187 [19.0%]), pulmonary opacity/infiltrate (n = 159 [16.1%]), pleural effusion/thickening (n = 109 [11.1%]), mediastinal mass (n = 107 [10.9%]), and cardiomegaly (n = 68 [6.9%]). Portable CXRs provided results comparable with those obtained with 2-view films. Forty of 107 patients with a mediastinal mass (37.4%) had tracheal deviation/compression. Mediastinal mass, pleural effusion/thickening, and tracheal deviation/compression were more often associated with T-cell ALL than with B-cell ALL (P < .001 for all). Pulmonary opacity/infiltrate was associated with younger age (P = .003) and was more common in T-cell ALL than in B-cell ALL (P = .001). Peribronchial/perihilar thickening was associated with younger age (P < .001) and with positive central nervous system disease (P = .012). Patients with cardiomegaly were younger (P = .031), more often black than white (P = .007), and more often categorized as low risk than standard/high risk (P = .017). Patients with a mediastinal mass, pleural effusion/thickening, tracheal deviation/compression, or pulmonary opacity/infiltrate were more likely to receive less invasive sedation and more intensive care unit admissions and respiratory support (P </= .001 for all). Cardiomegaly was associated with intensive care unit admission (P = .008). No patients died of cardiorespiratory events during the initial 7 days of management. CONCLUSIONS: The CXR can detect various intrathoracic lesions and is helpful in planning initial management.","['Smith, Wesley T', 'Shiao, Kenneth T', 'Varotto, Elena', 'Zhou, Yinmei', 'Iijima, Mayuko', 'Anghelescu, Doralina L', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Kaste, Sue C', 'Inaba, Hiroto']","['Smith WT', 'Shiao KT', 'Varotto E', 'Zhou Y', 'Iijima M', 'Anghelescu DL', 'Cheng C', 'Jeha S', 'Pui CH', 'Kaste SC', 'Inaba H']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN; Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pediatric Medicine, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN; Department of Global Pediatric Medicine, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN; Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; Department of Radiology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN.

Here, we demonstrated practical laboratory tools for monitoring of BCR-ABL1 transcripts in chronic myeloid leukemia patients undergoing TK inhibitor therapy. METHODS: Real time quantitative PCR and direct sequencing were performed for monitoring of BCR-ABL1 transcripts in 245 treated CML. RESULTS: At month 3 after first time point of monitoring, we found that 89% (218/245), 2% (5/245), and 9% (22/245) of patients are determined as optimal, warning, and failure response, respectively. The responses to TKI were slightly decreased at months 6 as following 73% optimal (180/245), 18% warning (43/245), and 9% failure response (22/245). Additionally, responses to TKI were gradually decreased at month 12 after first time point of monitoring as following 65% optimal (160/245), 13% warning (31/245), and 22% failure (54/245). We could detect 20% (49/245) of patients positive for BCR-ABL1 TKD mutations. Interestingly, one third (17 of 49) of TKD mutated cases were positive for compound/polyclonal mutation patterns. While major molecular response were observed in the majority of patients without TKD mutation, resistant to TKI were detected in patients with T315I mutation (n = 9; % mean IS = 8.1510, % median IS = 9.7000), compound/polyclonal mutations with T315I (n = 9; % mean IS = 13.0779, % median IS = 5.404), and other TKD mutations (n = 14; % mean IS = 8.1416, % median IS = 1.060), respectively. Conlusion: These practical laboratory techniques provided a more comprehensive understanding of CML progression during drug therapy and could be of benefit in earlier prognosis.","['Limsuwanachot, Nittaya', 'Kongruang, Adcharee', 'Rerkamnuaychoke, Budsaba', 'Singdong, Roongrudee', 'Niparuck, Pimjai', 'Jootar, Saengsuree', 'Siriboonpiputtana, Teerapong']","['Limsuwanachot N', 'Kongruang A', 'Rerkamnuaychoke B', 'Singdong R', 'Niparuck P', 'Jootar S', 'Siriboonpiputtana T']","['Human Genetic Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Human Genetic Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Human Genetic Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Doctoral Program in Clinical Pathology, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Human Genetic Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Drug Monitoring/*methods/standards', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Laboratories/*standards', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/epidemiology/genetics/*pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thailand/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1 TKD mutations', 'BCR-ABL1 mRNA', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/07/27 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.7.2003 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Jul 1;21(7):2003-2012. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.7.2003.,,20200701,,,,PMC7573403,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefor; this study was designed to determine the prevalence and clinical impact of NOTCH-1 mutations in AML patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the current study, NOTCH-1 gene mutations were identified in Bone Marrow samples obtained from fifty primary AML patients before start of therapy using Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: NOTCH-1 gene mutations were detected in 6 out of 50 AML cases (12%). The three mutations were (two mutations C7318A in the Pest domain exon 34); (another 2 in the Pest domain Del 7,344, ins C7349, G7356A and the last ones in the HD-N exon-26 (Del A4609). The clinical findings in the mutant AML (mu AML) patients did not significantly different as compared to the un mutated (unmut) AML patients. There is significant association between CD7 aberrant expression and NOTCH-1 mutations. The complete remission was significantly higher in unmut AML cases as compared to mut AML ones (P=0.024). Multivariate (Age; Gender; Bone Marrow Blast cells; NOTCH-1 mutations) Cox regression analysis revealed that NOTCH-1 mutation is an independent risk factor for AML overall survival (P<0.001). The OS in unmut AML group (21.2 months) was significantly longer as compared to mut AML one (1.2 months) (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that NOTCH-1 gene mutations were detected in 12% of AML patients. These mutations displayed bad clinical outcome on AML patients. Therapeutic targeting of NOTCH-1 could be a potentially effective approach to combat master oncogenic drivers in AML.","['Aref, Salah', 'Rizk, Rasha', 'El Agder, Mohamed', 'Fakhry, Wafaa', 'El Zafarany, Maha', 'Sabry, Mohamed']","['Aref S', 'Rizk R', 'El Agder M', 'Fakhry W', 'El Zafarany M', 'Sabry M']","['Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Medical Oncology Unit, Mansoura University Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Egypt.', 'Hematology Unit, Clinical Pathology Department, Mansoura University Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'NOTCH1', 'Overall survival', 'mutations']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/07/27 06:00'],"['2020/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.7.1987 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Jul 1;21(7):1987-1992. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.7.1987.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4822-5204'],20200701,,,,PMC7573420,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An impaired metabolism of these compounds related to genetic polymorphism may cause cancer such as acute myeloid leukemia AML. OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the relationship between C1236T polymorphism and the risk of AML development in a sample of Moroccan population. METHODS: The present case-control study included 131 AML patients and 136 healthy controls. The MDR1 C1236T polymorphism was identified by PCR-RFLP method. Meta-analysis was performed to discuss our results. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, MetaGenyo and MedCalc. RESULTS: A positive association was found between the 1236TT mutant genotype and the risk of AML (OR 2.39; 95% CI 1.02-5.57, p= 0.04) compared to the wild type 1236CC. In addition, the recessive model revealed that carriers of 1236TT mutant genotype were more exposed to develop AML when compared to the combined 1236CC/CT genotype (OR: 2.27, CI: 1.01-5.05, p=0.04). The clinical parameters of AML showed no significant association. Meta-analysis demonstrated no statistically significant association between this polymorphism and AML susceptibility. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the MDR1C1236T polymorphism appears to be associated with the risk of AML. Further studies, including a large sample size, are needed to confirm these findings.","['Ait Boujmia, Oum Kaltoum', 'Nadifi, Sellama', 'Dehbi, Hind', 'Lamchahab, Mouna', 'Quessar, Asma']","['Ait Boujmia OK', 'Nadifi S', 'Dehbi H', 'Lamchahab M', 'Quessar A']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Casablanca, University Hassan II, Casablanca, Moroccoa.', 'Morocco Laboratory of medical Genetics, CHU Ibn Rochd, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Casablanca, University Hassan II, Casablanca, Moroccoa.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of Casablanca, University Hassan II, Casablanca, Moroccoa.', 'Morocco Laboratory of medical Genetics, CHU Ibn Rochd, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Ibn Rochd University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Department of Onco-Hematology, Ibn Rochd University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morocco/epidemiology', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['MDR1', 'Meta-analysis', 'P-gp', 'Single nucleotide polymorphism', 'acute myeloid leukemia']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/07/27 06:00'],"['2019/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.7.1899 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Jul 1;21(7):1899-1904. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.7.1899.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1014-9728'],20200701,,,,PMC7573417,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We prospectively examined residential proximity to crops and animals during pregnancy and risk of childhood leukemia and central nervous system (CNS) tumors in Denmark. METHODS: The Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) consists of 91,769 pregnant women (96,841 live-born children) enrolled in 1996-2003. For 61 childhood leukemias and 59 CNS tumors <15 years of age that were diagnosed through 2014 and a ~10% random sample of the live births (N = 9394) with geocoded addresses, we linked pregnancy addresses to crop fields and animal farm locations and estimated the crop area (hectares [ha]) and number of animals (standardized by their nitrogen emissions) by type within 250 meters (m), 500 m, 1000 m, and 2000 m of the home. We also estimated pesticide applications (grams, active ingredient) based on annual sales data for nine herbicides and one fungicide that were estimated to have been applied to >30% of the area of one or more crop. We used Cox proportional hazard models (weighted to the full cohort) to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of childhood leukemia and CNS tumors with crop area, animals, and pesticide applications adjusted for gender and maternal age. RESULTS: Sixty-three percent of mothers had crops within 500 m of their homes during pregnancy; winter and spring cereals were the major crop types. Compared to mothers with no crops <500 m, we found increasing risk of childhood leukemia among offspring of mothers with increasing crop area near their home (highest tertile >24 ha HR: 2.0, CI:1.02-3.8), which was stronger after adjustment for animals (within 1000 m) (HR: 2.6, CI:1.02-6.8). We also observed increased risk for grass/clover (highest tertile >1.1 ha HR: 3.1, CI:1.2-7.7), peas (>0 HR: 2.4, CI: 1.02-5.4), and maize (>0 HR: 2.8, CI: 1.1-6.9) in animal-adjusted models. We found no association between number of animals near homes and leukemia risk. Crops, total number of animals, and hogs within 500 m of the home were not associated with CNS tumors but we observed an increased risk with >median cattle compared with no animals in crop-adjusted models (HR = 2.2, CI: 1.02-4.9). In models adjusted for total animals, the highest tertiles of use of three herbicides and one fungicide were associated with elevated risk of leukemia but no associations were statistically significant; there were no associations with CNS tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of childhood leukemia was associated with higher crop area near mothers' homes during pregnancy; CNS tumors were associated with higher cattle density. Quantitative estimates of crop pesticides and other agricultural exposures are needed to clarify possible reasons for these increased risks.","['Patel, Deven M', 'Gyldenkaerne, Steen', 'Jones, Rena R', 'Olsen, Sjurdur F', 'Tikellis, Gabriella', 'Granstrom, Charlotta', 'Dwyer, Terence', 'Stayner, Leslie T', 'Ward, Mary H']","['Patel DM', 'Gyldenkaerne S', 'Jones RR', 'Olsen SF', 'Tikellis G', 'Granstrom C', 'Dwyer T', 'Stayner LT', 'Ward MH']","['Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 9609 Medical Center Dr., Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'Aarhus University, Department of Environmental Science, Frederiksborgvej 399, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 9609 Medical Center Dr., Rockville, MD 20850, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Center for Fetal Programming, Staten Serum Institute, Artillerivej 5, 2300 Kobenhavn, Denmark.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Center for Fetal Programming, Staten Serum Institute, Artillerivej 5, 2300 Kobenhavn, Denmark.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Illinois at Chicago, 1603 West Taylor Street, Room 978a, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.', 'Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 9609 Medical Center Dr., Rockville, MD 20850, USA.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), imatinib and its derivatives, have achieved great progress in the treatment of CML. However, many CML patients do not respond to TKIs alone. p19(INK4d), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, plays important roles in proliferation, DNA damage repair, apoptosis and cell differentiation, but its role in CML is unknown. Herein, we found that the expression of p19(INK4d) in CML patients was significantly lower than that in healthy controls. p19(INK4d) overexpression inhibits cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, and cooperates with imatinib to inhibit CML more effectively in vitro and in vivo.

While the major route of virus transmission is believed to be iatrogenic, BLV proviral DNA has been identified in biological materials, including nasal secretions, saliva, milk, colostrum, and semen, and in several insect species, including horses flies. However, insects' role in the natural transmission of BLV has not been clearly demonstrated. This study assessed the possible role of midges - Culicoides spp. - in BLV transmission. BLVs were genetically characterized and BLV infection seroprevelance was determined in 224 cattle sampled from 27 different small family herds in five different districts in Hatay province, southern Turkey. Out of the 25 Culicoides spp. pools, one (4.0%; 1/25) was a C.schultzei pool while 2.67% (6/224) of the sampled cattle were positive for BLV nucleic acid. The seroprevalance rates for the sampled herds and all sampled cattle were 7.40% (2/27) and 1.33% (3/224), respectively. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the sequences of the BLVs from the cattle (n = 6) and the one BLV-positive C.schultzei pool clustered on genotype 1 (G1) BLVs. Although these results do not reveal the exact role of Culicoides spp. or other midges flies in BLV transmission, the simultaneous presence of same substitions in BLVs from both cattle and a C.schultzei pool is noteworthy. Further studies on the env gene and other BLV gene regions detected from cattle and C.schultzei pools are ongoing to understand the possible epidemiological relationship between cattle and flies.","['Dogan, Firat', 'Bilge Dagalp, Seval', 'Dik, Bilal', 'Farzani, Touraj Aligholipour', 'Alkan, Feray']","['Dogan F', 'Bilge Dagalp S', 'Dik B', 'Farzani TA', 'Alkan F']","['Hatay Mustafa Kemal University, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Virology, Hatay, Turkey.', 'Ankara University, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Virology, Ankara, Turkey.

Although effectiveness of levofloxacin antibacterial prophylaxis in oncology patients is recognized, its cost-effectiveness is unknown. This study evaluated epidemiologic data regarding levofloxacin use and the cost-effectiveness of this strategy as the cost per bacteremia episode, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death avoided in children with AML. PROCEDURE: A retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database compared demographic and clinical characteristics and receipt of levofloxacin prophylaxis in children with AML admitted for chemotherapy from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2018. We then developed a decision analysis model in this population that compared costs associated with bacteremia, ICU admission, or death secondary to bacteremia to levofloxacin prophylaxis cost from a healthcare perspective. Time horizon is one chemotherapy cycle. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses evaluated model uncertainty. RESULTS: Prophylaxis cost $8491 per bacteremia episode prevented compared with an average added hospital cost of $119 478. Prophylaxis cost $81 609 per ICU admission avoided, compared with an average added hospital cost of $94 181. Prophylaxis cost $220 457 per death avoided. In sensitivity analysis, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per bacteremia episode avoided, prophylaxis remained cost-effective in 94.6% of simulations. Prophylaxis use was more common in recent years in patients with relapsed disease and with chemotherapy regimens considered more intensive. CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis is cost-effective in preventing bacterial infections in patients with AML. Findings support increased use in patients considered at high risk of bacterial infection secondary to myelosuppression.","['McCormick, Meghan', 'Friehling, Erika', 'Kalpatthi, Ramasubramanian', 'Siripong, Nalyn', 'Smith, Kenneth']","['McCormick M', 'Friehling E', 'Kalpatthi R', 'Siripong N', 'Smith K']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."", 'The Clinical and Translational Science Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6GNT3Y5LMF (Levofloxacin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/*economics/methods', 'Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/*economics/pathology', 'Child', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*economics/pathology', 'Levofloxacin/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*child', '*infection', '*levofloxacin', '*prophylaxis']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28469 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Oct;67(10):e28469. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28469.

Current therapies ultimately aim to activate the mitochondria-controlled (intrinsic) apoptosis pathway, but complex alterations in intracellular signaling cascades and the extracellular microenvironment hamper treatment response. On the one hand, proteins of the BCL-2 family set the threshold for cell death induction and prevent accidental cellular suicide. On the other hand, controlling a cell's readiness to die also determines whether malignant cells are sensitive or resistant to anticancer treatments. Here, we show that HNSCC cells upregulate the proapoptotic BH3-only protein NOXA in response to hyperosmotic stress. Induction of NOXA is sufficient to counteract the antiapoptotic properties of MCL-1 and switches HNSCC cells from dual BCL-XL/MCL-1 protection to exclusive BCL-XL addiction. Hypertonicity-induced functional loss of MCL-1 renders BCL-XL a synthetically lethal target in HNSCC, and inhibition of BCL-XL efficiently kills HNSCC cells that poorly respond to conventional therapies. We identify hypertonicity-induced upregulation of NOXA as link between osmotic pressure in the tumor environment and mitochondrial priming, which could perspectively be exploited to boost efficacy of anticancer drugs.","['Heimer, Sina', 'Knoll, Gertrud', 'Neubert, Patrick', 'Hammer, Karin P', 'Wagner, Stefan', 'Bauer, Richard J', 'Jantsch, Jonathan', 'Ehrenschwender, Martin']","['Heimer S', 'Knoll G', 'Neubert P', 'Hammer KP', 'Wagner S', 'Bauer RJ', 'Jantsch J', 'Ehrenschwender M']","['Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Center for Medical Biotechnology, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (S63845)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Osmotic Pressure/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCL-XL', '*MCL-1', '*NOXA', '*head and neck cancer', '*hyperosmotic stress']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/07/28 06:00,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/febs.15492 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2021 Mar;288(6):1822-1838. doi: 10.1111/febs.15492.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) exhibits somatic activating mutations in 30%-40% of LGL leukemia cases. Transcriptional targets of STAT3 include inflammatory cytokines, thus previous studies have measured cytokine levels of LGL leukemia patients compared to normal donors. Sphingolipid metabolism is a growing area of cancer research, with efforts focused on drug discovery. To date, no studies have examined serum sphingolipids in LGL leukemia patients, and only one study compared a subset of cytokines between the T-LGL and NK-LGL subtypes. Therefore, here, we included both LGL leukemia subtypes with the goals of (a) measuring serum sphingolipids for the first time, (b) measuring cytokines to find distinctions between the subtypes, and (c) establishing relationships with STAT3 mutations and clinical data. The serum analyses identified cytokines (EGF, IP-10, G-CSF) and sphingolipids (SMC22, SMC24, SMC20, LysoSM) significantly different in the LGL leukemia group compared to normal donors. In a mixed STAT3 mutation group, D661Y samples exhibited the highest mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values. We explored this further by expanding the cohort to include larger groups of single STAT3 mutations. Male D661Y STAT3 samples had lower Hgb and higher MCV compared to wild type (WT) or Y640F counterparts. This is the first report examining large groups of individual STAT3 mutations. Overall, our results revealed novel serum biomarkers and evidence that D661Y mutation may show different clinical manifestation compared to WT or Y640F STAT3.","['Olson, Kristine C', 'Moosic, Katharine B', 'Jones, Marieke K', 'Larkin, Paige M K', 'Olson, Thomas L', 'Toro, Mariella F', 'Fox, Todd E', 'Feith, David J', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Olson KC', 'Moosic KB', 'Jones MK', 'Larkin PMK', 'Olson TL', 'Toro MF', 'Fox TE', 'Feith DJ', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Health Sciences Library, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Sphingolipids)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*blood/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Registries', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Sphingolipids/*blood', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*hexosylceramides', '*macrocytic anemia', '*neutropenia', '*sphingomyelins']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/07/21 06:00,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3246 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2020 Sep;9(18):6533-6549. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3246.

METHODS: We analysed 39 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and haematological malignancies. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared to a matched control group of 53 non-cancer patients with COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the risk factors associated with poor outcome. RESULTS: The most frequent haematological diseases were lymphoma (30%) and multiple myeloma (30%). Eighty-seven % HP developed moderate or severe disease. Patients with haematological malignancies had a significantly higher mortality rate compared to non-cancer patients (35.9% vs 13.2%; P = .003 (odds ratio 6.652). The worst outcome was observed in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients. Only age >70 years and C reactive protein >10 mg/dl at admission were associated with higher risk of death (odds ratio 34.86, P = .003 and 13.56,P = .03). Persistent viral sheddind was detected in 5 HP. Active chemotherapy, viral load at diagnosis and COVID-19 therapy were not predictors of outcome. CONCLUSION: Mortality of COVID-19 is significantly higher in patients with haematological malignancies compared to non-cancer patients. The impact of persistent viral shedding must be considered in order to re-start therapies and maintain infectious control measures.","['Sanchez-Pina, Jose Maria', 'Rodriguez Rodriguez, Mario', 'Castro

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Primary objective was to evaluate the OS impact of BEACOPP using individual patient data. Secondary objectives were progression-free survival (PFS), secondary cancers, and use of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). RESULTS: About 1227 patients were included. The 7-year OS was 84.3% (95% CI 80.8-87.2) for ABVD vs 87.7% (95% CI 84.5-90.2) for BEACOPP. Two follow-up periods were identified based on survival curves and hazard ratio (HR) over time. For the first 18 months, there was no difference. For the second period of >/=18 months, ABVD patients had a higher death risk (HRABVD vs BEACOPP = 1.59; 95% CI 1.09-2.33). A Cox model stratified by trial and evaluating the effect of treatment and International Prognostic Index (IPI) score as fixed effects showed that both were statistically significant (treatment, P = .0185; IPI score, P = .0107). The 7-year PFS was 71.1% (95% CI 67.1-74.6) for ABVD vs 81.1% (95% CI 77.5-84.2) for BEACOPP (P < .001). After ABVD, 25 secondary cancers (4.0%) were reported with no myelodysplasia (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared to 36 (6.5%) after BEACOPP, which included 13 patients with MDS/AML. Following ABVD, 86 patients (13.8%) received ASCT vs 39 (6.4%) for BEACOPP. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis showed a slight improvement in OS for BEACOPP and confirmed a PFS benefit. Frontline use of BEACOPP instead of ABVD increased secondary leukemia incidence but halved the requirement for ASCT.","['Andre, Marc P E', 'Carde, Patrice', 'Viviani, Simonetta', 'Bellei, Monica', 'Fortpied, Catherine', 'Hutchings, Martin', 'Gianni, Alessandro M', 'Brice, Pauline', 'Casasnovas, Olivier', 'Gobbi, Paolo G', 'Zinzani, Pier Luigi', 'Dupuis, Jehan', 'Iannitto, Emilio', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Briere, Josette', 'Clement-Filliatre, Laurianne', 'Heczko, Marian', 'Valagussa, Pinuccia', 'Douxfils, Jonathan', 'Depaus, Julien', 'Federico, Massimo', 'Mounier, Nicolas']","['Andre MPE', 'Carde P', 'Viviani S', 'Bellei M', 'Fortpied C', 'Hutchings M', 'Gianni AM', 'Brice P', 'Casasnovas O', 'Gobbi PG', 'Zinzani PL', 'Dupuis J', 'Iannitto E', 'Rambaldi A', 'Briere J', 'Clement-Filliatre L', 'Heczko M', 'Valagussa P', 'Douxfils J', 'Depaus J', 'Federico M', 'Mounier N']","['Hematology Department, CHU UCL Namur, Yvoir, Belgium.', 'Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, IEO European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', ""Fondazione Italiana Limfomi, Dipartimento di Scienze Medische e Chirurgiche Materno-Infantili e dell'Adulto, University of Modena, e Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy."", 'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, IEO European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'APHP Hopital Saint-louis, Hemato-oncologie, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Hematology department and INSERM1231, Hopital F.

Concerns regarding neurotoxicity limit the use of these agents. No studies have evaluated the association between fluoroquinolone use and neurotoxicity in pediatric oncology patients receiving other neurotoxic agents such as vincristine. METHODS: An observational cohort study comprising patients aged 0-18 at diagnosis enrolled on a prospective study for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at a pediatric comprehensive cancer center between October 2007 and November 2018. Data for neuropathic pain and sensory or motor neuropathy were collected prospectively, and a Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate associations between administration of fluoroquinolone antibiotics during induction therapy and subsequent development of vincristine-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (VIPN). RESULTS: A total of 598 participants were enrolled, including 338 (57%) who received fluoroquinolones during induction therapy; of these 470 (79%) were diagnosed with VIPN and 139 (23%) were diagnosed with high-grade (Grade 3+) VIPN. On unadjusted analyses, and analyses adjusted for age and race, there was no evidence of an association between fluoroquinolone exposure and subsequent VIPN (hazard ratio [HR] 0.8, 95% CI 0.5-1.04, P = .08) or high-grade VIPN (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.4-2.2, P = .87). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this observational study do not show an association between exposure to fluoroquinolone antibiotics during induction therapy for ALL and subsequent development of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathies, and suggest that a large increase in VIPN is unlikely.","['Karol, Seth E', 'Sun, Yilun', 'Tang, Li', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Ferrolino, Jose', 'Allison, Kim J', 'Cross, Shane J', 'Evans, William E', 'Crews, Kristine R', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Wolf, Joshua']","['Karol SE', 'Sun Y', 'Tang L', 'Pui CH', 'Ferrolino J', 'Allison KJ', 'Cross SJ', 'Evans WE', 'Crews KR', 'Jeha S', 'Wolf J']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.', ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.', ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Fluoroquinolones)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fluoroquinolones/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Motor Neurons/drug effects', 'Neuralgia/chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/diagnosis/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensory Receptor Cells/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*antibiotic', '*child', '*ciprofloxacin', '*leukemia', '*levofloxacin', '*lymphoid', '*polyneuropathy', '*prophylaxis']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/07/21 06:00,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3249 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2020 Sep;9(18):6550-6555. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3249.

Thus, identifying gastromalacia and differentiating it from other causes of gastric perforation is essential to avoid misdiagnosis. Herein, three cases of gastromalacia are described.

Although common treatment protocols have improved overall survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), they continue to relapse and progress. In the present in vitro study, the application of anti-PD-1 and anti-TIM-3 blocking antibodies was studied to restore the function of exhausted CD8(+) T cells in CLL. CD8(+) T cells were isolated from peripheral blood of 20 patients with CLL, treated with blocking antibodies, and cocultured with mitomycin-frozen non-CD8(+) T cell fraction as target cells. Cultures were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies to assess the proliferation of CD8(+) T cells by MTT and stimulated with PMA/ionomycin to measure the levels of CD107a expression and cytokine production by flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively. Our results showed that the blockade of PD-1 and TIM-3 does not improve the proliferation of CD8(+) T cells in CLL patients. No significant difference was found between control and blocked groups in terms of degranulation properties and production of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, and IL-10 by CD8(+) T cells. We observed that pre-treatment of CD8(+) T cells with blocking antibodies in CLL patients at early clinical stages had no effects on restoring their functional properties. Further in vitro and in vivo complementary studies are required to more explore the utility of checkpoint inhibitors for CLL patients.","['Rezazadeh, Hadiseh', 'Astaneh, Mojgan', 'Tehrani, Mohsen', 'Hossein-Nataj, Hadi', 'Zaboli, Ehsan', 'Shekarriz, Ramin', 'Asgarian-Omran, Hossein']","['Rezazadeh H', 'Astaneh M', 'Tehrani M', 'Hossein-Nataj H', 'Zaboli E', 'Shekarriz R', 'Asgarian-Omran H']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, Non-Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, Non-Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Imam Khomeini Hospital, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, Non-Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Imam Khomeini Hospital, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran. asgarianhossein@yahoo.com.', 'Gastrointestinal Cancer Research Center, Non-Communicable Diseases Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran. asgarianhossein@yahoo.com.', 'Immunogenetics Research Center, School of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran. asgarianhossein@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunol Res,Immunologic research,8611087,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HAVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)', '0 (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', 'H18SKU3289 (visilizumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Anti-PD-1', '*Anti-TIM-3', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Immune checkpoints', '*Immunotherapy']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/08/24 06:00,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12026-020-09146-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12026-020-09146-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Immunol Res. 2020 Oct;68(5):269-279. doi: 10.1007/s12026-020-09146-4.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3816-8792'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) are a major effector of antitumour responses to therapeutic antibodies and we have previously reported that resistance to therapeutic antibodies, by MDMs, increases as CLL disease progresses. In this study, we examine the effect of a Class IIa-selective HDAC inhibitor (TMP195) on the phagocytic response to opsonised tumor cells or non-opsonised targets by MDMs derived from CLL patients. We report that TMP195 enhances phagocytic responses to antibody-opsonised CLL cells and E. coli within 30 min of treatment. The enhanced response is phenocopied by knockdown of the Class IIa HDAC, HDAC7, or by low concentrations of the pan-HDAC inhibitor, vorinostat. HDAC7 knockdown and inhibition induces hyperacetylation and hyperphosphorylation of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Moreover, BTK inhibitors abrogated the enhanced response to HDAC7 inhibition. Our data show that HDAC7 is an actionable driver of resistance to therapeutic antibodies by MDMs derived from CLL patients.","['Burgess, M', 'Chen, Y C E', 'Mapp, S', 'Blumenthal, A', 'Mollee, P', 'Gill, D', 'Saunders, N A']","['Burgess M', 'Chen YCE', 'Mapp S', 'Blumenthal A', 'Mollee P', 'Gill D', 'Saunders NA']","['University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Services Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Services Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Translational Research Institute, University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Services Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Cancer Services Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia.', 'University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia. nsaunders@uq.edu.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Macrophages/*metabolism']",,,2020/07/28 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-020-01394-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-020-01394-w [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2020 Aug;39(35):5756-5767. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-01394-w.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the combination of ERK1/2 inhibitor AZD0364 and PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) REH, MOLT-4, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) MOLM-14, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) K562 cell lines. To evaluate the interactions of the drugs, cells were treated for 48 h with AZD0364 or ZSTK474 alone and in combination at fixed ratios. The combinatorial effects of both inhibitors were synergistic over a wide range of concentrations in REH, MOLT-4, and MOLM-14 cell lines. However, in K562 cells, the effects were found to be antagonistic. Furthermore, AZD0364 and ZSTK474 significantly decreased both ERK1/2 and AKT activation in REH, MOLT-4, and MOLM-14 cells. The results showed that incubation with both AZD0364 and ZSTK474 inhibited cell viability, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and induced apoptosis in leukemia cells. We observed that combined treatment with AZD0364 and ZSTK474 affected nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and antioxidant protein levels: NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), thioredoxin (Trx), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and the reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio. These effects were accompanied with decreased antiapoptotic survivin protein level. However, distinct cell line dependent effects were observed. In conclusion, the combination of AZD0364 and ZSTK474 can exert a synergistic anticancer effect in ALL and AML cells, which is associated with the induction of oxidative stress and the involvement of cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms.","['Jasek-Gajda, Ewa', 'Jurkowska, Halina', 'Jasinska, Malgorzata', 'Lis, Grzegorz J']","['Jasek-Gajda E', 'Jurkowska H', 'Jasinska M', 'Lis GJ']","['Department of Histology, Faculty of Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 31034 Krakow, Poland.', 'Chair of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 31034 Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Histology, Faculty of Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 31034 Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Histology, Faculty of Medicine, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 31034 Krakow, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Antioxidants (Basel),"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",101668981,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ERK', 'NRF2', 'PI3K', 'apoptosis', 'glutathione', 'leukemia', 'reactive oxygen species', 'thioredoxin']",2020/07/28 06:00,2020/07/28 06:01,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['antiox9070633 [pii]', '10.3390/antiox9070633 [doi]']",epublish,Antioxidants (Basel). 2020 Jul 17;9(7). pii: antiox9070633. doi: 10.3390/antiox9070633.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2030-0356', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0984-220X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8102-6039', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0467-8519']",20200717,,,"['N41/DBS/000063/Wydzial Lekarski, Uniwersytet Jagiellonski Collegium Medicum']",PMC7402140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Occupational exposure to pesticides (four insecticides, four herbicides and two fungicides) was evaluated using a job-exposure matrix for the Spanish population (MatEmESp) among 302 CLL cases and 1567 population controls in five regions of Spain, 2010-2013. Cumulative exposure scores (CES) were obtained by summing across the exposed jobs the product of prevalence, intensity and duration of exposure to each active substance. Principal components analysis (PCA) and logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, region, education and occupational exposure to solvents were used. Around 20% of controls and 29% of cases were exposed to one or more pesticides. Compared to non-exposed, subjects in the highest tertile (3rd tertile) of CES of insecticides, herbicides, fungicides were more likely to have CLL [OR (95% CI), P-trend; 2.10 (1.38; 3.19), 0.002; 1.77 (1.12; 2.80), 0.12; and 1.67 (1.06; 2.64), 0.10, respectively). Following PCA, the first component (PC1, explaining 70% of the variation) equally led by seven active substances (the insecticide pyrethrin, all herbicides, all fungicides) was associated with a 26% higher odds of having CLL for 1-standard deviation increase in PC1 (95% CI: 1.14 to 1.40). These results confirm previous associations between CLL and exposure to pesticides and provide additional evidence by application groups and active substance. However, more research is needed to disentangle independent effects of individual active substances.","['Benavente, Yolanda', 'Costas, Laura', 'Rodriguez-Suarez, Marta Maria', 'Alguacil, Juan',

However, there is a paucity of data regarding the clinical course and the therapeutic management of patients with chronic kidney disease and COVID-19 infection. To date, most evidence has come from renal transplantation, with about 45 patients reported thus far, and the current data from the ERA-EDTA (ERACODA) registry for transplanted patients and patients on Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT); as for those with glomerular diseases, data are lacking. Herein, we report the case of a 62-year-old patient with severe membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis who had been receiving a high burden of immunosuppression until four months before the COVID-19 infection. He developed severe disease with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. After treatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, despite his low chances, he gradually recovered and survived. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few reported patients with glomerulonephritis who had COVID-19 Besides our single case with glomerulonephritis early during the disease outbreak, the very low prevalence of COVID-19 infection in the country's transplant recipients (0.038%) and dialysis patients (0.24%) reflects the impact of the rapid implementation of social distancing rules as well as of preventive measures for disease control in the hospitals and dialysis units in our country.","['Marinaki, Smaragdi', 'Tsiakas, Stathis', 'Skalioti, Chrysanthi', 'Lourida, Panayiota', 'Argyraki, Aikaterini', 'Grigorakos, Konstantinos', 'Boletis, Ioannis']","['Marinaki S', 'Tsiakas S', 'Skalioti C', 'Lourida P', 'Argyraki A', 'Grigorakos K', 'Boletis I']","['Clinic of Nephrology and Renal Transplantation, Medical School, Laiko Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11527 Athens, Greece.', 'Clinic of Nephrology and Renal Transplantation, Medical School, Laiko Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11527 Athens, Greece.', 'Clinic of Nephrology and Renal Transplantation, Medical School, Laiko Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11527 Athens, Greece.', 'Infectious Diseases Clinic A, Sotiria Chest Diseases Hospital, 11527 Athens, Greece.', 'Infectious Diseases Clinic A, Sotiria Chest Diseases Hospital, 11527 Athens, Greece.', 'Independent Researcher, 12 Protopappa Avenue, 16345 Athens, Greece.', 'Clinic of Nephrology and Renal Transplantation, Medical School, Laiko Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 11527 Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],Switzerland,Medicina (Kaunas),"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",9425208,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4QWG6N8QKH (Hydroxychloroquine)', '75J73V1629 (Ceftriaxone)', '83905-01-5 (Azithromycin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Azithromycin/therapeutic use', 'Betacoronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'Ceftriaxone/therapeutic use', 'Coronavirus Infections/*complications/diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Creatinine/metabolism', 'Cryoglobulinemia/*complications/immunology', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Glomerulonephritis, Membranoproliferative/*complications/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Greece', 'Humans', 'Hydroxychloroquine/therapeutic use', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/therapy', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/immunology', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Pandemics', 'Pneumonia, Viral/*complications/diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/*etiology/therapy', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)', 'glomerulonephritis', 'immunosuppression', 'pneumonia', 'transplantation']",2020/07/28 06:00,2020/08/01 06:00,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['medicina56070355 [pii]', '10.3390/medicina56070355 [doi]']",epublish,Medicina (Kaunas). 2020 Jul 17;56(7). pii: medicina56070355. doi: 10.3390/medicina56070355.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9095-7724'],20200717,,,,PMC7404464,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polygenic and polymorphic Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR) and HLA genes participate in the structural and functional formation of the NK cell repertoire. In this study, we extensively investigated the anti-leukemic potential of NK cell subsets, taking into account these genetic parameters and cytomegalovirus (CMV) status. Hierarchical clustering analysis of NK cell subsets based on NKG2A, KIR, CD57 and NKG2C markers from 68 blood donors identified donor clusters characterized by a specific phenotypic NK cell repertoire linked to a particular immunogenetic KIR and HLA profile and CMV status. On the functional side, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was better recognized by NK cells than acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, a broad inter-individual disparity of NK cell responses exists against the same leukemic target, highlighting bad and good NK responders.

However, treatment-free remission has been achieved in a minority of patients due to evolving TKI resistance and intolerance. Primary or acquired resistance to the approved TKIs and progression to blast crisis (BC), thus, remain a major clinical challenge that requires alternative therapeutic strategies. Here, we first demonstrate that donor natural killer (NK) cells prepared using a protocol adopted in clinical trials can efficiently eliminate CML-BC blasts, with TKI resistance regardless of BCR-ABL1 mutations, and preferentially target CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemic stem cells (LSC), a potential source of disease relapse. Mechanistically, the predominant expression of PVR, a ligand for the NK cell-activating DNAM-1 receptor, in concert with ICAM-1, a ligand for NK cell adhesion, confer this susceptibility to NK cells, despite the lack of ligands for NKG2D, a principal NK cell activating receptor, as an immune evasion mechanism. With these mechanistic insights, our findings provide a proof-of-concept that donor NK cell-based therapy is a viable strategy for overcoming TKI resistance in CML, particularly the advanced, multi-TKI-resistant CML with dismal outcome.","['Kim, Nayoung', 'Kim, Mi-Yeon', 'Cho, Young-Uk', 'Chen, WenYong', 'Lee, Kyoo-Hyung', 'Kim, Hun Sik']","['Kim N', 'Kim MY', 'Cho YU', 'Chen W', 'Lee KH', 'Kim HS']","['Department of Convergence Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul 05505, Korea.', 'Asan Institute for Life Sciences, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, Seoul 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, Seoul 05505, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul 05505, Korea.', 'Microbiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul 05505, Korea.', 'Stem Cell Immunomodulation Research Center (SCIRC), Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul 05505, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['blast crisis', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'leukemic stem cells', 'natural killer cells']",2020/07/28 06:00,2020/07/28 06:01,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12071923 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12071923 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jul 16;12(7). pii: cancers12071923. doi: 10.3390/cancers12071923.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5729-6581'],20200716,,,"['2019R1A2C2006475/National Research Foundation of Korea', '2018R1A5A2020732/National Research Foundation of Korea']",PMC7409178,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Determination of drug treatment patterns can improve our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, enabling drug repurposing. A drug can be associated with a multilayer tissue-specific protein-protein interaction (TSPPI) network for the diseases it is used to treat. Proteins usually interact with other proteins to achieve functions that cause diseases. Hence, studying drug treatment patterns is similar to studying common module structures in multilayer TSPPI networks. Therefore, we propose a network-based model to study the treatment patterns of drugs. The method was designated SDTP (studying drug treatment pattern) and was based on drug effects and a multilayer network model. To demonstrate the application of the SDTP method, we focused on analysis of trichostatin A (TSA) in leukemia, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. We constructed a TSPPI multilayer network and obtained candidate drug-target modules from the network. Gene ontology analysis provided insights into the significance of the drug-target modules and co-expression networks. Finally, two modules were obtained as potential treatment patterns for TSA. Through analysis of the significance, composition, and functions of the selected drug-target modules, we validated the feasibility and rationality of our proposed SDTP method for identifying drug treatment patterns. In summary, our novel approach used a multilayer network model to overcome the shortcomings of single-layer networks and combined the network with information on drug activity. Based on the discovered drug treatment patterns, we can predict the potential diseases that the drug can treat. That is, if a disease-related protein module has a similar structure, then the drug is likely to be a potential drug for the treatment of the disease.","['Yu, Liang', 'Shi, Yayong', 'Zou, Quan', 'Wang, Shuhang', 'Zheng, Liping', 'Gao, Lin']","['Yu L', 'Shi Y', 'Zou Q', 'Wang S', 'Zheng L', 'Gao L']","[""School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an 710071, China."", ""School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an 710071, China."", 'Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu 650004, China.', 'Department of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.', 'School of Computer Science and Technology, Liaocheng University, Liaocheng 252000, China.', ""School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an 710071, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Repositioning', 'Female', 'Gene Ontology', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Maps/*drug effects', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Transcriptome/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['drug action', 'drug treatment pattern', 'drug-target module', 'multilayer network', 'tissue specificity']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/02/23 06:00,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21145014 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21145014 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jul 16;21(14). pii: ijms21145014. doi: 10.3390/ijms21145014.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6406-1142'],20200716,,,"['2018YFC0910403/National Key Research and Development Program of China', '61672406 and 61532014/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",PMC7404256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NOTCH1 plays an important role both in T-cell development and leukemia progression, and more than 60% of human T-ALLs harbor mutations in components of the NOTCH1 signaling pathway, leading to deregulated cell growth and contributing to cell transformation. Besides multiple NOTCH1 target genes, microRNAs have also been shown to regulate T-ALL initiation and progression. Using an established mouse model of T-ALL induced by NOTCH1 activation, we identified several microRNAs downstream of NOTCH1 activation. In particular, we found that NOTCH1 inhibition can induce miR-22-3p in NOTCH1-dependent tumors and that this regulation is also conserved in human samples. Importantly, miR-22-3p overexpression in T-ALL cells can inhibit colony formation in vitro and leukemia progression in vivo. In addition, miR-22-3p was found to be downregulated in T-ALL specimens, both T-ALL cell lines and primary samples, relative to immature T-cells. Our results suggest that miR-22-3p is a functionally relevant microRNA in T-ALL whose modulation can be exploited for therapeutic purposes to inhibit T-ALL progression.","['Saccomani, Valentina', 'Grassi, Angela', 'Piovan, Erich', 'Bongiovanni, Deborah', 'Di Martino, Ludovica', 'Minuzzo, Sonia', 'Tosello, Valeria', 'Zanovello, Paola']","['Saccomani V', 'Grassi A', 'Piovan E', 'Bongiovanni D', 'Di Martino L', 'Minuzzo S', 'Tosello V', 'Zanovello P']","['Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, Immunology & Oncology Section, University of Padova, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, Immunology & Oncology Section, University of Padova, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, Immunology & Oncology Section, University of Padova, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, Immunology & Oncology Section, University of Padova, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, Immunology & Oncology Section, University of Padova, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, Immunology & Oncology Section, University of Padova, 35128 Padua, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, 35128 Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (MIRN22 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn22 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', '*Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Receptor, Notch1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*NOTCH1', '*T-ALL', '*miR-22-3p']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/03/05 06:00,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9071726 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9071726 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Jul 18;9(7). pii: cells9071726. doi: 10.3390/cells9071726.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8313-8384', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4241-563X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8693-4776', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2588-6058', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9996-2669']",20200718,,,,PMC7408026,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI) transcription factors are the main downstream effectors of the HH signaling cascade and are responsible for the proliferation and maintenance of leukemic stem cells, which support chemotherapy resistance and leukemia relapse. Cytarabine (Ara-C)-resistant variants of AML cell lines were established through long-term cultivation with successively increasing Ara-C concentrations. Subsequently, differences in GLI expression were analyzed by RT-qPCR. GLI3 mRNA levels were detectable in parental Kasumi-1, OCI-AML3, and OCI-AML5 cells, whereas GLI3 expression was completely silenced in all resistant counterparts. Therefore, we generated GLI3-knockdown cell lines using small hairpin RNAs (shRNA) and evaluated their sensitivity to Ara-C in vitro. The knockdown of GLI3 partly abolished the effect of Ara-C on colony formation and induction of apoptosis, indicating that GLI3 downregulation results in Ara-C resistance. Moreover, we analyzed the expression of several genes involved in Ara-C metabolism and transport. Knockdown of GLI3 resulted in the upregulation of SAM and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), cytidine deaminase (CDA), and ATP-binding cassette C11 (ABCC11)/multidrug resistance-associated protein 8 (MRP8), each of which has been identified as a predictive marker for Ara-C response in acute myeloid leukemia.

Western blot analysis showed that 8q significantly down-regulated the phosphorylation level of retinoblastoma-associated protein (Rb) in a concentration-dependent manner, upon 48 h treatment. In addition, 8q induced K562 cells apoptosis, through both mitochondria-mediated and exogenous apoptotic pathways. Taken together, these results indicate that 8q effectively triggers G1 cell cycle arrest and induces cell apoptosis in K562 cells, by inhibiting the CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation of Rb. Furthermore, the possible binding interactions between 8q and CDK4/6 protein were clarified by homology modeling and molecular docking. In order to verify the inhibitory activity of 8q against other chronic myeloid leukemia cells, KCL-22 cells and K562 adriamycin-resistant cells (K562/ADR) were selected for the MTT assay. It is worth noting that 8q showed significant anti-proliferative activity against these cell lines after 48 h/72 h treatment. Therefore, this study provides new mechanistic information and guidance for the development of new acridones for application in the treatment of CML.","['Zhang, Bin', 'Zhang, Ting', 'Zhang, Tian-Yi', 'Wang, Ning', 'He, Shan', 'Wu, Bin', 'Jin, Hai-Xiao']","['Zhang B', 'Zhang T', 'Zhang TY', 'Wang N', 'He S', 'Wu B', 'Jin HX']","['Li Dak Sum Yip Yio Chin Kenneth Li Marine Biopharmaceutical Research Center, Department of Marine Pharmacy, College of Food and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315800, Zhejiang, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemical Oncogenomics, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Shenzhen 518055, China.', 'Li Dak Sum Yip Yio Chin Kenneth Li Marine Biopharmaceutical Research Center, Department of Marine Pharmacy, College of Food and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315800, Zhejiang, China.', 'Li Dak Sum Yip Yio Chin Kenneth Li Marine Biopharmaceutical Research Center, Department of Marine Pharmacy, College of Food and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315800, Zhejiang, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemical Oncogenomics, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology, Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Shenzhen 518055, China.', 'Institute of Drug Discovery Technology, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315800, Zhejiang, China.', 'Li Dak Sum Yip Yio Chin Kenneth Li Marine Biopharmaceutical Research Center, Department of Marine Pharmacy, College of Food and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315800, Zhejiang, China.', 'Ocean College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'Li Dak Sum Yip Yio Chin Kenneth Li Marine Biopharmaceutical Research Center, Department of Marine Pharmacy, College of Food and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315800, Zhejiang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*metabolism', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metabolomics', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['CDK4/6', 'acridone derivatives', 'anti-leukemia mechanism', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'metabolomics']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/03/06 06:00,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21145077 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21145077 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jul 18;21(14). pii: ijms21145077. doi: 10.3390/ijms21145077.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5625-5358', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0196-7278']",20200718,,,"['2018YFC0310900/the National Key Research and Development Program of China', '2018A610410/the Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo City', 'XYL18004, XYL20023/Foundation of Ningbo University for Grant', 'D16013/the National 111 Project of China']",PMC7403985,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study explores the associations between diet quality indices, cardiometabolic health indicators and inflammatory biomarkers among cALL survivors. Participants were part of the PETALE study (n = 241, median age: 21.7 years). Adherence to 6 dietary scores and caloric intake from ultra-processed foods were calculated. Multivariate logistirac regressions, Student t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests were performed. We found that 88% of adults and 46% of children adhered poorly to the Mediterranean diet, 36.9% had poor adherence to the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations and 76.3% had a diet to be improved according to the HEI-2015 score. On average, ultra-processed foods accounted for 51% of total energy intake. Low HDL-C was associated with a more inflammatory diet (E-DIITM score) and higher intake of ultra-processed foods. A greater E-DII score was associated with elevated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and consumption of ultra-processed foods was correlated with high triglycerides. Circulating levels of TNF-alpha, adiponectin and IL-6 were influenced by diet quality indices, while CRP and leptin were not. In conclusion, survivors of cALL have poor adherence to dietary recommendations, adversely affecting their cardiometabolic health.","['Berard, Sophie', 'Morel, Sophia', 'Teasdale, Emma', 'Shivappa, Nitin', 'Hebert, James R', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Levy, Emile', 'Marcil, Valerie']","['Berard S', 'Morel S', 'Teasdale E', 'Shivappa N', 'Hebert JR', 'Laverdiere C', 'Sinnett D', 'Levy E', 'Marcil V']","['Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Nutrition, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods, Laval University, Quebec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Nutrition, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods, Laval University, Quebec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Nutrition, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Cancer Prevention and Control Program, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA.', 'Cancer Prevention and Control Program, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Arnold School of Public Health, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Nutrition, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods, Laval University, Quebec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Department of Nutrition, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC H3T 1C5, Canada.', 'Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods, Laval University, Quebec City, QC G1V 0A6, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Nutrients,Nutrients,101521595,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cancer Survivors/psychology', 'Child', 'Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena/*physiology', '*Diet, Healthy', 'Diet, Mediterranean', 'Energy Intake/*physiology', 'Fast Foods/*adverse effects', 'Female', '*Heart Disease Risk Factors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Male', '*Patient Compliance', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/psychology', 'Prognosis', 'Recommended Dietary Allowances', 'Triglycerides/blood', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/blood', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'cardiometabolic complications', 'dietary scores', 'nutrition', 'oncology', 'pediatrics', 'survivors']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/03/16 06:00,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['nu12072137 [pii]', '10.3390/nu12072137 [doi]']",epublish,Nutrients. 2020 Jul 18;12(7). pii: nu12072137. doi: 10.3390/nu12072137.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5055-2784', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0677-2672', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3625-6676', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9983-7027']",20200718,,,"['TCF 118694/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'N/A/Fonds de Recherche du Quebec - Sante', 'N/A/Cole Foundation']",PMC7400871,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Oxidative stress (OxS) is considered an important modulator of telomere shortening and telomerase activity. One of the fruits that has been associated with an antioxidant effect is Sechium edule and although its properties are well established, there is only one exploratory study evaluating its effectiveness in patients with MetS. The present investigation is a much more robust and controlled study, including a placebo group. Hence, we determined the effect of consumption of the dried fruit powder (500 mg, three times per day) for three months. We measured effects on telomerase levels, antioxidant capacity, and markers for OxS. The study was performed in a sample of 75 older adults: placebo group (n = 30) and experimental group (n = 45) with the diagnosis of MetS according to the National Adult Treatment Panel of the National Cholesterol Program III (NCEP/ATP III) criteria. All markers were measured before and after three months of treatment. There was a statistically significant decrease in lipoperoxides and protein carbonylation with an increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as sustained levels of telomerase in patients who consumed Sechium edule. Our findings suggest that consumption of this fruit has a hypoglycemic, hypotensive, and antioxidant effect, without altering telomerase levels, which could suggest better protection against telomere shortening.","['Gavia-Garcia, Graciela', 'Rosado-Perez, Juana', 'Aguiniga-Sanchez, Itzen', 'Santiago-Osorio, Edelmiro', 'Mendoza-Nunez, Victor Manuel']","['Gavia-Garcia G', 'Rosado-Perez J', 'Aguiniga-Sanchez I', 'Santiago-Osorio E', 'Mendoza-Nunez VM']","['Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City 09230, Mexico.', 'Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City 09230, Mexico.', 'Hematopoiesis and Leukemia Laboratory, Research Unit on Cell Differentiation and Cancer, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City 09230, Mexico.', 'Hematopoiesis and Leukemia Laboratory, Research Unit on Cell Differentiation and Cancer, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City 09230, Mexico.', 'Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City 09230, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Antioxidants (Basel),"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",101668981,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['S. edule', 'ageing', 'antioxidants', 'metabolic syndrome', 'oxidative stress', 'telomerase']",2020/07/28 06:00,2020/07/28 06:01,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['antiox9070634 [pii]', '10.3390/antiox9070634 [doi]']",epublish,Antioxidants (Basel). 2020 Jul 18;9(7). pii: antiox9070634. doi: 10.3390/antiox9070634.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1692-8287'],20200718,,,,PMC7402181,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SRC-family kinases (SFKs) play crucial roles in normal hematopoiesis. Not surprisingly, they are hyperactivated and are essential for membrane receptor downstream signaling in hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and mastocytosis. The precise roles of SFKs are difficult to delineate due to the number of substrates, the functional redundancy among members, and the use of tools that are not selective. Yet, a large num ber of studies have accumulated evidence to support that SFKs are rational therapeutic targets in AML and mastocytosis. These two pathologies are regulated by two related receptor tyrosine kinases, which are well known in the field of hematology: FLT3 and KIT. FLT3 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in AML, while KIT oncogenic mutations occur in 80-90% of mastocytosis. Studies on oncogenic FLT3 and KIT signaling have shed light on specific roles for members of the SFK family. This review highlights the central roles of SFKs in AML and mastocytosis, and their interconnection with FLT3 and KIT oncoproteins.","['Voisset, Edwige', 'Brenet, Fabienne', 'Lopez, Sophie', 'de Sepulveda, Paulo']","['Voisset E', 'Brenet F', 'Lopez S', 'de Sepulveda P']","['INSERM U1068, CNRS UMR7258, Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Institute Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM-Cancer Research Center of Marseille, U1068 Marseille, France.', 'INSERM U1068, CNRS UMR7258, Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Institute Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM-Cancer Research Center of Marseille, U1068 Marseille, France.', 'INSERM U1068, CNRS UMR7258, Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Institute Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM-Cancer Research Center of Marseille, U1068 Marseille, France.', 'INSERM U1068, CNRS UMR7258, Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, Institute Paoli-Calmettes, CRCM-Cancer Research Center of Marseille, U1068 Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FLT3', 'KIT', 'SFK', 'kinase inhibitor', 'mastocytosis', 'protein kinase']",2020/07/28 06:00,2020/07/28 06:01,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12071996 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12071996 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jul 21;12(7). pii: cancers12071996. doi: 10.3390/cancers12071996.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0943-4847', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4098-1096', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5009-5533', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8295-5414']",20200721,,,,PMC7409304,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study of newly diagnosed CLL patients, which included 39 CD38-positive and 22 CD38-negative patients, CCR1 and/or CCR2 were always detected, using flow cytometry, on the peripheral blood (PB) CD19(+)CD5(+) lymphocytes in patients with >30% of the CD38(+) CD19(+)CD5(+) lymphocytes (n = 16). Spearman's rank correlation analysis determined correlations between the frequency of the CCR1- and CCR2-expressing PB CD19(+)CD5(+) lymphocytes and the frequency of the CD38-positive CD19(+)CD5(+) lymphocytes (rs = 0.50 and rs = 0.38, respectively). No significant correlations were observed between ZAP70 mRNA expression levels in PB mononuclear cells and the frequency of the circulating CCR1(+) or CCR2(+) CD19(+)CD5(+) lymphocytes. Further association studies are needed to verify prognostic relevance of the CCR1/CCR2 expression on leukemic cells in CLL patients at diagnosis.

These results indicated that the stem bark of Vietnamese E. fordii and its cassaine diterpenoid amides may be useful in the apoptosis induction of human leukemia cancer cells.","['Nguyen, Tu Thanh Thi', 'To, Dao Cuong', 'Vo, Phuong Hien Thi', 'Tran, Thanh Hoa', 'Nguyen, Phi Hung', 'Nguyen, Hien Minh', 'Tran, Manh Hung']","['Nguyen TTT', 'To DC', 'Vo PHT', 'Tran TH', 'Nguyen PH', 'Nguyen HM', 'Tran MH']","['Traditional Medicine Faculty, Hanoi Medical University, 1 Ton That Tung street, Dong Da District, Hanoi 116001, Vietnam.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Phenikaa University, Yen Nghia, Ha Dong district, Hanoi 12116, Vietnam.', 'Phenikaa Research and Technology Institute (PRATI), A&A Green Phoenix Group JSC, 167 Hoang Ngan, Cau Giay District, Hanoi 11313, Vietnam.', 'Faculty of Biology and Biotechnology, University of Science, Vietnam National University Hochiminh City, 227 Nguyen Van Cu street, District 5, Ho Chi Minh City 748000, Vietnam.', 'Biomedical Science Department, VNUK Institute for Research & Executive Education, The University of Danang, 158A Le Loi street, Hai Chau District, Danang City 551000, Vietnam.', 'Institute of Natural Products Chemistry, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), 18 Hoang Quoc Viet street, Cau Giay District, Hanoi 122100, Vietnam.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Ton Duc Thang University, 19 Nguyen Huu Tho street, District 7, Ho Chi Minh City 758307, Vietnam.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, University of Science, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh city, 227 Nguyen Van Cu Street, District 5, Ho Chi Minh City 748000, Vietnam.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Amides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'PQK203C49T (cassaine)']",IM,"['Abietanes/*chemistry', 'Alkaloids/*chemistry', 'Allosteric Site', 'Amides/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Diterpenes/*chemistry', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fabaceae/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Plant Bark/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Binding']",['NOTNLM'],"['3beta-acetyl-nor-erythrophlamide', 'Erythrophleum fordii oliver', 'caesalpinioideae', 'cassaine diterpenoid', 'human leukemia cancer cells', 'molecular docking']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/03/18 06:00,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/18 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25143304 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25143304 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Jul 21;25(14). pii: molecules25143304. doi: 10.3390/molecules25143304.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5563-0670', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6678-4253', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3061-7952']",20200721,,,['104.01-2017.57/National Foundation for Science and Technology Development'],PMC7397343,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adjuvant chemotherapeutics (ACs) have been extensively developed to improve the survival rate of such patients, but conventionally formulated ACs inevitably distribute toxic chemotherapeutic drugs to healthy organs and thus often trigger severe side effects. CRC cells may also develop drug resistance following repeat dosing of conventional ACs, limiting their effectiveness. Given these limitations, researchers have sought to use targeted drug delivery systems (DDSs), specifically the nanotechnology-based DDSs, to deliver the ACs. As lipid-based nanoplatforms have shown the potential to improve the efficacy and safety of various cytotoxic drugs (such as paclitaxel and vincristine) in the clinical treatment of gastric cancer and leukemia, the preclinical progress of lipid-based nanoplatforms has attracted increasing interest. The lipid-based nanoplatforms might be the most promising DDSs to succeed in entering a clinical trial for CRC treatment. This review will briefly examine the history of preclinical research on lipid-based nanoplatforms, summarize the current progress, and discuss the challenges and prospects of using such approaches in the treatment of CRC.","['Yang, Chunhua', 'Merlin, Didier']","['Yang C', 'Merlin D']","['Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Digestive Disease Research Group, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30302, USA.', 'Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Digestive Disease Research Group, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30302, USA.', 'Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Decatur, GA 30033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Nanomaterials (Basel),"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",101610216,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['colorectal cancer', 'exosomes', 'lipid-based nanoparticles', 'plant-derived lipid nanoparticles', 'targeted drug delivery']",2020/07/28 06:00,2020/07/28 06:01,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['nano10071424 [pii]', '10.3390/nano10071424 [doi]']",epublish,Nanomaterials (Basel). 2020 Jul 21;10(7). pii: nano10071424. doi: 10.3390/nano10071424.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0805-1008'],20200721,,,"['RO1-DK-116306/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'RO1-DK-107739/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'BX002526/U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs', 'BX004476/U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs']",PMC7408503,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted this study to investigate the feasibility of CBT for adult patients with acute leukemia with regards to impact of different conditioning and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimens on clinical outcomes. From 16 centers in Korea, 41 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 29 ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) patients undergoing CBT were enrolled. For AML patients, the neutrophil engraftment was observed in 87.5% of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and 72.0% of myeloablative conditioning (MAC) (p = 0.242). The median RFS was 5 months and OS 7 months. Conditioning regimen did not affect relapse free survival (RFS) or overall survival (OS). GVHD prophylaxis using calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) plus methotrexate was associated with better RFS compared to CNI plus ATG (p = 0.032). For ALL patients, neutrophil engraftment was observed in 55.6% of RIC and 90.0% of MAC (p = 0.034). The median RFS was 5 months and OS 19 months. MAC regimens, especially total body irradiation (TBI)-based regimen, were associated with both longer RFS and OS compared to other conditioning regimens. In conclusion, individualized conditioning regimens will add value in terms of enhancing safety and efficacy of CBT.","['Byun, Ja Min', 'Hong, Junshik', 'Oh, Doyeun', 'Yhim, Ho-Young', 'Do, Young Rok', 'Park, Joon Seong', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Yang, Deok-Hwan', 'Won, Jong-Ho', 'Lee, Hong Ghi', 'Moon, Joon Ho', 'Mun, Yeung-Chul', 'Jo, Deog-Yeon', 'Han, Jae Joon', 'Lee, Je-Hwan', 'Lee, Jae Hoon', 'Lee, Junglim', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo']","['Byun JM', 'Hong J', 'Oh D', 'Yhim HY', 'Do YR', 'Park JS', 'Jung CW', 'Yang DH', 'Won JH', 'Lee HG', 'Moon JH', 'Mun YC', 'Jo DY', 'Han JJ', 'Lee JH', 'Lee JH', 'Lee J', 'Yoon SS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, 101, Daehak-ro, Jongro-gu, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, 101, Daehak-ro, Jongro-gu, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, CHA University School of Medicine, Seongnam 13496, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Jeonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju 54907, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dongsan Medical Center, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu 42601, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon 16499, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul 06351, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun 58128, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital, Seoul 04401, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Konkuk University Medical Center, Seoul 05030, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41944, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul 07985, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chungnam National University College of Medicine, Daejeon 35015, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, College of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02447, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul 05505, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University College of Medicine Gil Medical Center, Incheon 21565, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Daegu Fatima Hospital, 99, Ayang-ro, Dong-gu, Daegu 41199, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, 101, Daehak-ro, Jongro-gu, Seoul 03080, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'conditioning', 'cord blood transplantation']",2020/07/28 06:00,2020/07/28 06:01,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9072310 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9072310 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Jul 21;9(7). pii: jcm9072310. doi: 10.3390/jcm9072310.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1780-5553', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6981-3144', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2591-7459']",20200721,,,,PMC7408460,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, such cancer cells often are highly dependent on Bcl-2 for their survival, a feature that is exploited by so-called BH3-mimetic drugs. Venetoclax (ABT-199) is a selective BH3-mimetic Bcl-2 antagonist that is currently used in the clinic for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. Unfortunately, venetoclax resistance has already emerged in patients, limiting the therapeutic success. Here, we examined strategies to overcome venetoclax resistance. Therefore, we used two diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines, Riva WT and venetoclax-resistant Riva (VR). The latter was obtained by prolonged culturing in the presence of venetoclax. We report that Riva VR cells did not become more sensitive to BIRD-2, a peptide targeting the Bcl-2 BH4 domain, and established cross-resistance towards BDA-366, a putative BH4-domain antagonist of Bcl-2. However, we found that Bcl-XL, another Bcl-2-family protein, is upregulated in Riva VR, while Mcl-1 expression levels are not different in comparison with Riva WT, hinting towards an increased dependence of Riva VR cells to Bcl-XL. Indeed, Riva VR cells could be resensitized to venetoclax by A-1155463, a selective BH3 mimetic Bcl-XL inhibitor. This is underpinned by siRNA experiments, demonstrating that lowering Bcl-XL-expression levels also augmented the sensitivity of Riva VR cells to venetoclax. Overall, this work demonstrates that Bcl-XL upregulation contributes to acquired resistance of DLBCL cancer cells towards venetoclax and that antagonizing Bcl-XL can resensitize such cells towards venetoclax.","['Kerkhofs, Martijn', 'Vervloessem, Tamara', 'Stopa, Kinga B', 'Smith, Victoria M', 'Vogler, Meike', 'Bultynck, Geert']","['Kerkhofs M', 'Vervloessem T', 'Stopa KB', 'Smith VM', 'Vogler M', 'Bultynck G']","['Lab.

Murine models of leukemia have been instrumental in understanding the biology of the disease and identifying therapeutics. However, such models are time consuming and expensive in high throughput genetic and drug screening. Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as an invaluable in vivo model for studying different diseases, including cancer. Fruit flies possess several hematopoietic processes and compartments that are in close resemblance to their mammalian counterparts. A number of studies succeeded in characterizing the fly's response upon the expression of human leukemogenic proteins in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tissues. Moreover, some of these studies showed that these models are amenable to genetic screening. However, none were reported to be tested for drug screening. In this review, we describe the Drosophila hematopoietic system, briefly focusing on leukemic diseases in which fruit flies have been used. We discuss myeloid and lymphoid leukemia fruit fly models and we further highlight their roles for future therapeutic screening. In conclusion, fruit fly leukemia models constitute an interesting area which could speed up the process of integrating new therapeutics when complemented with mammalian models.","['Al Outa, Amani', 'Abubaker, Dana', 'Madi, Joelle', 'Nasr, Rihab', 'Shirinian, Margret']","['Al Outa A', 'Abubaker D', 'Madi J', 'Nasr R', 'Shirinian M']","['Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut 1107 2020, Lebanon.', 'Department of Experimental Pathology, Immunology and Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut 1107 2020, Lebanon.', 'Center for Infectious Diseases Research, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut 1107 2020, Lebanon.', 'Department of Experimental Pathology, Immunology and Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut 1107 2020, Lebanon.', 'Center for Infectious Diseases Research, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut 1107 2020, Lebanon.', 'Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut 1107 2020, Lebanon.', 'Department of Experimental Pathology, Immunology and Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut 1107 2020, Lebanon.', 'Center for Infectious Diseases Research, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut 1107 2020, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics/*physiology', 'Drug Discovery', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Oncogenes']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Drosophila melanogaster', '*blood cancer', '*drug screening', '*fruit fly', '*leukemia']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/03/06 06:00,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9071737 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9071737 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Jul 21;9(7). pii: cells9071737. doi: 10.3390/cells9071737.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1166-4999'],20200721,,,,PMC7409271,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Hippo pathway has been implicated in gastric CSC properties and was shown to be regulated by leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and its ligand LIF in breast cancer. This study aimed to determine LIF's effect on CSC properties in GC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells, which remains unexplored. LIF's treatment effect on CSC markers expression and tumoursphere formation was evaluated. The Hippo kinase inhibitor XMU-MP-1 and/or the JAK1 inhibitor Ruxolitinib were used to determine Hippo and canonical JAK/STAT pathway involvement in gastric CSCs' response to LIF. Results indicate that LIF decreased tumorigenic and chemo-resistant CSCs, in both GC cell lines and PDX cells. In addition, LIF increased activation of LATS1/2 Hippo kinases, thereby decreasing downstream YAP/TAZ nuclear accumulation and TEAD transcriptional activity. LIF's anti-CSC effect was reversed by XMU-MP-1 but not by Ruxolitinib treatment, highlighting the opposite effects of these two pathways downstream LIFR. In conclusion, LIF displays anti-CSC properties in GC, through Hippo kinases activation, and could in fine constitute a new CSCs-targeting strategy to help decrease relapse cases and bad prognosis in GC.","['Seeneevassen, Lornella', 'Giraud, Julie', 'Molina-Castro, Silvia', 'Sifre, Elodie', 'Tiffon, Camille', 'Beauvoit, Clementine', 'Staedel, Cathy', 'Megraud, Francis', 'Lehours, Philippe', 'Martin, Oceane C B', 'Boeuf, Helene', 'Dubus, Pierre', 'Varon, Christine']","['Seeneevassen L', 'Giraud J', 'Molina-Castro S', 'Sifre E', 'Tiffon C', 'Beauvoit C', 'Staedel C', 'Megraud F', 'Lehours P', 'Martin OCB', 'Boeuf H', 'Dubus P', 'Varon C']","['INSERM U1053, Bordeaux Research in Translational Oncology, Univ.

Our aim was to investigate the role of ATG5 protein in neutrophils' antimicrobial functions, proliferation and apoptosis. To this end, we used genetically modified human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells overexpressing ATG5, differentiated toward granulocyte-like cells with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and dimethylformamide. The level of differentiation, phagocytosis, proliferation and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. ROS production and NETs release was assessed by fluorometry and fluorescent microscopy. ATG5 gene expression was evaluated by real-time PCR, whereas the protein level of ATG5 and LC3-II was determined by Western blot. We did not observe the induction of autophagy in differentiated HL-60 cells overexpressing ATG5. The increased expression of ATG5 affects the differentiation of HL-60 cells with ATRA, ROS production and phagocytosis. However, we did not detect changes in NETs release. Moreover, ATG5 protects differentiated HL-60 cells from apoptosis but does not cause changes in proliferation rate.","['Mroczek, Agnieszka', 'Cieloch, Adrianna', 'Manda-Handzlik, Aneta', 'Kuzmicka, Weronika', 'Muchowicz, Angelika', 'Wachowska, Malgorzata']","['Mroczek A', 'Cieloch A', 'Manda-Handzlik A', 'Kuzmicka W', 'Muchowicz A', 'Wachowska M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Clinical Immunology of Developmental Age, Medical University of Warsaw, Zwirki i Wigury 63a Street, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Clinical Immunology of Developmental Age, Medical University of Warsaw, Zwirki i Wigury 63a Street, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Clinical Immunology of Developmental Age, Medical University of Warsaw, Zwirki i Wigury 63a Street, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Zwirki i Wigury 61 Street, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Clinical Immunology of Developmental Age, Medical University of Warsaw, Zwirki i Wigury 63a Street, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Zwirki i Wigury 61 Street, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Jana Nielubowicza 5 Street, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Clinical Immunology of Developmental Age, Medical University of Warsaw, Zwirki i Wigury 63a Street, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (ATG5 protein, human)', '0 (Autophagy-Related Protein 5)', '0 (MAP1LC3B protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '8696NH0Y2X (Dimethylformamide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*genetics', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 5/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dimethylformamide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['ATG5', 'autophagy', 'neutrophils', 'neutrophils functions', 'promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60)']",2020/07/28 06:00,2021/03/05 06:00,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21155194 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21155194 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jul 22;21(15). pii: ijms21155194. doi: 10.3390/ijms21155194.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3766-5466'],20200722,,,['POWROTY/2016-2/7/Fundacja na rzecz Nauki Polskiej'],PMC7432007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, multi-drug resistance is another important problem in anticancer treatment. Due to problems such as cytotoxicity and drug resistance, many investigations are being conducted to discover and develop effective anticancer drugs. In recent years, researchers have focused on the anticancer activity coumarins, due to their high biological activity and low toxicity. Coumarins are commonly used in the treatment of prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma and leukemia, and they also have the ability to counteract the side effects caused by radiotherapy. Both natural and synthetic coumarin derivatives draw attention due to their photochemotherapy and therapeutic applications in cancer. In this review, a compilation of various research reports on coumarins with anticancer activity and investigation and a review of structure-activity relationship studies on coumarin core are presented. Determination of important structural features around the coumarin core may help researchers to design and develop new analogues with a strong anticancer effect and reduce the potential side effects of existing therapeutics.","['Kupeli Akkol, Esra', 'Genc, Yasin', 'Karpuz, Busra', 'Sobarzo-Sanchez, Eduardo', 'Capasso, Raffaele']","['Kupeli Akkol E', 'Genc Y', 'Karpuz B', 'Sobarzo-Sanchez E', 'Capasso R']","['Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Gazi University, Etiler 06330, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Hacettepe University, Sihhiye 06100, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Gazi University, Etiler 06330, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Instituto de Investigacion e Innovacion en Salud, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Central de Chile, 8330507 Santiago, Chile.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Santiago de Compostela, 15782 Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, 80055 Portici (Naples), Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Benzopyrone', 'cancer', 'coumarin', 'drug discovery', 'natural product']",2020/07/28 06:00,2020/07/28 06:01,['2020/07/26 06:00'],"['2020/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12071959 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12071959 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jul 19;12(7). pii: cancers12071959. doi: 10.3390/cancers12071959.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5829-7869', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2790-2544', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3335-1822']",20200719,,,,PMC7409047,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SRARP is located on chromosome 1p36.13 and is widely inactivated by deletions and epigenetic silencing in malignancies. Therefore, additional studies are required to explore SRARP as a potential cancer biomarker. AIM: This study explores the application of SRARP as a novel biomarker in malignancies of multiple tissue origins using the analysis of large genomic datasets. METHODS AND RESULTS: A comprehensive genomic analysis of large cancer datasets was carried out to examine the association of SRARP expression and copy-number with molecular and clinical features in malignancies of multiple tissue origins. This study demonstrated that SRARP under-expression and copy-number loss are strongly associated with the loss of other tumor suppressors such as TP53 and NF1 mutations and oncogenic gains, including N-MYC amplification and ERG rearrangement, suggesting that SRARP inactivation is associated with wider genomic instability in malignancies. Importantly, SRARP under-expression and copy-number loss are strong predictors of poor clinical and/or pathological features in breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, gastric, endometrial, cervical, brain, ovarian, bladder, thyroid, and hepatocellular cancers as well as neuroblastoma, uveal melanoma, and acute myeloid leukemia with highly significant odds ratios. Finally, higher SRARP expression and copy-number predict a better response to several cancer drugs. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the SRARP inactivation presents a robust biomarker in predicting molecular and clinicopathological features, and treatment response in malignancies.","['Naderi, Ali']",['Naderi A'],"['Cancer Biology Program, University of Hawaii Cancer Center, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Rep (Hoboken),"Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",101747728,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (SRARP protein, human)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*SRARP', '*biomarker', '*cancer outcome', '*treatment response']",2020/07/25 06:00,2021/11/27 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cnr2.1267 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Rep (Hoboken). 2020 Oct;3(5):e1267. doi: 10.1002/cnr2.1267.

In this study, we applied this novel measure to examine trends in premature mortality caused by hematological cancers in Canada from 1980 to 2015. Mortality data for Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia were obtained from the World Health Organization mortality database. Years of life lost was calculated according to Canadian life tables. ALSS was defined as the ratio between years of life lost and expected life span. Over the study period, age-standardized rates of mortality decreased for all types of hematological cancers. Our new ALSS measure showed favorable trends in premature mortality for all types of hematological cancers among both sexes. For instance, men with non-Hodgkin lymphoma lost an average of 23.7% of their life span in 1980 versus 16.1% in 2015, while women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma lost an average of 21.7% of their life span in 1980 versus 15.5% in 2015.

RESULTS: Of 1149 GHD survivors on GHT for >/=5 years (male 733; median age 8.4 years; GH peak 2.8 ng/mL), 431 had craniopharyngioma (251, cranial RT), 224 medulloblastoma (craniospinal RT), 134 leukemia (72 TBI), and 360 other tumors. Median age differed by tumor group (P < 0.001). Five-year delta height SD score (SDS) (5-year HtSDS; median [10th-90th percentile]) was greatest for craniopharyngioma, 1.6 (0.3-3.0); for medulloblastoma, 5-year HtSDS 0.9 (0.0-1.9); for leukemia 5-year HtSDS, after TBI (0.3, 0-0.7) versus without RT (0.5, 0-0.9), direct comparison P < 0.001. Adverse events included 40 treatment-related, but none unexpected. CONCLUSIONS: TBI for leukemia had significant impact on growth response to GHT. Medulloblastoma survivors had intermediate GHT response, whereas craniopharyngioma cranial RT did not alter GHT response. Both craniospinal and epiphyseal irradiation negatively affect growth response to GH therapy compared with only cranial RT or no RT.","['Rose, Susan R', 'Carlsson, Martin', 'Grimberg, Adda', 'Aydin, Ferah', 'Albanese, Assunta', 'Hokken-Koelega, Anita C S', 'Camacho-Hubner, Cecilia']","['Rose SR', 'Carlsson M', 'Grimberg A', 'Aydin F', 'Albanese A', 'Hokken-Koelega ACS', 'Camacho-Hubner C']","[""Pediatric Endocrinology and Metabolism, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio."", 'Pfizer Inc., Endocrine Care, New York, New York.', ""Perelman School of Medicine, Univ. of Pennsylvania, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Pfizer Health AB, Endocrine Care, Sollentuna, Sweden.', ""St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK."", 'Dutch Growth Research Foundation, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Erasmus University Medical Center, Sophia's Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Endocrinology, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Pfizer Inc., Endocrine Care, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Cancer Survivors/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Extremities/growth & development/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Growth Hormone/*deficiency', 'Growth Plate/radiation effects', 'Hormone Replacement Therapy/adverse effects/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Human Growth Hormone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Skull/radiation effects', 'Spine/radiation effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer survivors', '*dose response', '*growth hormone deficiency', '*growth hormone therapy', '*pediatric', '*radiation therapy']",2020/07/25 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['5876029 [pii]', '10.1210/clinem/dgaa478 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2020 Oct 1;105(10). pii: 5876029. doi: 10.1210/clinem/dgaa478.,,,,['(c) Endocrine Society 2020.'],,PMC7462257,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the detection of ALL, it is essential to analyse the white blood cells (WBCs) for which the blood smear images are employed. This paper proposes a new technique for the segmentation and classification of the acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The proposed method of automatic leukaemia detection is based on the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (Deep CNN) that is trained using an optimization algorithm, named Grey wolf-based Jaya Optimization Algorithm (GreyJOA), which is developed using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Jaya Optimization Algorithm (JOA) that improves the global convergence. Initially, the input image is applied to pre-processing and the segmentation is performed using the Sparse Fuzzy C-Means (Sparse FCM) clustering algorithm. Then, the features, such as Local Directional Patterns (LDP) and colour histogram-based features, are extracted from the segments of the pre-processed input image. Finally, the extracted features are applied to the Deep CNN for the classification. The experimentation evaluation of the method using the images of the ALL IDB2 database reveals that the proposed method acquired a maximal accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.9350, 0.9528, and 0.9389, respectively.","['Praveena, Segu', 'Singh, Sohan Pal']","['Praveena S', 'Singh SP']","['Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology, Kokapet, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology, Kokapet, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Biomed Tech (Berl),Biomedizinische Technik.

We hypothesized that chemohormonal therapy (CHT) with androgen-deprivation therapy plus docetaxel before RP would improve biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) over RP alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men with clinically localized, high-risk PC were assigned to RP alone or neoadjuvant CHT with androgen deprivation plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) body surface area every 3 weeks for 6 cycles) and RP. The primary end point was 3-year BPFS. Biochemical failure was defined as a serum prostate-specific antigen level > 0.2 ng/mL that increased on 2 consecutive occasions that were at least 3 months apart. Secondary end points included 5-year BPFS, overall BPFS, local recurrence, metastasis-free survival (MFS), PC-specific mortality, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: In total, 788 men were randomly assigned. Median follow-up time was 6.1 years. The overall rates of grade 3 and 4 adverse events during chemotherapy were 26% and 19%, respectively. No difference was seen in 3-year BPFS between neoadjuvant CHT plus RP and RP alone (0.89 v 0.84, respectively; 95% CI for the difference, -0.01 to 0.11; P = .11). Neoadjuvant CHT was associated with improved overall BPFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.99), improved MFS (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.95), and improved OS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.94) compared with RP alone. CONCLUSION: The primary study end point, 3-year BPFS, was not met. Although some improvement was seen in secondary end points, any potential benefit must be weighed against toxicity. Our data do not support the routine use of neoadjuvant CHT and RP in patients with clinically localized, high-risk PC at this time.","['Eastham, James A', 'Heller, Glenn', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Monk, J Paul 3rd', 'Beltran, Himisha', 'Gleave, Martin', 'Evans, Christopher P', 'Clinton, Steven K', 'Szmulewitz, Russell Z', 'Coleman, Jonathan', 'Hillman, David W', 'Watt, Colleen R', 'George, Saby', 'Sanda, Martin G', 'Hahn, Olwen M', 'Taplin, Mary-Ellen', 'Parsons, J Kellogg', 'Mohler, James L', 'Small, Eric J', 'Morris, Michael J']","['Eastham JA', 'Heller G', 'Halabi S', 'Monk JP 3rd', 'Beltran H', 'Gleave M', 'Evans CP', 'Clinton SK', 'Szmulewitz RZ', 'Coleman J', 'Hillman DW', 'Watt CR', 'George S', 'Sanda MG', 'Hahn OM', 'Taplin ME', 'Parsons JK', 'Mohler JL', 'Small EJ', 'Morris MJ']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, NC.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, The James Cancer Hospital, Columbus, OH.', 'Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare, Boston, MA.', 'University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'University of California, Davis, Sacramento, CA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, The James Cancer Hospital, Columbus, OH.', 'University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chicago, IL.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Alliance Protocol Operations Office, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY.', 'Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Alliance Protocol Operations Office, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare, Boston, MA.', 'University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA.', 'Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY.', 'University of California, San Francisco, Medical Center-Mount Zion, San Francisco, CA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Androgen Antagonists)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/mortality/secondary/*therapy', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Androgen Antagonists/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Disease Progression', 'Docetaxel/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoadjuvant Therapy/adverse effects/mortality', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Progression-Free Survival', '*Prostatectomy/adverse effects/mortality', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",,,2020/07/25 06:00,2021/02/25 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.20.00315 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 Sep 10;38(26):3042-3050. doi: 10.1200/JCO.20.00315.

METHODS: We assessed all-cause and health-related late mortality (including late effects of cancer therapy), subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs), chronic health conditions, and neurocognitive outcomes among 6,148 survivors of childhood ALL (median age, 27.9 years; range, 5.9-61.9 years) diagnosed between 1970 and 1999. Therapy combinations and treatment intensity defined 6 groups: 1970s-like (70s), standard- or high-risk 1980s-like (80sSR, 80sHR) and 1990s-like (90sSR, 90sHR), and relapse/transplantation (R/BMT). Cumulative incidence, standardized mortality ratios, and standardized incidence ratios were compared between treatment groups and with the US population. RESULTS: Overall, 20-year all-cause late mortality was 6.6% (95% CI, 6.0 to 7.1). Compared with 70s, 90sSR and 90sHR experienced lower health-related late mortality (rate ratio [95% CI]: 90sSR, 0.2 [0.1 to 0.4]; 90sHR, 0.3 [0.1 to 0.7]), comparable to the US population (standardized mortality ratio [95% CI]: 90sSR, 1.3 [0.8 to 2.0]; 90sHR, 1.7 [0.7 to 3.5]). Compared with 70s, 90sSR had a lower rate of SMN (rate ratio [95% CI], 0.3 [0.1 to 0.6]) that was not different from that of the US population (standardized incidence ratio [95% CI], 1.0 [0.6 to 1.6]). The 90sSR group had fewer severe chronic health conditions than the 70s (20-year cumulative incidence [95% CI], 11.0% [9.7% to 12.3%] v 22.5% [19.4% to 25.5%]) and a lower prevalence of impaired memory (prevalence ratio [95% CI], 0.7 [0.6 to 0.9]) and task efficiency (0.5 [0.4 to 0.7]). CONCLUSION: Risk-stratified therapy has reduced late morbidity and mortality among contemporary survivors of standard-risk ALL, represented by 90sSR. Health-related late mortality and SMN risks among 5-year survivors of contemporary, standard-risk childhood ALL are comparable to the general population.","['Dixon, Stephanie B', 'Chen, Yan', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Green, Daniel M', 'Howell, Rebecca M', 'Leisenring, Wendy M', 'Kadan-Lottick, Nina S', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Nathan, Paul C']","['Dixon SB', 'Chen Y', 'Yasui Y', 'Pui CH', 'Hunger SP', 'Silverman LB', 'Ness KK', 'Green DM', 'Howell RM', 'Leisenring WM', 'Kadan-Lottick NS', 'Krull KR', 'Oeffinger KC', 'Neglia JP', 'Mertens AC', 'Hudson MM', 'Robison LL', 'Armstrong GT', 'Nathan PC']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'School of Public Health, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Division of Oncology and the Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Radiation Physics Department, The University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Cancer Prevention and Clinical Statistics Programs, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Psychology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, NC.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA.', ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morbidity', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/epidemiology/*mortality/radiotherapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/07/25 06:00,2021/03/05 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.20.00493 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 Oct 10;38(29):3418-3429. doi: 10.1200/JCO.20.00493.

Recent studies, however, suggest older patients can tolerate and potentially benefit from intensive chemotherapeutic regimens. The ability to compare the utility of varying regimen intensities in AML is hindered by the lack of a standardized definition of ""regimen intensity."" METHODS: We conducted a survey asking AML physicians which of 38 regimens they would consider intensive vs less-intensive. Electronic medical records of 592 patients receiving many of these regimens were used to design a model characterizing regimens as intensive vs less-intensive as identified by >/=75% physician consensus. Variables included frequency and length of hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, severe gastrointestinal toxicities, time to nadir, and recovery of neutrophil/platelet count. RESULTS: Physicians agreed at a rate of 75%-100% on the assignment of degree of intensity to the majority (n = 28) of these regimens, while the level of agreement was <75% for the remaining 10 regimens (26%). Logistic regression analyses identified number and length of hospitalizations to be significantly associated with intensive regimens and count recovery with less-intensive regimens. We created the ""regimen-intensity per count-recovery and hospitalization"" (RICH) index with an AUC of 0.87. Independent model validation yielded an AUC of 0.75. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to generate a novel model that defines regimen intensity for many therapies used to treat AML. Results facilitate a future randomized study comparing intensive vs less-intensive regimens.","['Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Agarwal, Shirali', 'Othus, Megan', 'Lynch, Ylinne', 'Nyland, Jennifer E', 'Percival, Mary-Elizabeth', 'Becker, Pamela S', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Estey, Elihu H']","['Sorror ML', 'Agarwal S', 'Othus M', 'Lynch Y', 'Nyland JE', 'Percival ME', 'Becker PS', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Estey EH']","['Divisions of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Divisions of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Division of Public Health Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Divisions of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Divisions of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Divisions of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Divisions of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Divisions of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Divisions of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/classification/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects', '*Clinical Decision Rules', 'Health Care Surveys', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects', 'Platelet Count', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*expert opinion', '*induction therapy', '*intensity', '*survey']",2020/07/25 06:00,2021/07/21 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3311 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2020 Sep;9(18):6515-6523. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3311.

Childhood and AYA acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) incidence and obesity prevalence have shown concurrent increases. We sought to identify whether obesity may be a risk factor for childhood and AYA ALL. METHODS: Characteristics from individuals with ALL, aged 2-30 years, diagnosed 2004-2017 and treated on Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols with available pre-treatment anthropometric data (N = 4726) were compared to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey controls (COG AALL17D2). Body mass index (BMI) was defined using standard CDC definitions. Multivariate conditional logistic regression assessed associations between BMI and ALL with additional analyses stratified by sex and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Among cases (72% high-risk (HR) B-ALL, 28% T-ALL), 5% had underweight, 58% normal weight, 17% overweight, and 20% obesity. Underweight (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.56-2.85) and obesity (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.15-1.53) were associated with B-ALL diagnosis. Specifically, obesity was associated with B-ALL among males (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.30-1.91) and Hispanic children (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.39-2.29). Obesity was also associated with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment obesity is associated with HR B-ALL among males and Hispanics, as well as with CNS involvement, suggesting common physiology between obesity and leukemogenesis. An association between underweight and ALL was confirmed, likely due to cancer-associated wasting. These results have important public health implications for obesity prevention and treatment in children and adolescents to reduce cancer risk.","['Ghosh, Taumoha', 'Richardson, Michaela', 'Gordon, Peter M', 'Ryder, Justin R', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Turcotte, Lucie M']","['Ghosh T', 'Richardson M', 'Gordon PM', 'Ryder JR', 'Spector LG', 'Turcotte LM']","['Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Center for Pediatric Obesity Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', '*Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nutrition Surveys', 'Pediatric Obesity/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Thinness/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood ALL', '*obesity', '*risk factors']",2020/07/25 06:00,2021/07/21 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3334 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2020 Sep;9(18):6825-6835. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3334.

However, the expression patterns and the precise roles of the S100 family members contributing to tumorigenesis and the progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain to be elucidated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, the expression of S100 transcripts was analyzed in various tumor types in comparison to the normal controls using the ONCOMINE database, along with the corresponding expression profiles in the different subtypes of AML as retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We used the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database to investigate the prognostic values of S100 mRNA expression in AML. RESULTS: Our results indicated that high expression of S100A4 mRNA was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (p=0.026), while that of S100P was correlated with a favorable OS in AML patients (p=0.028). Other members of the S100 family did not show any correlation to the survival. Moreover, the correlation between the expression levels of S100A4 and S100P and the clinical characteristics and methylation of AML patients was investigated. The results demonstrated that the promoter methylation level of S100A4 (p=0.002) and S100P (p=0.029) was higher in 61-80-years-old group as compared to the other age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, it can be deduced that S100A4 and S100P might be novel biomarkers and crucial prognostic factors for AML.","['Yang, X-Y', 'Jin, J', 'Huang, J', 'Li, P', 'Xue, J-W', 'Wu, X-J', 'He, Z-X']","['Yang XY', 'Jin J', 'Huang J', 'Li P', 'Xue JW', 'Wu XJ', 'He ZX']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China. hzx@gmc.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (S100 Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Methylation', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'S100 Proteins/*genetics', '*Transcriptome', 'Young Adult']",,,2020/07/25 06:00,2021/04/30 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_202007_21896 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2020 Jul;24(13):7324-7334. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_202007_21896.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, miRNAs impact on nearly every physiological process and have also been associated with cancer. Prominent examples of such miRNAs can be found in the miR-15 family, composed of the bicistronic clusters miR-15a/16-1, miR-15b/16-2, and miR-497/195. In particular, the miR-15a/16-1 cluster is deleted in almost two thirds of all chronic B lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases, a phenotype that is also recapitulated by miR-15a/16-1-deficient as well as miR-15b/16-2-deficient mice. Under physiological conditions, those two clusters have been implicated in T-cell function, and B-cell and natural killer (NK) cell development; however, it is unclear whether miR-497 and miR-195 confer similar roles in health and disease. Here, we have generated a conditional mouse model for tissue-specific deletion of miR-497 and miR-195. While mice lacking miR-15a/16-1 in the hematopoietic compartment developed clear signs of CLL over time, aging mice deficient for miR-497/195 did not show such a phenotype. Likewise, loss of miR-15a/16-1 impaired NK and early B-cell development, whereas miR-497/195 was dispensable for these processes. In fact, a detailed analysis of miR-497/195-deficient mice did not reveal any effect on steady-state hematopoiesis or immune cell function. Unexpectedly, even whole-body deletion of the cluster was well-tolerated and had no obvious impact on embryonic development or healthy life span. Therefore, we postulate that the miR-497/195 cluster is redundant to its paralog clusters or that its functional relevance is restricted to certain physiological and pathological conditions.","['Hutter, Katharina', 'Rulicke, Thomas', 'Drach, Mathias', 'Andersen, Lill', 'Villunger, Andreas', 'Herzog, Sebastian']","['Hutter K', 'Rulicke T', 'Drach M', 'Andersen L', 'Villunger A', 'Herzog S']","['Institute of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Allergology, Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Laboratory Animal Science, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (MIRN195 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn15a microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Mirn16 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (mirn497 microRNA, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Editing/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*immunology', 'Homeostasis/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/immunology', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Cell Analysis/methods', 'Spleen/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*hematopoiesis', '*leukemia', '*miR-15', '*miR-195', '*miR-497']",2020/07/25 06:00,2021/07/21 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/febs.15493 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2021 Mar;288(5):1533-1545. doi: 10.1111/febs.15493.

Marker chromosome (MC) is a fragmented chromosome whose origin cannot be identified from other chromosomes and originates from marked genomic instability. Although AML with MC (MC+) has a poor prognosis even after intensive chemotherapy, its influence on the outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is unclear. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 162 AML patients after allo-HSCT. To evaluate the significance of MC, we compared it with other chromosomal abnormalities. RESULT: Marker chromosome was detected in 14 (8.6%, MC+) patients (vs MC-, n = 158). The 2-year overall survival (OS) in MC+ vs MC- was 26.8% vs 62.2% (P = .0098). The 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) in MC+ vs MC- was 80.4% vs 35.5% (P = .0004). Among adverse-risk AML (AD-AML, n = 36), AD-AML/MC+ (n = 11) demonstrated a poorer 2-year OS (9.1%, vs AD-AML/MC- n = 25, 58.3%, P = .0031) and higher 2-year CIR (89.6%, vs AD-AML/MC- 44.7%, P = .002). In multivariate analysis, MC (HR 3.08, 95% CI; 1.02-9.29, P = .046) and HCT-CI (HR 3.23, 95% CI; 1.00-10.4, P = .049) were independent risk factors for CIR among AD-AML. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests MC as a new independent factor for chromosome risk classification to further classify AD-AML.","['Fuse, Kyoko', 'Tanaka, Tomoyuki', 'Shibasaki, Yasuhiko', 'Furukawa, Tatsuo', 'Narita, Miwako', 'Sone, Hirohito', 'Masuko, Masayoshi']","['Fuse K', 'Tanaka T', 'Shibasaki Y', 'Furukawa T', 'Narita M', 'Sone H', 'Masuko M']","['Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine Graduate School of Medical and Dental Science, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine Graduate School of Medical and Dental Science, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagaoka Red Cross Hospital, Nagaoka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine Graduate School of Medical and Dental Science, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomic Instability', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'clinical trials', 'transplantation']",2020/07/25 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13495 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 Nov;105(5):616-625. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13495.

HAM/TSP is an inflammatory disease of the spinal cord and clinically characterized by progressive spastic paraparesis, urinary incontinence, and mild sensory disturbance. The interaction between the host immune response and HTLV-1-infected cells regulates the development of HAM/TSP. HTLV-1 preferentially infects CD4(+) T cells and is maintained by proliferation of the infected T cells. HTLV-1-infected cells rarely express viral antigens in vivo; however, they easily express the antigens after short-term culture. Therefore, such virus-expressing cells may lead to activation and expansion of antigen-specific T cell responses. Infected T cells with HTLV-1 and HTLV-1-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes invade the central nervous system and produce various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to neuronal damage and degeneration. Therefore, cellular immune responses to HTLV-1 have been considered to play important roles in disease development of HAM/TSP. Recent studies have clarified the viral strategy for persistence in the host through genetic and epigenetic changes by HTLV-1 and host immune responses including T cell function and differentiation. Newly developed animal models could provide the opportunity to uncover the precise pathogenesis and development of clinically effective treatment. Several molecular target drugs are undergoing clinical trials with promising efficacy. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the immunopathogenesis of HAM/TSP and discuss the perspectives of the research on this disease.","['Nozuma, Satoshi', 'Kubota, Ryuji', 'Jacobson, Steven']","['Nozuma S', 'Kubota R', 'Jacobson S']","['Viral Immunology Section, Division of Neuroimmunology and Neurovirology, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Division of Neuroimmunology, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Division of Neuroimmunology and Neurovirology, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. jacobsons@ninds.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/virology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Neurons/drug effects/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Neuroprotective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Spinal Cord/drug effects/immunology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology/virology', 'Urinary Incontinence/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology/virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HAM/TSP', '*HTLV-1', '*Immunology', '*Neurological disorders', '*Pathogenesis']",2020/07/25 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13365-020-00881-w [doi]', '10.1007/s13365-020-00881-w [pii]']",ppublish,J Neurovirol. 2020 Oct;26(5):652-663. doi: 10.1007/s13365-020-00881-w.

The present study analyzed the role and mechanisms of action of SNHG16 in leukemia cells in order to identify therapeutic targets for this disease. Reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) was performed to determine SNHG16 expression in human leukemia cell lines. Using TargetScan 7.2 and dualluciferase reporter assay, the target genes of SNHG16 were verified. Following the downregulation of the expression of SNHG16 or its target genes, Cell Counting kit8 (CCK8) assay was performed to examine the viability of the leukemia cells. In addition, flow cytometry was performed to analyze the cell apoptotic rates, and colony formation assays were used to determine the cell proliferative ability. RTqPCR and western blot analysis were used to determine the association between SNHG16 and its target genes. SNHG16 was found to be abnormally highly expressed in acute myeloblastic leukemia cell lines, the knockdown of which weakened the viability of the leukemia cells, suppressed cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. miR193a5p could bind to SNHG16, and its target gene was CDK8. Moreover, the expression of miR193a5p increased with the decrease in SNHG16 expression, while the inhibition of miR193a5p promoted the expression of CDK8. The downregulation of miR193a5p enhanced the viability of the leukemia cells, accelerated cell cloning and reduced cell apoptosis, which was completely opposite to the effects observed with the silencing of CDK8. The knockdown of SNHG16 suppressed the viability of the leukemia cells, suppressed cell proliferation, and induced cell apoptosis by regulating miR193a5p/CDK8. Thus, SNHG16 may prove to be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of leukemia.","['Piao, Meihua', 'Zhang, Li']","['Piao M', 'Zhang L']","['Clinical Laboratory, Yanbian University Hospital (Yanbian Hospital), Yanji, Jilin 133000, P.R.

The synthetic glucocorticoid (GC) dexamethasone (Dex) is commonly used to treat ALL, the main drawback of which is the development of resistance to this treatment. The aim of the present study was to investigate potential molecular circuits mediating resistance and sensitivity to GCinduced apoptosis in ALL. The leukaemia cell lines CEMC714, CEMC115 and MOLT4 treated with chloroquine (CLQ), thapsigargin (TG) and rotenone (ROT) were used to explore the roles of autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the response to GC treatment. ROS levels were associated with increased cell death and mitochondrial membrane potential in rotenonetreated CEM cells. Autophagy inhibition by CLQ exhibited the strongest cytotoxic effect in GCresistant leukaemia. Autophagy may act as a prosurvival mechanism in GCresistant leukaemia since increasing trends in beclin1 and microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3alpha levels were detected in CEMC115 and MOLT4 cells treated with Dex, whereas decreasing trends in these autophagy markers were observed in CEMC714 cells. The intracellular protein levels of the ER stress markers glucoseregulated protein (GRP)78 and GRP94 were stimulated by Dex only in the GCsensitive cells, suggesting a role of these chaperones in the GCmediated ALL cell death. Increased cell surface levels of GRP94 were recorded in CEMC714 cells treated with combination of Dex with TG compared with those in cells treated with TG alone, whereas decreasing trends were observed in CEMC115 cells under these conditions. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated that autophagy may be a prosurvival mechanism in GCresistant leukaemia, and by modulating intracellular and surface GRP94 protein levels, Dex is involved in the regulation of ER stress/UPRdependent cell death and immune surveillance. These observations may be of clinical importance if confirmed in patients.","['Sudsaward, Sangkab', 'Khunchai, Sasiprapa', 'Thepmalee, Chutamas', 'Othman, Aisha', 'Limjindaporn, Thawornchai', 'Yenchitsomanus, Pa-Thai', 'Mutti, Luciano', 'Krstic-Demonacos, Marija', 'Demonacos, Constantinos']","['Sudsaward S', 'Khunchai S', 'Thepmalee C', 'Othman A', 'Limjindaporn T', 'Yenchitsomanus PT', 'Mutti L', 'Krstic-Demonacos M', 'Demonacos C']","['School of Science, Engineering and Environment, University of Salford, Salford, M5 4WT, UK.', 'Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medical Science, Naresuan University, Phitsanulok 65000, Thailand.', 'Division of Biochemistry, School of Medical Science, University of Phayao, Phayao, 56000, Thailand.', 'School of Science, Engineering and Environment, University of Salford, Salford, M5 4WT, UK.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Research, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Research, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand.', 'Sbarro Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Center for Biotechnology, College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19122, USA.', 'School of Science, Engineering and Environment, University of Salford, Salford, M5 4WT, UK.', 'Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, School of Health Science, Division of Pharmacy and Optometry, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (endoplasmin)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Autophagy/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*immunology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects/immunology', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance/drug effects', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Rotenone/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*autophagy', '*endoplasmic reticulum stress', '*glucocorticoids', '*unfolded protein response']",2020/07/25 06:00,2021/05/27 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2020.5089 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2020 Sep;57(3):835-844. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2020.5089.

Methods: Using the population-based California Cancer Registry linked with California hospitalization data, we evaluated late effects in 1069 AYAs (aged 15-39 years) diagnosed with ALL in California between 1995 and 2012 and surviving a minimum of 3 years from diagnosis. Results: The estimated 10-year cumulative incidence of subsequent endocrine disease (28.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 25.8% to 31.6%) and cardiac disease (17.0%, 95% CI = 14.6% to 19.5%) were strikingly high; avascular necrosis (9.6%, 95% CI = 7.8% to 11.6%), liver disease (6.5%, 95% CI = 5.0% to 8.3%), respiratory disease (6.2%, 95% CI = 4.8% to 8.0%), seizure and/or stroke (4.3%, 95% CI = 3.1% to 5.8%), renal disease (3.1%, 95% CI = 2.1% to 4.4%), and second neoplasms (1.4%, 95% CI = 0.7% to 2.4%) were estimated to occur at 10 years with the reported frequencies. Multivariable analyses including the entire patient cohort demonstrated that public or no insurance (vs private and/or military insurance) and receipt of hematopoietic cell transplantation were independently associated with the occurrence of all late effects considered. In multivariable analyses limited to the 766 AYAs who were not transplanted, we continued to find a statistically significant association between public and no insurance and the occurrence of all late effects. Frontline regimen type (pediatric vs adult) was not statistically significantly associated with any of the late effect categories. Conclusions: This large population-based analysis is among the first to describe late effects in survivors of AYA ALL. The strong association between insurance type and late effects suggests that AYAs with public or no insurance may have reduced access to survivorship care following completion of ALL therapy.","['Muffly, Lori', 'Maguire, Frances B', 'Li, Qian', 'Kennedy, Vanessa', 'Keegan, Theresa H']","['Muffly L', 'Maguire FB', 'Li Q', 'Kennedy V', 'Keegan TH']","['Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'California Cancer Reporting and Epidemiologic Surveillance Program, University of California Davis Health, Institute for Population Health Improvement, Sacramento, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training (COHORT), University of California, Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Center for Oncology Hematology Outcomes Research and Training (COHORT), University of California, Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,JNCI Cancer Spectr,JNCI cancer spectrum,101721827,,,,,,2020/07/25 06:00,2020/07/25 06:01,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/jncics/pkaa025 [doi]', 'pkaa025 [pii]']",epublish,JNCI Cancer Spectr. 2020 Apr 2;4(4):pkaa025. doi: 10.1093/jncics/pkaa025. eCollection 2020 Aug.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-9887-6136', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8490-6229', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8071-4016']",20200402,,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

The dataset presented herein facilitates the study of the IgE-FcepsilonRI receptor signaling complex (IgE-RC) in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells coming into contact with a supported lipid bilayer with 25 mol% N-dinitrophenyl-aminocaproyl phosphatidylethanolamine, modeling an immunological synapse. TIRF microscopy was used to image IgE-RCs within this FcepsilonRI-centric synapse by loading RBL-2H3 cells with fluorescent anti-dinitrophenyl (anti-DNP) immunoglobulin E (IgE) in suspension for 24 h. Fluorescent anti-DNP IgE (IgE488) concentrations of this suspension increased from 10% to 100% and corresponding non-fluorescent anti-DNP IgE concentrations decreased from 90% to 0%. After the removal of unbound anti-DNP IgE, multiple image sequences were taken for each of these ten conditions. Prior to imaging, anti-DNP IgE-primed RBL-2H3 cells were either kept for a few minutes, for about 30 min, or for about one hour in Hanks buffer. The dataset contains 482 RBL-2H3 model synapse image stacks, dark images to correct for background intensity, and TIRF illumination profile images to correct for non-uniform TIRF illumination. After background subtraction, non-uniform illumination correction, and conversion of pixel units from analog-to-digital units to photo electrons, the average pixel intensity was calculated. The average pixel intensity within FcepsilonRI-centric synapses for all three Hanks buffer conditions increased linearly at a rate of 0.42 +/- 0.02 photo electrons per pixel per % IgE488 in suspension. RBL-2H3 cell degranulation was tested by detecting beta-hexosaminidase activity. Prolonged RBL-2H3 cell exposure to Hanks buffer inhibited exocytosis in RBL-2H3 cells.","['Drawbond, Rachel', 'Spendier, Kathrin']","['Drawbond R', 'Spendier K']","['UCCS Center of the Biofrontiers Institute, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, CO 80918, USA.', 'Department of Mathematics, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, CO 80918, USA.', 'Department of Mathematics, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, CO 80918, USA.', 'Department of Physics and Energy Science, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, CO 80918, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Data (Basel),Data,101699766,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FcepsilonRI', 'IgE receptor', 'RBL-2H3', 'TIRF', 'plasma membrane', 'rat basophilic leukemia cells', 'supported lipid bilayer', 'total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy']",2020/07/25 06:00,2020/07/25 06:01,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/25 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3390/data4030111 [doi]'],ppublish,Data (Basel). 2019 Sep;4(3). doi: 10.3390/data4030111.

Infectious agents especially viruses have been considered as role players in the development of breast cancer. Although some investigations suggest an association between bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and breast cancer, the involvement of this virus as a risk factor remains controversial. The present study aimed to find out any possible association between BLV and breast cancer through conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Systematic literature search was performed by finding related case-control articles from the PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE databases. The heterogeneity and the multivariable-adjusted OR and corresponding 95% CI were applied by meta-analysis and forest plot across studies. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14.1. Result: Based on a comprehensive literature search, 9 case-control studies were included for meta-analysis. The combination of all included studies showed that BLV infection is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer [summary OR (95% CI) 2.57 (1.45, 4.56)]. Conclusion: This is the first meta-analysis to analyze a potential association between BLV infection and the risk of breast cancer. Control of the infection in cattle herds and screening of the milk and dairy products may help to reduce the transmission of the virus to humans.","['Khatami, Alireza', 'Pormohammad, Ali', 'Farzi, Rana', 'Saadati, Hassan', 'Mehrabi, Maryam', 'Kiani, Seyed Jalal', 'Ghorbani, Saied']","['Khatami A', 'Pormohammad A', 'Farzi R', 'Saadati H', 'Mehrabi M', 'Kiani SJ', 'Ghorbani S']","['Department of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran.grid.411746.10000 0004 4911 7066', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB Canada.grid.22072.350000 0004 1936 7697', 'Department of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Science, Shiraz, Iran.grid.412571.40000 0000 8819 4698', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.grid.411746.10000 0004 4911 7066', 'Department of Microbiology, Karaj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Karaj, Iran.grid.411769.c0000 0004 1756 1701', 'Department of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran.grid.411746.10000 0004 4911 7066', 'Department of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran.grid.411746.10000 0004 4911 7066', 'Student Research Committee, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.grid.411746.10000 0004 4911 7066']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Infect Agent Cancer,Infectious agents and cancer,101276559,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BLV', 'Bovine leukemia virus', 'Breast cancer', 'Meta-analysis']",2020/07/25 06:00,2020/07/25 06:01,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13027-020-00314-7 [doi]', '314 [pii]']",epublish,Infect Agent Cancer. 2020 Jul 22;15:48. doi: 10.1186/s13027-020-00314-7. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9284-6983'],20200722,,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,PMC7374970,,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of and risk factors for SPM in CLL patients receiving BTKi are not yet characterized. We retrospectively determined the incidence of SPM in CLL patients treated with ibrutinib or acalabrutinib at our institution between 2009 and 2017, assessed for association between baseline characteristics and SPM incidence, and compared the observed to expected cancer incidence among age, sex, and year matched controls without CLL. After a median of 44 months follow-up, 64/691 patients (9%) were diagnosed with SPM (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer [NMSC]). The 3-year cumulative incidence rate was 16% for NMSC and 7% for other SPM. On multivariable analysis, smoking was associated with increased SPM risk (HR 2.8 [95% CI: 1.6-4.8]) and higher baseline CD8 count was associated with lower SPM risk (HR 0.9 for 2-fold increase [95% CI: 0.8-0.9]). The observed over expected rate of SPM was 2.2 [95% CI: 1.7-2.9].

However, since the tumorigenic potential of undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is a major safety concern for clinical transplantation, inducible Caspase-9 (iC9) is under consideration for use as a fail-safe system. Here, we used targeted gene editing to introduce the iC9 system into human iPSCs, and then interrogated the efficiency of inducible apoptosis with normal iPSCs as well as diseased iPSCs derived from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML-iPSCs). The iC9 system induced quick and efficient apoptosis to iPSCs in vitro.

In this article, we employ text mining and word cloud analysis techniques to address these challenges. The proposed framework extracts the variant-gene-disease associations from the full-length biomedical literature and designs an evidence-based variant-driven gene panel for a given condition. We validate the identified genes by showing their diagnostic abilities to predict the patients' clinical outcome on several independent validation cohorts. As representative examples, we present our results for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), breast cancer and prostate cancer. We compare these panels with other variant-driven gene panels obtained from Clinvar, Mastermind and others from literature, as well as with a panel identified with a classical differentially expressed genes (DEGs) approach. The results show that the panels obtained by the proposed framework yield better results than the other gene panels currently available in the literature.","['Saberian, Nafiseh', 'Shafi, Adib', 'Peyvandipour, Azam', 'Draghici, Sorin']","['Saberian N', 'Shafi A', 'Peyvandipour A', 'Draghici S']","['Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA.

However, how fusion transcripts exporting remains to be declared. Here, we showed that the nuclear speckle-specific long noncoding RNA MALAT1 controls chimeric mRNA export processes and regulates myeloid progenitor cell differentiation in malignant hematopoiesis. We demonstrated that MALAT1 regulates chimeric mRNAs export in an m6A-dependent manner and thus controls hematopoietic cell differentiation. Specifically, reducing MALAT1 or m6A methyltransferases and the 'reader' YTHDC1 result in the universal retention of distinct oncogenic gene mRNAs in nucleus. Mechanically, MALAT1 hijacks both the chimeric mRNAs and fusion proteins in nuclear speckles during chromosomal translocations and mediates the colocalization of oncogenic fusion proteins with METTL14. MALAT1 and fusion protein complexes serve as a functional loading bridge for the interaction of chimeric mRNA and METTL14. This study demonstrated a universal mechanism of chimeric mRNA transport that involves lncRNA-fusion protein-m6A autoregulatory loop for controlling myeloid cell differentiation. Targeting the lncRNA-triggered autoregulatory loop to disrupt chimeric mRNA transport might represent a new common paradigm for treating blood malignancies.","['Chen, Zhen-Hua', 'Chen, Tian-Qi', 'Zeng, Zhan-Cheng', 'Wang, Dan', 'Han, Cai', 'Sun, Yu-Meng', 'Huang, Wei', 'Sun, Lin-Yu', 'Fang, Ke', 'Chen, Yue-Qin', 'Luo, Xue-Qun', 'Wang, Wen-Tao']","['Chen ZH', 'Chen TQ', 'Zeng ZC', 'Wang D', 'Han C', 'Sun YM', 'Huang W', 'Sun LY', 'Fang K', 'Chen YQ', 'Luo XQ', 'Wang WT']","['MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275, Guangzhou, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, 510060, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275, Guangzhou, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, 510080, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 510275, Guangzhou, China. wangwt8@mail.sysu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (MALAT1 long non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SRSF3 protein, human)', '0 (YTHDC1 protein, human)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)', 'CLE6G00625 (N-methyladenosine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (METTL14 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Biological', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing Factors/metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/metabolism']",,,2020/07/25 06:00,2021/03/26 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-02795-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-02795-1 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Jul 23;11(7):566. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-02795-1.,,20200723,,,,PMC7378249,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with FLT3-mutated AML frequently present with critical illness, are more likely to relapse after treatment, and have worse clinical outcomes than their FLT3 wild type counterparts. The clinical management of FLT3-mutated AML has been transformed by the development of FLT3 inhibitors, which are now in use in the frontline and relapsed/refractory settings. However, many questions regarding the optimal approach to the treatment of these patients remain. In this paper, we will review the rationale for targeting the FLT3 receptor in AML, the impact of FLT3 mutation on patient prognosis, the current standard of care approaches to FLT3-mutated AML management, and the diverse array of FLT3 inhibitors in use and under investigation. We will also explore new opportunities and strategies for targeting the FLT3 receptor. These include targeting the receptor in patients with non-canonical FLT3 mutations or wild type FLT3, pairing FLT3 inhibitors with other novel therapies, using minimal residual disease (MRD) testing to guide the targeting of FLT3, and novel immunotherapeutic approaches.","['Ambinder, Alexander J', 'Levis, Mark']","['Ambinder AJ', 'Levis M']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Review'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2020/07/25 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.240754 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.240754 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Mar 1;106(3):671-681. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.240754.,,20210301,,,,PMC7927884,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently found that activating a beta-catenin-independent branch of WNT signaling that inhibits GSK3-dependent protein degradation induces asparaginase sensitivity in drug-resistant leukemias. To test predictions from our model, we turned to colorectal cancer because these cancers can have WNT-activating mutations that function either upstream (i.e., R-spondin fusions) or downstream (APC or beta-catenin mutations) of GSK3, thus allowing WNT/beta-catenin and WNT-induced asparaginase sensitivity to be unlinked genetically. We found that asparaginase had little efficacy in APC or beta-catenin-mutant colorectal cancer, but was profoundly toxic in the setting of R-spondin fusions. Pharmacologic GSK3alpha inhibition was sufficient for asparaginase sensitization in APC or beta-catenin-mutant colorectal cancer, but not in normal intestinal progenitors. Our findings demonstrate that WNT-induced therapeutic vulnerabilities can be exploited for colorectal cancer therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: Solid tumors are thought to be asparaginase-resistant via de novo asparagine synthesis. In leukemia, GSK3alpha-dependent protein degradation, a catabolic amino acid source, mediates asparaginase resistance. We found that asparaginase is profoundly toxic to colorectal cancers with WNT-activating mutations that inhibit GSK3. Aberrant WNT activation can provide a therapeutic vulnerability in colorectal cancer.See related commentary by Davidsen and Sullivan, p. 1632.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1611.","['Hinze, Laura', 'Labrosse, Roxane', 'Degar, James', 'Han, Teng', 'Schatoff, Emma M', 'Schreek, Sabine', 'Karim, Salmaan', 'McGuckin, Connor', 'Sacher, Joshua R', 'Wagner, Florence', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Yuan, Chen', 'Sicinska, Ewa', 'Giannakis, Marios', 'Ng, Kimmie', 'Dow, Lukas E', 'Gutierrez, Alejandro']","['Hinze L', 'Labrosse R', 'Degar J', 'Han T', 'Schatoff EM', 'Schreek S', 'Karim S', 'McGuckin C', 'Sacher JR', 'Wagner F', 'Stanulla M', 'Yuan C', 'Sicinska E', 'Giannakis M', 'Ng K', 'Dow LE', 'Gutierrez A']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.', 'Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.', 'Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.', 'Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.', 'Weill Cornell/Rockefeller/Sloan-Kettering Tri-Institutional MD-PhD program, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Oncologic Pathology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.', 'Departments of Medicine and Biochemistry, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts. alejandro.gutierrez@childrens.harvard.edu."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Discov,Cancer discovery,101561693,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],IM,"['Asparaginase/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*genetics']",,,2020/07/25 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['2159-8290.CD-19-1472 [pii]', '10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-1472 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Discov. 2020 Nov;10(11):1690-1705. doi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-19-1472.

When HHTR occurs, mainly in patients with hemoglobinopathy, complement activation up to membrane attack complex (MAC) is strongly suspected. However, our knowledge of HHTR in patients without hemoglobinopathy is limited. In the present study, we retrospectively reviewed patients with the diagnosis of HHTR who were attended at our hospital between 2013 and 2016. We also performed a literature search to identify other reported cases of HHTR. Finally, the role of terminal complement pathway activation in the pathogenesis of HHTR was assessed by exposing endothelial cells in vitro to activated-patient plasma to analyze C5b-9 deposits by immunofluorescence. HHTR was diagnosed in 3 patients according to current criteria. Patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulins (alone or in conjunction with rituximab and plasma exchange), and all of them recovered successfully. We retrieved from literature search 10 patients without hemoglobinopathy who developed HHTR. A marked increase of C5b-9 (MAC) deposition on endothelial cells (almost 2.5-fold increase versus control, P < .05) was observed with the plasma sample obtained from one of our patients. In conclusion, HHTR was a rare transfusion reaction that occurred in patients without hemoglobinopathy. We add more evidence that complement cascade activation up to MAC might play a role in the pathogenesis of HHTR.","['Cid, Joan', 'Fernandez, Javier', 'Palomo, Marta', 'Blasco, Miquel', 'Bailo, Noemi', 'Diaz-Ricart, Maribel', 'Lozano, Miquel']","['Cid J', 'Fernandez J', 'Palomo M', 'Blasco M', 'Bailo N', 'Diaz-Ricart M', 'Lozano M']","[""Apheresis & Cellular Therapy Unit, Department of Hemotherapy and Hemostasis, ICMHO, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.

Here, we show that DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 8 (DCAF8), which can form a functional E3 ligase complex (CRL4(DCAF8)), has a strong interaction with the MLF2 protein. DCAF8 could promote MLF2 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In contrast, ubiquitin specific peptidase 11 (USP11) associates with MLF2, thereby increasing its stability. Since MLF1 is highly related to MLF2, we demonstrated that MLF1 also interacts with DCAF8 and USP11, suggesting that CRL4(DCAF8) and USP11 may also regulate the expression of MLF1. TCGA analysis revealed that both the myeloid leukemia factors (MLF1 and MLF2) show significant differential expression in various tumors. The results of our study indicate that CRL4(DCAF8) and USP11 play opposite roles in the regulation of MLF1 and MLF2, which may, in turn, affect their biological functions in various cancers.","['Huang, Daoyuan', 'Liu, Cheng', 'Sun, Xiwen', 'Sun, Xinpei', 'Qu, Yanan', 'Tang, Yunyi', 'Li, Guodong', 'Tong, Tanjun']","['Huang D', 'Liu C', 'Sun X', 'Sun X', 'Qu Y', 'Tang Y', 'Li G', 'Tong T']","['Peking University Research Center on Aging, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Research Center on Aging, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Research Center on Aging, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Research Center on Aging, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Research Center on Aging, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Research Center on Aging, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Research Center on Aging, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.', 'Peking University Research Center on Aging, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, 100191, China.

In this study, we defined a novel miRNA, hsa-miR-12462, through small RNA sequencing of the bone marrow (BM) cells from 128 AML patients. Overexpression of hsa-miR-12462 in AML cells (U937 and HL-60) significantly decreased their growth rate when compared with those of the wild-type and MOCK controls. In a xenograft mouse model, tumor weight and size in the mice bearing the U937 cells with hsa-miR-12462 overexpression were significantly reduced when compared with those bearing the mock cells. The AML cells overexpressing hsa-miR-12462 had increased sensitivity to cytarabine chemotherapy. Combining the data from the MiRDB, an online microRNA database ( http://mirdb.org ), with the RNA-sequencing results, SLC9A1 was predicted to be one of the targets of hsa-miR-12462. hsa-miR-12462 was further confirmed to bind exclusively to the 3'UTR of SLC9A1 in U937 cells, leading to downregulation of SLC9A1. In summary, a higher level of hsa-miR-12462 in AML cells is associated with increased sensitivity to cytarabine chemotherapy via downregulation of SLC9A1.","['Jia, Yan', 'Liu, Wei', 'Zhan, Hui-En', 'Yi, Xiao-Ping', 'Liang, Hui', 'Zheng, Qi-Li', 'Jiang, Xin-Ya', 'Zhou, Hai-Yan', 'Zhao, Liang', 'Zhao, Xie-Lan', 'Zeng, Hui']","['Jia Y', 'Liu W', 'Zhan HE', 'Yi XP', 'Liang H', 'Zheng QL', 'Jiang XY', 'Zhou HY', 'Zhao L', 'Zhao XL', 'Zeng H']","['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Radiology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. androps2011@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (SLC9A1 protein, human)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 1)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*RNA sequencing', '*SLC9A1', '*miRNA']",2020/07/25 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2020/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-020-00935-w [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-020-00935-w [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2020 Jul 23;13(1):101. doi: 10.1186/s13045-020-00935-w.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4498-8888'],20200723,,,,PMC7376648,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism underlying this resistance is incompletely understood. METHODS: DLD1 cells with WT (+/-) or KRAS G13D mutant allele were treated with different concentrations of Cetuximab (Cet) or panitumumab (Pab) to study the mechanism underlying the KRAS mutation-induced resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies. The function of AMPK in KRAS mutation-induced resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies in CRC cells, and the regulatory role of Bcl-2 family proteins in DLD1 cells with WT or mutated KRAS upon AMPK activation were investigated. In addition, xenograft tumor models with the nude mouse using DLD1 cells with WT or mutated KRAS were established to examine the effects of AMPK activation on KRAS mutation-mediated anti-EGFR antibody resistance. RESULTS: Higher levels of AMPK activity in CRC cells with wild-type KRAS treated with anti-EGFR antibody resulted in apoptosis induction. In contrast, CRC cells with mutated KRAS showed lower AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and decreased sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of anti-EGFR antibody. CRC cells with mutated KRAS showed high levels of glycolysis and produced an excessive amount of ATP, which suppressed AMPK activation. The knockdown of AMPK expression in CRC cells with WT KRAS produced similar effects to those observed in cells with mutated KRAS and decreased their sensitivity to cetuximab. On the contrary, the activation of AMPK by metformin (Met) or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) could overcome the KRAS-induced resistance to the anti-EGFR antibody in vivo and in vitro. The activation of AMPK resulted in the inhibition of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) translation through the suppression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. CONCLUSION: The results established herein indicate that targeting AMPK is a potentially promising and effective CRC treatment strategy.

The mixed form of bIFIs is a rare phenomenon but could be potentially a troublesome challenge when caused by azole-resistant strains or non-Aspergillus fumigatus. To raise awareness and emphasize diagnostic challenges, we present a case of mixed bIFIs in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A newly diagnosed 18-month-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was complicated with prolonged severe neutropenia after induction chemotherapy. He experienced repeated episodes of fever due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli bloodstream infection and pulmonary invasive fungal infection with Aspergillus fumigatus (early-type bIFIs) while receiving antifungal prophylaxis. Shortly after pulmonary involvement, his condition aggravated by abnormal focal movement, loss of consciousness and seizure. Cerebral aspergillosis with Aspergillus niger diagnosed after brain tissue biopsy. The patient finally died despite 108-day antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed bIFIs is a rare condition with high morbidity and mortality in the patients receiving immunosuppressants for hematological malignancies. This case highlights the clinical importance of Aspergillus identification at the species level in invasive fungal infections with multiple site involvement in the patients on antifungal prophylaxis.","['Amanati, Ali', 'Lotfi, Mehrzad', 'Masoudi, Mohammad Sadegh', 'Jafarian, Hadis', 'Ghasemi, Fatemeh', 'Bozorgi, Haleh', 'Badiee, Parisa']","['Amanati A', 'Lotfi M', 'Masoudi MS', 'Jafarian H', 'Ghasemi F', 'Bozorgi H', 'Badiee P']","['Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Namazi Hospital, Zand Ave, Shiraz, 7193711351, Iran.', 'Medical Imaging Research Center, Department of Radiology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Namazi Hospital, Zand Ave, Shiraz, 7193711351, Iran.', 'Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Namazi Hospital, Zand Ave, Shiraz, 7193711351, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Namazi Hospital, Zand Ave, Shiraz, 7193711351, Iran. badieep@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antigens, Fungal)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Fungal/analysis', 'Aspergillus fumigatus/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Aspergillus niger/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Cerebellum/microbiology/pathology', 'Child', 'Coinfection/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/blood/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Male', 'Neuroaspergillosis/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['Aspergillus fumigatus', 'Aspergillus niger', 'Brain abscess', 'Breakthrough invasive fungal infections']",2020/07/25 06:00,2020/08/22 06:00,['2020/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-020-05162-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-020-05162-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2020 Jul 23;20(1):535. doi: 10.1186/s12879-020-05162-9.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4221-2995'],20200723,,,,PMC7376672,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeting the spindle separation phase of mitosis has gained much attention pharmaceutically in cancer chemotherapy. Spindle segregation is carried out mainly by Eg5 kinesin, and currently, it has many inhibitors in different phases of clinical trials. All the current drug candidates bind un-competitively with ATP/ADP at allosteric site 1 (formed by loop L5, helix alpha2 and helix alpha3). Recent experiments show that inhibitors that bind to the site 2 (formed by helix alpha4 and helix alpha6) are either competitive or uncompetitive to ATP/ADP. OBJECTIVES: To identify suitable lead compounds that target the mitotic kinesin Eg5, using in silico screening and their validation using in vitro and cell-based assays. METHODOLOGY: Potential inhibitors were screened for human Eg5 (kinesin-5) through structurebased virtual screening and the top-scoring compounds were validated using steady-state ATPase assay, differential scanning fluorimetry, and microscale thermophoresis. The anti-cancer activity of the compounds was evaluated in the epithelial (A549) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562) cancer cell lines. A known strong binding inhibitor, S-trityl-L-cystine, is used as a reference compound. RESULTS: Out of the many compounds tested, MM01 and MM03 showed good cell-based activity against the cancer cell lines A549 and K562 and can be further studied in animal models.

Children with DS are more likely to develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). For the management of pediatric ALL, different treatment protocols have been set up since years. However, ALL children with coexisting DS have shown to have increased therapy-related toxicities compared to those without DS. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to systematically analyze the treatment outcomes in acute ALL children with versus without coexisting DS. METHODS: Electronic databases including the Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google scholar were searched for publications reporting treatment related outcomes in ALL children with versus without co-existing DS. Several treatment protocols were used accordingly. This study had a long-term follow-up time period ranging from 5 to 10 years. The RevMan 5.3 software was used to carry out this analysis. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to represent the results post analysis. RESULTS: A total number of 31,476 children with ALL enrolled between the years 1981 and 2011 were included. Among the total number of children with ALL, 1303 had coexisting DS. Our results showed that event-free survival was similar in ALL children with versus without DS (odds ratio [OR]: 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.51-3.50; P = .55). Overall mortality (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 0.86-3.10; P = .13) and participants who achieved clinical remission (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.12-9.29; P = .97) were also similarly manifested. However, treatment-related mortality (OR: 4.29, 95% CI: 2.90-6.36; P = .00001) and induction failure (OR: 2.77, 95% CI: 1.08-7.07; P = .03) were significantly higher in the DS group. Also, total (OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.02-1.88; P = .04) and bone marrow relapses (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.00-1.67; P = .05) were significantly higher in ALL children with DS. Nevertheless, central nervous system relapse (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.60-2.20; P = .67), testicular relapse (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.38-1.85; P = .87), and other relapses (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.27-4.62; P = .88) were not significantly different when these outcomes were separately analyzed. CONCLUSION: Based on this analysis of the treatment outcomes in ALL children with versus without DS, event-free survival, overall mortality, and patients who achieved clinical remission were similar during this long-term follow-up time period. However, due to the significantly higher treatment-related mortality, induction failure, and certain relapses in ALL children with DS, new guidelines might have to focus on reconsidering or modifying treatment regimens for ALL children with DS.","['Liao, Wenjun', 'Liu, Ying']","['Liao W', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Neonatology.', ""Department of Oncology, Jingmen No.1 People's Hospital, Jingmen, Hubei, P.R.

The LD50 after a single intraperitoneal injection in mice was determined to be 2162 mg/kg, but after intravenous bolus administration of 500 mg/kg or in chronic toxicity tests with daily intraperitoneal injections, neurological side effects were observed. Antitumor activity was determined in therapy experiments in CD2F1 mice bearing subcutaneously transplanted P388 mouse leukemia cells.

In this frame, the use of Blinatumomab may induce durable remissions, serving as a successful bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Herein, we retrospectively summarize the Greek experience on pediatric relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor ALL patients that were treated with Blinatumomab in a compassionate, off-label setting as an effort to achieve disease clearance and proceed to allo-HSCT. In our cohort of 9 patients, 6/9 (66.7%) responded to Blinatumomab, achieving complete morphological remission (CR) after the 1st cycle, while minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD)-negativity (<10-4) after the 1st cycle was achieved in 2/2 patients (100.0%) with prior CR. A successful bridge to HSCT was feasible in 5/9 patients (55.6%). Median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 3.0 months (range 0.5-21.4 months) and median overall survival (OS) was 8.7 months (range 1.4-47.1 months) for the whole pediatric cohort. There was a trend of prolonged survival among patients who achieved MRD response after the 1st Blinatumomab administration. MRD response (defined as the >=2-log reduction of MRD value before and after Blinatumomab administration), was associated with a median RFS/OS of 7.4/7.6 months, while lack of MRD response was associated with a median RFS/OS of 0.5/3.0 months, respectively. Novel therapeutic maneuvers, in order to overcome disease resistance, i.e. increased usage of Blinatumomab dose (45 mug/m2/day), combination with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs), use of other immunotherapy salvage approaches (inotuzumabozogamicin), are herein discussed. Additionally, the optimal number of Blinatumomab cycles, the CD19-negative relapses and lineage switch, are also addressed. Our data although referred to a limited, however refractory or relapsed and heavily pretreated number of patients, strongly suggest that Blinatumomab may well induce sustained remissions and serve as an effective bridge to HSCT. Whether immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy can outweigh the need for subsequent allo-HSCT, if incorporated into frontline high-risk ALL therapy, remains an optimistic issue to be verified in future randomized clinical trials.","['Ampatzidou, M', 'Kattamis, A', 'Baka, M', 'Paterakis, G', 'Anastasiou, T', 'Tzanoudaki, M', 'Kaisari, A', 'Avgerinou, G', 'Doganis, D', 'Papadakis, V', 'Kitra, V', 'Polychronopoulou, S']","['Ampatzidou M', 'Kattamis A', 'Baka M', 'Paterakis G', 'Anastasiou T', 'Tzanoudaki M', 'Kaisari A', 'Avgerinou G', 'Doganis D', 'Papadakis V', 'Kitra V', 'Polychronopoulou S']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece."", ""First Department of Pediatrics, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece."", ""Oncology Department, P. and A.

Zinc finger Ebox binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2)antisense RNA 1 (AS1) has been verified to participate in the progression of several types of cancer, including AML. However, the potential mechanisms of ZEB2AS1 in AML have not yet been fully elucidated. The present study aimed to elucidate the role and regulatory mechanisms of ZEB2AS1 in AML. The expression of ZEB2AS1, microRNA1225p (miRNA/miR1225p) and pololike kinase 1 (PLK1) was detected by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) in AML tissues or cells. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and apoptosis assay, respectively. The protein levels were examined by western blot analysis. The targeted sequence between miR1225p and ZEB2AS1 or PLK1 was predicted using an online database and verified by dualluciferase reporter assay. A mouse tumor xenograft model was established to confirm the effects of ZEB2AS1 on tumor growth in vivo. The results revealed that the expression levels of ZEB2AS1 and PLK1 were upregulated, while those of miR1225p were downregulated in AML tissues and cells. The knockdown of ZEB2AS1 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. By experimental verification, ZEB2AS1 was found to negatively regulate miR1225p expression and PLK1 was found to be a target gene of miR1225p. Furthermore, ZEB2AS1 was verified to regulate the expression of PLK1 by sponging miR1225p in AML cells. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that ZEB2AS1 promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, at least partly by targeting PLK1 mediated by miR1225p in AML cells.","['Guan, Jianmin', 'Liu, Ping', 'Wang, Aixia', 'Wang, Bo']","['Guan J', 'Liu P', 'Wang A', 'Wang B']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Heze Medical College, Heze, Shandong 274000, P.R.

It may present either as a chronic disorder with mild symptoms and low disease burden for several years, thereby justifying a watch-and-wait-strategy, or may soon progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) leaving allogeneic stem cell transplantation as the only curative treatment option. AREAS COVERED: Attempts have been made to integrate clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular parameters into scoring systems aiming at providing reliable prognostic information. In this article, we discuss several prognostic parameters and validate prognostic scores in a cohort of 645 patients with CMML. EXPERT OPINION: We show that the CPSS (CMML prognostic scoring system) is a useful prognostic tool.

Venetoclax has demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy in patients with previously treated CLL and has been evaluated in combination with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on the activity and toxicity of the time-limited combination of venetoclax plus rituximab for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL, presenting clinical trial results and data from correlative studies, with the aim of highlighting the strengths of this treatment approach and discuss weaknesses and possible areas of improvement. Data from PubMed indexed papers as well as from abstracts presented at major international conferences are included. EXPERT OPINION: Deep responses with venetoclax-based regimens have been shown to allow time-limited treatment and prolonged remission off-therapy in patients with CLL. The clinical benefit of venetoclax and rituximab over chemo-immunotherapy has been demonstrated in recurrent CLL. Potential advantages of time-limited treatment approaches include avoidance of long-term toxicities, high drug costs, and the selection of resistant subclones.","['Vitale, Candida', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra']","['Vitale C', 'Ferrajoli A']","['University Division of Hematology, A.O.U.

Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor gamma (PTPRG) expression is a natural inhibitory mechanism that is downregulated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) disease. The mechanism behind its downregulation has not been fully elucidated yet. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the CpG methylation status at the PTPRG locus in CML patients. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from CML patients at time of diagnosis [no tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)] (n = 13), failure to (TKIs) treatment (n = 13) and healthy controls (n = 6) were collected. DNA was extracted and treated with bisulfite treatment, followed by PCR, sequencing of 25 CpG sites in the promoter region and 26 CpG sites in intron-1 region of PTPRG. The bisulfite sequencing technique was employed as a high-resolution method. RESULTS: CML groups (new diagnosed and failed treatment) showed significantly higher methylation levels in the promoter and intron-1 regions of PTPRG compared to the healthy group. There were also significant differences in methylation levels of CpG sites in the promoter and intron-1 regions amongst the groups. CONCLUSION: Aberrant methylation of PTPRG is potentially one of the possible mechanisms of PTPRG downregulation detected in CML.","['Ismail, Mohamed A', 'Samara, Muthanna', 'Al Sayab, Ali', 'Alsharshani, Mohamed', 'Yassin, Mohamed A', 'Varadharaj, Govindarajulu', 'Vezzalini, Marzia', 'Tomasello, Luisa', 'Monne, Maria', 'Morsi, Hisham', 'Qoronfleh, M Walid', 'Zayed, Hatem', 'Cook, Richard', 'Sorio, Claudio', 'Modjtahedi, Helmout', 'Al-Dewik, Nader I']","['Ismail MA', 'Samara M', 'Al Sayab A', 'Alsharshani M', 'Yassin MA', 'Varadharaj G', 'Vezzalini M', 'Tomasello L', 'Monne M', 'Morsi H', 'Qoronfleh MW', 'Zayed H', 'Cook R', 'Sorio C', 'Modjtahedi H', 'Al-Dewik NI']","['School of Life Science, Pharmacy and Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Engineering & ComputingFaculty of Science, Engineering & Computing, Kingston University London, Kingston-Upon-Thames, UK.', 'Interim Translational Research Institute (iTRI), Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Psychology, Kingston University London, Kingston upon Thames, London, UK.', 'Interim Translational Research Institute (iTRI), Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'Diagnostic Genetics Division (DGD), Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology (DLMP), Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Centre for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'Genetrics Inc, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.', 'General Pathology Division, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Wexner Medical Center, Biomedical Research Tower, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Centro di Diagnostica Biomolecolare e Citogenetica Emato-Oncologica, San Francesco"" Hospital, Nuoro, Italy.', 'Quality of Life unit, National Center for Cancer Care and Research, (NCCCR), Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'World Innovation Summit for Healthcare (WISH), Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Biomedical Research Center, College of Health Sciences, QU Health, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.', 'School of Life Science, Pharmacy and Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Engineering & ComputingFaculty of Science, Engineering & Computing, Kingston University London, Kingston-Upon-Thames, UK.', 'General Pathology Division, Department of Medicine, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'School of Life Science, Pharmacy and Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Engineering & ComputingFaculty of Science, Engineering & Computing, Kingston University London, Kingston-Upon-Thames, UK.', 'School of Life Science, Pharmacy and Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Engineering & ComputingFaculty of Science, Engineering & Computing, Kingston University London, Kingston-Upon-Thames, UK.', 'Qatar Medical Genetic Center (QMGC), Hamad General Hospital (HGH), and Interim Translational Research Institute (iTRI), Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'College of Health and Life Science (CHLS), Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU), Doha, Qatar.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Women's Wellness and Research Center (WWRC), HMC, Doha, Qatar.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Genet Genomic Med,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,101603758,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRG protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 5)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 5/blood/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*PTPRG', '*Qatar', '*aberrant DNA', '*cancer', '*epigenetics', '*methylation']",2020/07/24 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2020/07/24 06:00'],"['2020/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mgg3.1319 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Genet Genomic Med. 2020 Oct;8(10):e1319. doi: 10.1002/mgg3.1319.

Due to an overlap of symptoms, it can be difficult to separate disease versus treatment-related effects. Study objectives were to understand the impact of factors that might influence patients' HRQoL, assess the degree of concordance in symptom reporting by patients and physicians, and assess the impact of any discordance on HRQoL in AML patients. METHODS: Physicians in the USA captured demographics, current AML treatment and symptoms for 82 AML patients who completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Leukemia (FACT-Leu), 5-Dimension EuroQol Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) and Cancer Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ). Effect size (ES) and clinically meaningful differences between AML subgroups were assessed, as was the impact of disagreement between patients and physicians regarding symptom recognition. RESULTS: Clinically meaningful lower overall FACT-Leu scores were observed for: relapsed/refractory versus non-relapsed/refractory AML patients (92.5 vs. 103.7; P = 0.09; ES = 0.439), hypomethylating agent (HMA) monotherapy versus other therapies in patients with low treatment intensity (89.9 vs. 112.9; P = 0.0021; ES = 0.971) and presence/absence of FLT3-ITD mutation (85.5 vs. 100; P = 0.148; ES = 0.816). Differences in health state were also clinically meaningful between patients with/without FLT3-ITD; EQ-5D-Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (47.6 vs. 63.7; P = 0.0428; ES = 0.816). Patients were more likely than physicians to report bruising (kappa = 0.1292), fatigue (kappa = 0.0836), bleeding (kappa = 0.0177), weight loss (kappa = 0.0821) and appetite loss (kappa = - 0.0246). FACT-Leu was associated with patient-physician discordance on bleeding (difference - 14.12; P = 0.046), weight loss (- 21.22; P = 0.001) and appetite loss (- 12.58; P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL is generally low for AML patients, especially for particular subgroups. Discordance in symptom reporting between patients and physicians was common and associated with further negative impacts on HRQoL. There may be many reasons for this but better communication between physicians and patients may lead to shared objectives and improvement in patients' HRQoL.

Because patients with APL present a tendency for severe bleeding, often resulting in an early fatal course, APL was historically considered to be one of the most fatal forms of acute leukemia. However, therapeutic advances, including anthracycline- and cytarabine-based chemotherapy, have significantly improved the outcomes of APL patients. Due to the further introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and-more recently-the development of arsenic trioxide (ATO)-containing regimens, APL is currently the most curable form of AML in adults. Treatment with these new agents has introduced the concept of cure through targeted therapy. With the advent of revolutionary ATRA-ATO combination therapies, chemotherapy can now be safely omitted from the treatment of low-risk APL patients. In this article, we review the six-decade history of APL, from its initial characterization to the era of chemotherapy-free ATRA-ATO, a model of cancer-targeted therapy.","['Thomas, Xavier']",['Thomas X'],"['Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud University Hospital, Pierre Benite, France.

The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has led to marked improvements in responses and overall survival; however, there is still a subset of patients that are either resistant through a multitude of mechanisms or intolerant to standard TKI therapy. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (omacetaxine), a semisynthetic purified homoharringtonine compound, has been studied for over 40 years and was approved in 2012 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with CML refractory or intolerant to two or more TKIs. Omacetaxine has a novel mechanism of action-inhibition of protein synthesis, which does not overlap with kinase inhibition. Multiple studies have demonstrated that omacetaxine can achieve responses in heavily treated patients with either chronic-phase or accelerated-phase CML, regardless of the presence of mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain.

After 40 years during which the standard of care for patients evolved very little, the therapeutic landscape has recently seen rapid changes, with the approval of eight new drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the last 2 years, providing new opportunities, as well as new challenges, for treating clinicians. These therapies include FLT3 inhibitors midostaurin and gilteritinib, CPX-351 (liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicin), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO, anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody conjugated with calicheamicin), IDH1/IDH2 inhibitors ivosidenib and enasidenib, Hedgehog inhibitor glasdegib, and BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax. In this review, we summarize currently available data on these new drugs and discuss the rapidly evolving therapeutic armamentarium for AML, focusing on targeted therapies.","['Fiorentini, Alessandro', 'Capelli, Debora', 'Saraceni, Francesco', 'Menotti, Diego', 'Poloni, Antonella', 'Olivieri, Attilio']","['Fiorentini A', 'Capelli D', 'Saraceni F', 'Menotti D', 'Poloni A', 'Olivieri A']","['Hematology Department and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ospedali Riuniti di Ancona, Ancona, Italy.', 'Hematology Department and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ospedali Riuniti di Ancona, Ancona, Italy.', 'Hematology Department and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ospedali Riuniti di Ancona, Ancona, Italy.', 'Hematology Department and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ospedali Riuniti di Ancona, Ancona, Italy.', 'Hematology Department and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ospedali Riuniti di Ancona, Ancona, Italy.', 'Hematology Department and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ospedali Riuniti di Ancona, Ancona, Italy. a.olivieri@staff.univpm.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Oncol Ther,Oncology and therapy,101677510,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Enasidenib', 'Gemtuzumab ozogamicin', 'Genetoclax', 'Gilteritinib', 'Glasdegib', 'Ivosidenib', 'Midostaurin', 'Targeted therapy']",2020/07/24 06:00,2020/07/24 06:01,['2020/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s40487-019-00108-x [doi]', '10.1007/s40487-019-00108-x [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Ther. 2020 Jun;8(1):13-32. doi: 10.1007/s40487-019-00108-x.

METHODS: This was a phase 1, open-label study. Six subjects who met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. After an overnight fast of at least 10 h, the subjects received an oral dose (coated tablet) of 100 mg of AG-221 at 0 h on dosing day. Four hours after the oral dose, the subjects received 100 mug AG-221 containing ~ 300 nCi of [(14)C]-AG-221 administered as an IV bolus. Blood samples were collected and analyzed for plasma concentrations of AG-221 and [(14)C]-AG-221 using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation followed by accelerator mass spectrometry analysis (AMS), respectively. Safety was evaluated throughout the study. RESULTS: The absolute BA after a 100-mg oral dose of AG-221 was measured as 57.2%. While the total clearance was 1.37 L/h, ~ 1/60 of the liver blood flow in a typical 70-kg human subject, the first-pass extraction was estimated to be less than 2%, assuming that the total clearance was entirely due to liver metabolism. Thus, the fraction of the AG-221 dose absorbed was at least 50%. AG-221 was safe and well tolerated when given under fasted conditions in a single 100-mg dose as a coated tablet with a microtracer [(14)C]-AG-221 solution, as few drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported. No clinically significant changes or findings were noted in the clinical laboratory evaluations, vital sign measurements, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) performed during this study. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy subjects under fasting conditions, the absolute BA following oral administration of a 100-mg AG-221 tablet was 57.2%. AG-221 was safe and well tolerated in healthy male subjects when administered as a single 100-mg film-coated tablet plus 100 microg [(14)C]-AG-221 given intravenously.

METHODS: This was a retrospective study in which the characteristics of stem cell mobilization treated with a G-CSF alone were compared in 216 patients and 56 donors. The two G-CSF compared were NEU and the biosimilar filgrastim Zarzio(R) (Sandoz GmbH) (referred to hereafter as BIO). Primary objectives were mobilization rate (minimum of 10 x 10(3)/ml CD34+ on day 4 of treatment [day +4]) and use of the immunostimulant plerixafor (PLEX) in each group. RESULTS: The general characteristics of the patients receiving NEU (n = 138) and those receiving BIO (n = 78) did not differ significantly. PLEX was used in 24% of BIO patients and in 25.7% of NEU patients. The median CD34+ cell count on day +4 was significantly lower in BIO patients who needed PLEX than in those who did not (2.4 vs. 4.8 x 10(3)/ml; p = 0.002), as was the final CD34+ cell count (2.5 vs. 3.3 x 10(6)/kg; p 0.03). Mobilization failure rate was higher in the BIO group than in the NEU group (20 vs. 0%; p = 0.01). With respect to donors, more than one apheresis was needed in three BIO donors, one of them with PLEX. The use of BIO was the only risk factor for mobilization failure in patients who needed PLEX (hazard ratio 10.3; 95% confidence interval 1.3-77.8). CONCLUSION: The study revealed that BIO had a lower efficacy for stem cell mobilization when the only treatment was G-CSF, especially in poor mobilizers needing PLEX.","['Parody, Rocio', 'Sanchez-Ortega, Isabel', 'Ferra, Christelle', 'Guardia, Ramon', 'Talarn, Carme', 'Encuentra, Maite', 'Fort, Eduard', 'Lopez, David', 'Morgades, Mireia', 'Alonso, Eva', 'Ortega, Sandra', 'Sarra, Josep', 'Gallardo, David', 'Ribera, Josep M', 'Sureda, Anna']","['Parody R', 'Sanchez-Ortega I', 'Ferra C', 'Guardia R', 'Talarn C', 'Encuentra M', 'Fort E', 'Lopez D', 'Morgades M', 'Alonso E', 'Ortega S', 'Sarra J', 'Gallardo D', 'Ribera JM', 'Sureda A']","[""Clinical Hematology Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, L'Hospitalet, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain. rparody@iconcologia.net."", ""Clinical Hematology Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, L'Hospitalet, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hematology Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Badalona, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias I Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute,, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hospital Universitari Josep Trueta, Girona, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.', ""Clinical Hematology Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, L'Hospitalet, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain."", ""Institut Catala d'Oncologia, L'Hospitalet, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Pharmacy Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, L'Hospitalet, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Pharmacy Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, L'Hospitalet, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hematology Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Badalona, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias I Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute,, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Institut Catala d'Oncologia, L'Hospitalet, IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Banc de Sang I Teixits de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Banc de Sang I Teixits de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitari Josep Trueta, Girona, Spain.', ""Hematology Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Badalona, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias I Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute,, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Clinical Hematology Department, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, L'Hospitalet, Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Oncol Ther,Oncology and therapy,101677510,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Biosimilars', 'Plerixafor', 'Stem cell mobilization']",2020/07/24 06:00,2020/07/24 06:01,['2020/07/24 06:00'],"['2020/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:01 [medline]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40487-020-00115-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s40487-020-00115-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Ther. 2020 Dec;8(2):311-324. doi: 10.1007/s40487-020-00115-3.

The diagnosis requires a high grade of suspicion due to the large variety of presenting symptoms. The World Health Organization classification recognizes localized (cutaneous) and systemic forms of the disease, with these forms showing different degrees of aggressiveness. Mastocytosis is often a multiorgan disease, and its correct management requires a multidisciplinary team of experienced consultants to provide overall patient care. Bone marrow evaluation by molecular analyses, skeleton X-ray and abdominal scan together with allergologic and dermatologic evaluation constitute the essential diagnostic work-up for adult patients with mastocytosis. As clinical situations vary, treatment options range from the use of drugs to treat the symptoms, such as anti-H1 receptors and steroids, to UV irradiation, which is overwhelmingly used in patients with cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) or indolent systemic mastocytosis, to cytoreductive treatment to control life-threatening symptoms or organ damage in the more aggressive forms of the disease. Prognosis also widely differs among patients diagnosed with mastocytosis, with the spectrum ranging from an almost normal life expectancy for those with CM and to less than 1-year median overall survival for those with mast cell leukemia.","['Criscuolo, Marianna', 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Maraglino, Alessio M E', 'Pagano, Livio']","['Criscuolo M', 'Fianchi L', 'Maraglino AME', 'Pagano L']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Radiologiche Radioterapiche ed Ematologiche, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

Imatinib, the first BCR-ABL1 TKI, was introduced into clinical practice in the early 2000s. In the following years, the so-called second-generation TKIs (2GTKIs)-dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib were approved, initially for patients resistant to imatinib, and subsequently for front-line treatment. With multiple TKIs available, selection of first-line therapy is challenging. CML risk, patient characteristics and potential toxicities of different TKIs play a fundamental role, in particular when deciding between imatinib and 2GTKIs as frontline treatment. So, when deciding front-line therapy for a patient with CML in the chronic phase (CML-CP), clinicians must consider both the long-term outcomes, such as overall survival and progression-free survival, as well as safety, tolerance and possible treatment discontinuation. This paper offers a practical algorithmic approach for the sequential use of commercially available TKIs in patients with CML-CP along with the data available in the literature.","['Tiribelli, Mario', 'Eskazan, Ahmet Emre']","['Tiribelli M', 'Eskazan AE']","['Division of Hematology and BMT, Department of Medical Area, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey. emreeskazan@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Editorial'],New Zealand,Oncol Ther,Oncology and therapy,101677510,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bosutinib', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Dasatinib', 'Imatinib', 'Ponatinib', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2020/07/24 06:00,2020/07/24 06:01,['2020/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s40487-019-00098-w [doi]', '10.1007/s40487-019-00098-w [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Ther. 2019 Dec;7(2):95-100. doi: 10.1007/s40487-019-00098-w.

To our knowledge, FAP and AML occurring in the same patient were reported only once in the literature. In our patient and the previously reported case, it is assumed that FAP occurred first and AML developed later; no family history of FAP was noted in either patient.

Identification of the predictors of poor clearance during HDMTX infusions could advance the introduction of improved supportive care to prevent toxicities and reduce hospital length of stay. The purpose of this study was to identify relationships between patient physical characteristics and HDMTX clearance in the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). At our hospital, patients who have delayed methotrexate (MTX) clearance during a cycle of HDMTX receive an increased rate of hydration with subsequent cycles. This increase in hydration rate was examined for its potential to mitigate predictors of poor clearance and to prevent nephrotoxicity. Methods This study retrospectively examined the treatment records of 87 pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL who were treated on or according to Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols AALL0232, AALL0434, AALL1131, and AALL1231. Each patient received four cycles of HDMTX (5 g/m(2) over 24 hours) at two-week intervals. Patients received either 125 ml/m(2)/hour (standard) or 200 ml/m(2)/hour (delayed clearance protocol) hydration before, with, and after each infusion. MTX levels taken at 24-, 42-, and 48-hour time points were used as an indirect measure of drug clearance. Two-tailed inference for ordinary least squares regression and both heteroskedastic and paired two-tailed t-tests were performed to identify physical characteristics associated with delayed MTX clearance and the effects of hydration rate on MTX clearance, respectively. Results Patient age and body surface area (BSA) were found to have statistically significant (p<0.05) positive associations with the serum MTX levels at 24, 42, and 48 hours in cycle 1. Age and BSA were significant only at the 24-hour time point in cycles 2 and 4. Weight alone was not associated with delayed MTX clearance. For patients who had delayed MTX clearance once and thus received the delayed clearance protocol in subsequent cycles, increasing the hydration rate from 125 to 200 ml/m(2)/hour was associated with a statistically significant decrease in average MTX levels as well as serum creatinine levels at the 24-, 42-, and 48-hour time points. Once patients with delayed clearance received the 200 ml/m(2)/hour rate of hydration, the history of prior poor clearance lost its predictive value for serum MTX levels and delayed clearance. Conclusions These results suggest that patient age and BSA are significant predictors of MTX clearance if all patients receive the same rate of hydration. Age and BSA affect the distribution phase of MTX kinetics, with downstream effects in the elimination phase. Increased hydration mitigates the effects of these physical characteristics on the elimination phase kinetics by improving renal elimination of MTX, causing a loss of significance of age and BSA as predictors of MTX levels in subsequent cycles at the 42- and 48-hour time points, but with less effect at 24 hours. Thus, hyperhydration regimens prior to cycle 1 of HDMTX could be considered for patients presenting with risk factors of advanced age or high BSA to avoid delayed clearance.","['Chen, Aaron R', 'Wang, YunZu M', 'Lin, Mark', 'Kuo, Dennis J']","['Chen AR', 'Wang YM', 'Lin M', 'Kuo DJ']","['Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, San Diego, USA.', ""Bone Marrow Transplant and Immune Deficiency, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, USA."", ""Department of Pharmacy, University of California San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital, Oakland, USA."", 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of California San Diego, San Diego, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'methotrexate', 'pharmacology']",2020/07/24 06:00,2020/07/24 06:01,['2020/07/24 06:00'],"['2020/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.8674 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 Jun 17;12(6):e8674. doi: 10.7759/cureus.8674.,,20200617,,"['Copyright (c) 2020, Chen et al.']","['U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7370657,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we analyse 1,148 patient-derived B-cell leukaemia (B-ALL) samples, and find that individual mutations do not promote leukaemogenesis unless they converge on one single oncogenic pathway that is characteristic of the differentiation stage of transformed B cells. Mutations that are not aligned with this central oncogenic driver activate divergent pathways and subvert transformation. Oncogenic lesions in B-ALL frequently mimic signalling through cytokine receptors at the pro-B-cell stage (via activation of the signal-transduction protein STAT5)(2-4) or pre-B-cell receptors in more mature cells (via activation of the protein kinase ERK)(5-8). STAT5- and ERK-activating lesions are found frequently, but occur together in only around 3% of cases (P = 2.2 x 10(-16)). Single-cell mutation and phospho-protein analyses reveal the segregation of oncogenic STAT5 and ERK activation to competing clones. STAT5 and ERK engage opposing biochemical and transcriptional programs that are orchestrated by the transcription factors MYC and BCL6, respectively. Genetic reactivation of the divergent (suppressed) pathway comes at the expense of the principal oncogenic driver and reverses transformation. Conversely, deletion of divergent pathway components accelerates leukaemogenesis. Thus, persistence of divergent signalling pathways represents a powerful barrier to transformation, while convergence on one principal driver defines a central event in leukaemia initiation. Pharmacological reactivation of suppressed divergent circuits synergizes strongly with inhibition of the principal oncogenic driver. Hence, reactivation of divergent pathways can be leveraged as a previously unrecognized strategy to enhance treatment responses.","['Chan, Lai N', 'Murakami, Mark A', 'Robinson, Mark E', 'Caeser,

Human gammadelta T cells recognize and kill transformed cells independently of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction, which is an essential feature of conventional alphabeta T cells. Vgamma9Vdelta2 gammadelta T cells, which prevail in the peripheral blood of healthy adults, are activated by microbial or endogenous tumor-derived pyrophosphates by a mechanism dependent on butyrophilin molecules. gammadelta T cells expressing other T cell receptor variable genes, notably Vdelta1, are more abundant in mucosal tissue. In addition to the T cell receptor, gammadelta T cells usually express activating natural killer (NK) receptors, such as NKp30, NKp44, or NKG2D which binds to stress-inducible surface molecules that are absent on healthy cells but are frequently expressed on malignant cells. Therefore, gammadelta T cells are endowed with at least two independent recognition systems to sense tumor cells and to initiate anticancer effector mechanisms, including cytokine production and cytotoxicity. In view of their HLA-independent potent antitumor activity, there has been increasing interest in translating the unique potential of gammadelta T cells into innovative cellular cancer immunotherapies. Here, we discuss recent developments to enhance the efficacy of gammadelta T cell-based immunotherapy. This includes strategies for in vivo activation and tumor-targeting of gammadelta T cells, the optimization of in vitro expansion protocols, and the development of gene-modified gammadelta T cells. It is equally important to consider potential synergisms with other therapeutic strategies, notably checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, or the (local) activation of innate immunity.","['Kabelitz, Dieter', 'Serrano, Ruben', 'Kouakanou, Leonce', 'Peters, Christian', 'Kalyan, Shirin']","['Kabelitz D', 'Serrano R', 'Kouakanou L', 'Peters C', 'Kalyan S']","['Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, D-24105, Kiel, Germany. dietrich.kabelitz@uksh.de.', 'Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, D-24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, D-24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, D-24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, V6T 1Z4, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",China,Cell Mol Immunol,Cellular & molecular immunology,101242872,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Adoptive T cell transfer', '*Antibody constructs', '*Cytokines', '*Immunotherapy', '*Leukemia', '*Lymphoma', '*Solid tumors', '*gamma/delta T cells']",2020/07/24 06:00,2021/10/07 06:00,['2020/07/24 06:00'],"['2020/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41423-020-0504-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41423-020-0504-x [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Immunol. 2020 Sep;17(9):925-939. doi: 10.1038/s41423-020-0504-x.

In this context, the combination strategy may be a promising approach to overcome this barrier. Here, we report the preclinical efficacy of a novel strategy combining ABT-199 with triptolide (TPL), a natural product extracted from a traditional Chinese medicine, in AML. Combination treatment exhibited markedly increased cytotoxicity in leukemic cells irrespective of p53 status while largely sparing normal cells of the hematopoietic lineage. Moreover, co-administration of ABT-199 with TPL dramatically suppressed leukemia progression as well as prolonged animal survival in a xenograft AML model. The potentiated effect of ABT-199 and TPL against AML was associated with activation of the mitochondrum-related intrinsic apoptotic pathway through a mechanism reciprocally modulating Bcl-2 family proteins. In this case, TPL not only downregulated Mcl-1 but also upregulated proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, thereby overcoming the resistance toward ABT-199. Conversely, ABT-199 abrogated Bcl-2-mediated cytoprotection against TPL. Together, these findings suggest that the regimen combining TPL and ABT-199 might be active against AML by inducing robust apoptosis through reciprocal regulation of anti- and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, therefore providing a strong rationale for the clinical investigation of this combination regimen for the treatment of AML.","['Shi, Yuan-Fei', 'Liu, Long', 'He, Ling-Li', 'Ye, Jing', 'Lin, Zhi-Juan', 'Yuan, De-Lin', 'Deng, Man-Man', 'Fang, Zhi-Hong', 'Carter, Bing Z', 'Xu, Bing']","['Shi YF', 'Liu L', 'He LL', 'Ye J', 'Lin ZJ', 'Yuan DL', 'Deng MM', 'Fang ZH', 'Carter BZ', 'Xu B']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Xiamen Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Therapy for Hematological Malignancies, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Xiamen Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Therapy for Hematological Malignancies, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Zhuzhou Hospital, Xiang Ya Medical College, Central South University, Zhuzhou, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Xiamen Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Therapy for Hematological Malignancies, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Xiamen Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Therapy for Hematological Malignancies, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Xiamen Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Therapy for Hematological Malignancies, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Xiamen Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Therapy for Hematological Malignancies, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China. jeho_fang@126.com.', 'Xiamen Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Therapy for Hematological Malignancies, Xiamen, Fujian, China. jeho_fang@126.com.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. bicarter@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology, Medical College of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China. xubingzhangjian@126.com.', 'Xiamen Key Laboratory of Diagnosis and Therapy for Hematological Malignancies, Xiamen, Fujian, China. xubingzhangjian@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phenanthrenes/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2020/07/24 06:00,2021/03/25 06:00,['2020/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-02762-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-02762-w [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Jul 22;11(7):555. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-02762-w.,,20200722,,,,PMC7376040,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined cell viability, DNA damage and DNA repair kinetics. We also studied the effect of both compounds on DNA oxidative damage, free radical level and HO-1 gene expression. We showed that at low concentrations both CORM-2 and iCORM-2 stimulate PBMCs viability. After 24-h incubation, CORM-2 and iCORM-2, at the concentration of 100 microM, reduce the viability of both PBMCs and HL-60 cells. We also demonstrated that CORM-2 and iCORM-2, in the 0.01-100 microM concentration range, cause DNA damage such as strand breaks and alkaline labile sites. DNA damage was repaired efficiently only in HL-60 cells. CORM-2 significantly reduces oxidative stress induced by 1 mM H2O2 in normal and cancer cells. On the contrary, iCORM-2 in HL-60 cells increases the level of free radicals in the presence of 1 and 5 mM H2O2. We also revealed that both CORM-2 and iCORM-2 induce HO-1 gene expression. However, CORM-2 induces this gene to a greater extent than iCORM-2, especially in HL-60 cells at 100 microM. Finally, we showed that CORM-2 and iCORM-2 reduce H2O2-induced DNA oxidative damage. Furthermore, CORM-2 proved to be a compound with stronger antioxidant properties than iCORM-2. Our results suggest that both active CORM-2 and inactive iCORM-2 exert biological effects such as cyto- and genotoxicity, antioxidant properties and the ability to induce the HO-1 gene. The released CO as well as iCORM-2 can be responsible for these effects.","['Juszczak, Michal', 'Kluska, Magdalena', 'Wysokinski, Daniel', 'Wozniak, Katarzyna']","['Juszczak M', 'Kluska M', 'Wysokinski D', 'Wozniak K']","['Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236, Lodz, Poland.', 'Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236, Lodz, Poland.', 'Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236, Lodz, Poland.', 'Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236, Lodz, Poland. katarzyna.wozniak@biol.uni.lodz.pl.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer)', '7U1EE4V452 (Carbon Monoxide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*chemistry', 'Carbon Monoxide/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Organometallic Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,,2020/07/24 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/07/24 06:00'],"['2020/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-68948-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-68948-6 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jul 22;10(1):12200. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-68948-6.,,20200722,,,,PMC7376213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emerging studies have revealed the crucial role of MCL1 in the chemoresistance of cancer cells. The antiapoptotic function of MCL1 makes it a popular therapeutic target, although specific inhibitors have begun to emerge only recently. Notably, emerging studies have reported that several E3 ligases and deubiquitinases modulate MCL1 stability, providing an alternate means of targeting MCL1 activity. In addition, the emergence and development of proteolysis-targeting chimeras, the function of which is based on ubiquitination-mediated degradation, has shown great potential. In this review, we provide an overview of the studies investigating the ubiquitination and deubiquitination of MCL1, summarize the latest evidence regarding the development of therapeutic strategies targeting MCL1 in cancer treatment, and discuss the promising future of targeting MCL1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system in clinical practice.","['Wu, Xiaowei', 'Luo, Qingyu', 'Liu, Zhihua']","['Wu X', 'Luo Q', 'Liu Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 100021, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 100021, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 100021, Beijing, China. liuzh@cicams.ac.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', '*Ubiquitination']",,,2020/07/24 06:00,2021/03/25 06:00,['2020/07/24 06:00'],"['2020/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-02760-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-02760-y [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Jul 22;11(7):556. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-02760-y.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4176-7198', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4164-637X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4242-033X']",20200722,,,,PMC7376237,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study scrutinized the anti-proliferative activity of EAG on blood cancer-derived Jurkat leukemic cells. Cell viability assays in leukemic cancer cells determined that EAG possesses potent anti-proliferative effects. Moreover, treatment with EAG increased the proportion of apoptotic cells, resulted in cell cycle arrest being induced at the subG0/ G1 phase, and reduced the proportion of cells present in the S phase. In addition, mitochondrial membrane potential was reduced by EAG in Jurkat cells. Additionally, EAG triggered apoptosis that was mediated by the downregulation of BCL-XL, p-IkappaBalpha, and p-p65 expressions in addition to the upregulation of cleaved Caspase 3 and BAX expressions. These findings revealed that the toxic effect of EAG was mediated by intracellular signal transduction pathways that involved a mechanism in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) were upregulated. Thus, this study concludes that EAG could potentially serve as a therapeutic agent for leukemia.","['Lee, Beom Zoo', 'Lee, Ik Soo', 'Pham, Chau Ha', 'Jeong, Soon-Kyu', 'Lee, Sulhae', 'Hong, KwangWon', 'Yoo, Hee Min']","['Lee BZ', 'Lee IS', 'Pham CH', 'Jeong SK', 'Lee S', 'Hong K', 'Yoo HM']","['Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Dongguk University, Goyang 10326, Republic of Korea.', 'Chemland Co., Ltd., Gunpo IT Valley, Gunpo 15850, Republic of Korea.', 'Herbal Medicine Research Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon 34054, Republic of Korea.', 'Group for Biometrology, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Daejeon 34113, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, Chungnam National University (CNU), Daejeon 34134, Republic of Korea.', 'Chemland Co., Ltd., Gunpo IT Valley, Gunpo 15850, Republic of Korea.', 'Chemland Co., Ltd., Gunpo IT Valley, Gunpo 15850, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Food Science and Biotechnology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Dongguk University, Goyang 10326, Republic of Korea.', 'Group for Biometrology, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Daejeon 34113, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),J Microbiol Biotechnol,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,9431852,"['0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Umbelliferones)', 'A4VZ22K1WT (coumarin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'SM2XD6V944 (esculetin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coumarins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Fraxinus/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Plant Bark/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Umbelliferones/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Fraxinus rhynchophylla', 'ROS', 'apoptosis', 'coumarin', 'cytotoxicity', 'leukemia']",2020/07/24 06:00,2021/02/12 06:00,['2020/07/24 06:00'],"['2020/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['jmb.2006.06022 [pii]', '10.4014/jmb.2006.06022 [doi]']",ppublish,J Microbiol Biotechnol. 2020 Aug 28;30(8):1214-1221. doi: 10.4014/jmb.2006.06022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, ZIKV NS5 formed discrete punctate nuclear bodies (NBs), while DENV NS5 was uniformly dispersed in the nucleoplasm. Yet, mutating one DENV NS5 SUMO site (K546R) localized the NS5 mutant to discrete NBs, and NBs formed by the ZIKV NS5 SUMO mutant (K252R) were restructured into discrete protein complexes. In hBMECs, NBs formed by STAT2 and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein are present constitutively and enhance innate immunity. During ZIKV infection or NS5 expression, we found that ZIKV NS5 evicts PML from STAT2 NBs, forming NS5/STAT2 NBs that dramatically reduce PML expression in hBMECs and inhibit the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG). Expressing the ZIKV NS5 SUMO site mutant (K252R) resulted in NS5/STAT2/PML NBs that failed to degrade PML, reduce STAT2 expression, or inhibit ISG induction. Additionally, the K252 SUMOylation site and NS5 nuclear localization were required for ZIKV NS5 to regulate hBMEC cell cycle transcriptional responses. Our data reveal NS5 SUMO motifs as novel NB coordinating factors that distinguish flavivirus NS5 proteins. These findings establish SUMOylation of ZIKV NS5 as critical in the regulation of antiviral ISG and cell cycle responses that permit ZIKV to persistently infect hBMECs.IMPORTANCE ZIKV is a unique neurovirulent flavivirus that persistently infects human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs), the primary barrier that restricts viral access to neuronal compartments. Here, we demonstrate that flavivirus-specific SIM and SUMO sites determine the assembly of NS5 proteins into discrete nuclear bodies (NBs). We found that NS5 SIM sites are required for NS5 nuclear localization and that SUMO sites regulate NS5 NB complex constituents, assembly, and function. We reveal that ZIKV NS5 SUMO sites direct NS5 binding to STAT2, disrupt the formation of antiviral PML-STAT2 NBs, and direct PML degradation. ZIKV NS5 SUMO sites also transcriptionally regulate cell cycle and ISG responses that permit ZIKV to persistently infect hBMECs. Our findings demonstrate the function of SUMO sites in ZIKV NS5 NB formation and their importance in regulating nuclear responses that permit ZIKV to persistently infect hBMECs and thereby gain access to neurons.","['Conde, Jonas N', 'Schutt, William R', 'Mladinich, Megan', 'Sohn, Sook-Young', 'Hearing, Patrick', 'Mackow, Erich R']","['Conde JN', 'Schutt WR', 'Mladinich M', 'Sohn SY', 'Hearing P', 'Mackow ER']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA Erich.Mackow@stonybrook.edu.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (NS5 protein, flavivirus)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (STAT2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Viral Nonstructural Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exoribonucleases)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Brain/*metabolism/virology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism/virology', 'Exoribonucleases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/drug effects', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'STAT2 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sumoylation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Viral Nonstructural Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Zika Virus/*genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Zika Virus Infection/immunology/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*PML', '*SIM site', '*SUMO site', '*Zika virus', '*brain', '*endothelial cells', '*nuclear bodies', '*persistence', '*sumoylation']",2020/07/24 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/07/24 06:00'],"['2020/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01086-20 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01086-20 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2020 Sep 15;94(19). pii: JVI.01086-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01086-20.

Rare cases of invasive conidiobolomycosis due to C. coronatus or other species (C.incongruus, C.lamprauges) have been reported in immunocompromised patients. We report here the first case of invasive pulmonary fungal infection due to Conidiobolus pachyzygosporus in a Swiss patient with onco-haematologic malignancy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71 year-old female was admitted in a Swiss hospital for induction chemotherapy of acute myeloid leukemia. A chest CT performed during the neutropenic phase identified three well-circumscribed lung lesions consistent with invasive fungal infection, along with a positive 1,3-beta-d-glucan assay in serum. A transbronchial biopsy of the lung lesions revealed large occasionally septate hyphae. A Conidiobolus spp. was detected by direct 18S rDNA in the tissue biopsy and subsequently identified at species level as C. pachyzygosporus by 28S rDNA sequencing. The infection was cured after isavuconazole therapy, recovery of the immune system and surgical resection of lung lesions. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of C. pachyzygosporus as human pathogen and second case report of invasive conidiobolomycosis from a European country.","['Stavropoulou, E', 'Coste, A T', 'Beigelman-Aubry, C', 'Letovanec, I', 'Spertini, O', 'Lovis, A', 'Krueger, T', 'Burger, R', 'Bochud, P Y', 'Lamoth, F']","['Stavropoulou E', 'Coste AT', 'Beigelman-Aubry C', 'Letovanec I', 'Spertini O', 'Lovis A', 'Krueger T', 'Burger R', 'Bochud PY', 'Lamoth F']","['Infectious Diseases Service, Department of Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Microbiology, Department of Laboratories, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pathology, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Service and Central Laboratory of Hematology, Department of Oncology, Lausanne University hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Service of pneumology, Department of Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Thoracic Surgery Service, Department of Surgery and Anesthesiology, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Infectious Diseases Service, Department of Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Infectious Diseases Service, Department of Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Infectious Diseases Service, Department of Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.

METHODS: Proliferation, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis and TUNEL assays were conducted to detect the growth and apoptosis in MM cells. Western blotting was used to identify the change in the protein. RESULTS: In cell assays, PsA significantly inhibited the growth and apoptosis in MM cells. Cyclin B1, caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-3, PARP, cleaved-PARP, p-ERK increased, while Bcl-2 decreased after PSA treatment. The CD49e positive rate of U266 cells was increased after 96h PsA treatment. At the same time, immunoglobulin and the Free Light Chain (FLC) ratio in the culture supernatant obviously increased. Also, the differentiation induced by PsA was confirmed in the primary myeloma cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that PsA may exert its antitumor effect by causing G2 arrest and apoptosis in myeloma cells. And low-dose PsA can induce the differentiation of myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma cells, probably through the MEK/ERK signaling pathway in vitro.","['Ye, Bibo', 'Zhou, Yingying', 'Liu, Yanli', 'Li, Xuewei', 'Li, Tianyu', 'Qi, Xiaofei']","['Ye B', 'Zhou Y', 'Liu Y', 'Li X', 'Li T', 'Qi X']","['Leukemia Research Division, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of the Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Leukemia Research Division, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of the Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'College of Pharmacy, Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Leukemia Research Division, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of the Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Wu Xi, Wu Xi, Jiangsu, China."", 'Leukemia Research Division, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of the Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Saponins)', '4H15F0GLV2 (Pulsatilla saponin A)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Saponins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ERK signaling pathway', '*MEK', '*Pulsatilla saponin A (PsA)', '*apoptosis', '*differentiation', '*myeloma']",2020/07/24 06:00,2021/12/15 06:00,['2020/07/24 06:00'],"['2020/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-108375 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520620666200721125036 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2021;21(7):919-926. doi: 10.2174/1871520620666200721125036.,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Naphthoquinones are effectively quinones present in different plants, with demonstrated anticancer activities. A recent study conducted by our group demonstrated the antileukemic potential of two novel triazol-1,4- naphthoquinones derivatives, PTN (2-(4-Phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-1,4-naphthoquinone) and MPTN (2-[4- (4-Methoxyphenyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl]-1,4-naphthoquinone). Although, the mechanisms underlying the proapoptotic effects of PTN and MPTN have not been fully elucidated so far. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the proapoptotic mechanism of PTN and MPTN in human acute leukemia cells. METHODS: We used fluorescence microscopy to observe acridine orange and annexin V staining cells. Flow cytometry assay has also been used for ROS quantification, BAX and cytochrome c proteins expression and apoptosis analysis. MTT assay and western blotting technique have been performed as well for MAPK pathway analysis. RESULTS: By using the acridine orange and annexin V staining with fluorescence microscopy, we have characterized the proapoptotic effects of PTN and MPTN in HL-60 cells involving the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway, since these compounds promoted an increase in the intracellular BAX and cytochrome c protein levels (p<0.05). We further demonstrated that apoptosis induction in HL-60 cells was mediated by increasing intracellular ROS levels via ERK but not p38 MAPKs pathway. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results have demonstrated that PTN and MPTN are promising tools for the development of new anti-leukemic drugs.","['Coulidiati, Tangbadioa H', 'Dantas, Bruna B', 'Faheina-Martins, Glaucia V', 'de Morais Gomes, Eneas Ricardo', 'Goncalves, Juan C R', 'de Araujo, Demetrius A Machado']","['Coulidiati TH', 'Dantas BB', 'Faheina-Martins GV', 'de Morais Gomes ER', 'Goncalves JCR', 'de Araujo DAM']","['Department of Life and Earth Sciences, Research and Training Unit in Science and Technology, University Norbert Zongo of Koudougou, BP 376, Koudougou, Burkina Faso', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology, Department of Biotechnology, Federal University of Paraiba, 58051-900, Joao Pessoa-PB, Brazil', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology, Department of Biotechnology, Federal University of Paraiba, 58051-900, Joao Pessoa-PB, Brazil', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology, Department of Biotechnology, Federal University of Paraiba, 58051-900, Joao Pessoa-PB, Brazil', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology, Department of Biotechnology, Federal University of Paraiba, 58051-900, Joao Pessoa-PB, Brazil', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology, Department of Biotechnology, Federal University of Paraiba, 58051-900, Joao Pessoa-PB, Brazil', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Paraiba, 58051-900, Joao Pessoa-PB, Brazil', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biotechnology, Department of Biotechnology, Federal University of Paraiba, 58051-900, Joao Pessoa-PB, Brazil']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Molecular Structure', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*HL-60', '*acute leukemia', '*cytotoxicity', '*naphthoquinone', '*reactive oxygen species']",2020/07/24 06:00,2021/06/04 06:00,['2020/07/24 06:00'],"['2020/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-108374 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520620666200721124221 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2020;20(17):2089-2098. doi: 10.2174/1871520620666200721124221.,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['MCTI/CNPQ NO.73/2013/Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e', 'Tecnologico (CNPq)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we performed a meta-analysis of leukemia progression in over 300 individual Emicro-TCL1 transgenic mice and discovered a significantly accelerated disease progression in females compared to males. This difference is also reflected in an aggressive CLL mouse model with additional deletion of Tp53 besides the TCL1 transgene.

Testing our imidazo[1,2-b]pyrazole-7-carboxamide derivative on HL-60 cells, we obtained ERK phosphorylation as an early survival response to treatment followed by the increase of the percentage of the Bcl-xl(bright) and pAkt(bright) cells. Following the induction of Vav1 and the AP-1 complex, a driver of cellular differentiation, FOS, JUN, JUNB, and JUND were elevated on a concentration and time-dependent manner. As a proof of granulocytic differentiation, the cells remained non-adherent, the expression of CD33 decreased; the granularity, CD11b expression, and MPO activity of HL-60 cells increased upon treatment. Finally, viability of HL-60 cells was hampered shown by the depolarization of mitochondria, activation of caspase-3, cleavage of Z-DEVD-aLUC, appearance of the sub-G1 population, and the leakage of the lactate-dehydrogenase into the supernatant. We confirmed the differentiating effect of our drug candidate on human patient-derived AML cells shown by the increase of CD11b and decrease of CD33+, CD7+, CD206+, and CD38(bright) cells followed apoptosis (IC50: 80 nM) after treatment ex vivo.

The histone methyltransferase DOT1L is involved in supporting the proliferation of MLL-r cells, for which a target inhibitor, Pinometostat, has been evaluated in a clinical trial recruiting pediatric MLL-r leukemic patients. However, modest clinical effects have been observed. Recent studies have reported that additional leukemia subtypes lacking MLL-r are sensitive to DOT1L inhibition. Here, we report that targeting DOT1L with Pinometostat sensitizes pediatric AML cells to further treatment with the multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib, irrespectively of MLL-r. DOT1L pharmacologic inhibition induces AML cell differentiation and modulates the expression of genes with relevant roles in cancer development. Such modifications in the transcriptional program increase the apoptosis and growth suppression of both AML cell lines and primary pediatric AML cells with diverse genotypes. Through ChIP-seq analysis, we identified the genes regulated by DOT1L irrespective of MLL-r, including the Sorafenib target BRAF, providing mechanistic insights into the drug combination activity. Our results highlight a novel therapeutic strategy for pediatric AML patients.","['Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Indio, Valentina', 'Laginestra, Maria Antonella', 'Tarantino, Giuseppe', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Astolfi, Annalisa', 'Bertuccio, Salvatore N', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Masetti, Riccardo']","['Lonetti A', 'Indio V', 'Laginestra MA', 'Tarantino G', 'Chiarini F', 'Astolfi A', 'Bertuccio SN', 'Martelli AM', 'Locatelli F', 'Pession A', 'Masetti R']","['""Giorgio Prodi"" Cancer Research Center, University of Bologna, S.

It has been revealed that a few gene mutations are identified per AML patient. Some of these mutations are actionable mutations that affect the response to an approved targeted treatment that is available for off-label treatment or that is available in clinical trials. The era of precision medicine for AML has arrived, and it is extremely important to detect actionable mutations relevant to treatment decision-making. However, the percentage of actionable mutations found in AML is about 50% at present, and therapeutic development is also needed for AML patients without actionable mutations. In contrast, the newly approved drugs are less toxic than conventional intensive chemotherapy and can be combined with low-intensity treatments. These combination therapies can contribute to the improvement of prognosis, especially in elderly AML patients who account for more than half of all AML patients. Thus, the treatment strategy for leukemia is changing drastically and showing rapid progress.

If the process is impaired, thymopoiesis can be autonomously maintained for several weeks, but this causes leukemia. We aimed to understand the effect of cell competition on thymopoiesis, identify the cells involved, and determine how the process is regulated. Using thymus transplantation experiments, we found that cell competition occurs within the double-negative 2 (DN2) and 3 early (DN3e) thymocytes and inhibits thymus autonomy. Furthermore, the expansion of DN2b is regulated by a negative feedback loop that is imposed by double-positive thymocytes and determines the kinetics of thymopoiesis. This feedback loop affects the cell cycle duration of DN2b, in a response controlled by interleukin 7 availability.

A common clinical picture in children with JMML is that it presents as a constitutive hyperinflammatory syndrome, partially reminiscent of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in adults. Thus, a component of JMML is associated with a hyperinflammatory state and abundant innate immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes. Recently, we showed that the evolutionarily conserved mouse lncRNA Morrbid is specifically expressed in myeloid cells and uniquely represses the expression of the proapoptotic gene Bim to regulate the lifespan of myeloid cells. However, its role in JMML has not been investigated. In this study, we characterized the role of Morrbid and its target Bim, which are significantly dysregulated in Shp2E76K/+-bearing myeloid cells, in driving JMML. Loss of Morrbid in a mouse model of JMML driven by the Shp2E76K/+ mutation resulted in a significant correction of myeloid and erythroid cell abnormalities associated with JMML, including overall survival. Consistently, patients with JMML who had PTPN11, KRAS, and NRAS mutations and high expression of MORRBID manifested poor overall survival. Our results suggest that Morrbid contributes to JMML pathogenesis.","['Cai, Zhigang', 'Zhang, Chi', 'Kotzin, Jonathan J', 'Williams, Adam', 'Henao-Mejia, Jorge', 'Kapur, Reuben']","['Cai Z', 'Zhang C', 'Kotzin JJ', 'Williams A', 'Henao-Mejia J', 'Kapur R']","['Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, and.', 'Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute for Immunology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, CT; and.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute for Immunology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', ""Division of Protective Immunity, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)', 'pediatric multisystem inflammatory disease, COVID-19 related']",IM,"['Animals', 'COVID-19/complications', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/genetics', 'Mice', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics', '*RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome']",,,2020/07/23 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31547-0 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002123 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Jul 28;4(14):3246-3251. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020002123.,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['R01 CA173852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL146137/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL140961/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007910/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7391141,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Achieving a major molecular response early in treatment, as indicated by a BCR-ABL1 major international scale result of </=0.1% within 6 months, is associated with better patient outcomes and is statistically associated with a trough imatinib concentration of approximately 1000 ng/mL. Adherence to therapy, drug resistance, drug-drug interactions, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic factors may hinder attaining this target. Therapeutic drug monitoring of imatinib is not currently standard-of-care, but may help to evaluate adherence and optimize treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. This study aimed to evaluate imatinib concentrations in real-world patient plasma samples to identify the proportion of imatinib-treated patients who achieved the therapeutic target of 1000 ng/mL. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study that measured imatinib in residual plasma samples used for BCR-ABL1 tests (n = 1022) and analyzed clinician-ordered imatinib tests for therapeutic drug monitoring (n = 116). Imatinib was measured by competitive immunoassay. The frequency of imatinib concentrations achieving the therapeutic target was determined and correlated with BCR-ABL1 major international scale, age, and sex. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of patients tested for BCR-ABL1 may not have been prescribed or were not adherent to imatinib therapy. In the 29% of patients who did not achieve major molecular response, but had quantifiable imatinib concentrations, the therapeutic concentration was not met. For clinician-ordered imatinib tests, 45% of samples did not exceed the therapeutic target and 4% had potentially toxic plasma concentrations (>3000 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic drug monitoring for imatinib may assist clinicians in the identification of patients who may not be adherent to therapy, display variable pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics, or may be experiencing toxicity or treatment failure.","['Smy, Laura', 'Sadler, Aaron J', 'McMillin, Gwendolyn A']","['Smy L', 'Sadler AJ', 'McMillin GA']","['*Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah.

The objective of this study is to assess the medical expenditure and compensation of pediatric leukemia, and to explore the incidence and determinants of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) among households with pediatric leukemia patients in China. METHODS: A cross-sectional interview was conducted among households living with pediatric leukemia using a questionnaire in two tertiary hospitals. CHE was defined as out-of-pocket (OOP) payments that were greater than or equal to 40% of a household's capacity to pay (CTP). Chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis were performed to identify the determinants of CHE. RESULTS: Among 242 households living with pediatric leukemia, the mean OOP payment for pediatric leukemia healthcare was $9860, which accounted for approximately 35.7% of the mean household's CTP. The overall incidence of CHE was 43.4% and showed a downward trend with the lowest income group at 69.0% to the highest income group at 16.1%. The logistic regression model found that medical insurance, frequency of hospital admissions, charity assistance, and income level were significant predictors of CHE. CONCLUSION: The results revealed that pediatric leukemia had a significant catastrophic effect on families, especially those with lower economic status. The occurrence of CHE in households living with pediatric leukemia could be reduced by addressing income disparity. In addition, extending coverage and improving compensation from medical insurance could also alleviate CHE. Some other measures that can be implemented are to address the barriers of charity assistance for vulnerable groups.","['Sui, Mingjie', 'Zeng, Xueyun', 'Tan, Wan Jie', 'Tao, Sihai', 'Liu, Rui', 'Liu, Bo', 'Ma, Wenrui', 'Huang, Weidong', 'Yu, Hongjuan']","['Sui M', 'Zeng X', 'Tan WJ', 'Tao S', 'Liu R', 'Liu B', 'Ma W', 'Huang W', 'Yu H']","['School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Duke-NUS Medical School, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'North China University of Science and Technology, Hebei, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'School of Public Health, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Financial Stress/*economics/epidemiology', '*Health Care Costs', '*Health Expenditures', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Income', 'Infant', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Leukemia/*economics/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*catastrophic health expenditure', '*economic burden', '*leukemia', '*pediatric patients']",2020/07/23 06:00,2021/07/21 06:00,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.3317 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2020 Sep;9(18):6802-6812. doi: 10.1002/cam4.3317.

We conducted a phase 1 study with the combination of sorafenib (a FLT3-ITD inhibitor), plerixafor (a SDF-1/CXCR4 inhibitor), and G-CSF (that cleaves SDF-1, CD44, and VLA4). Twenty-eight patients with relapsed/refractory FLT3-ITD-mutated AML were enrolled from December 2010 to December 2013 at three dose levels of sorafenib (400, 600, and 800 mg twice daily) and G-CSF and plerixafor were administered every other day for seven doses starting on day one. Sorafenib 800 mg twice daily was selected for the expansion phase. While no dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were encountered in the four-week DLT window, hand-foot syndrome and rash were seen beyond the DLT window, which required dose reductions in most patients. The response rate was 36% (complete response (CR) = 4, complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) = 4, complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) = 1, and partial response (PR) = 1) for the intention to treat population. Treatment resulted in 58.4 and 47 mean fold mobilization of blasts and CD34 /38- stem/progenitor cells, respectively, to the circulation. Expression of the adhesion molecules CXCR4, CD44, and VLA4 on circulating leukemia cells correlated negatively with the mobilization of CD34+/38-, CD34+/38-/123+ ""progenitor"" cells (all P </= .002). Mass cytometry analysis of sequential samples from two patients demonstrated resistance emerging early on from sub-clones with persistent Akt and/or ERK signaling. In conclusion, the strategy of combined inhibition of FLT3 kinase and stromal adhesive interactions has promising activity in relapsed/refractory, FLT3-ITD-mutated AML, which warrants further evaluation in the front-line setting.","['Borthakur, Gautam', 'Zeng, Zhihong', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Chen, Hsiang-Chun', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Daver, Naval', 'Kelly, Mary A', 'McQueen, Teresa', 'Wang, Ru-Yiu', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Borthakur G', 'Zeng Z', 'Cortes JE', 'Chen HC', 'Huang X', 'Konopleva M', 'Ravandi F', 'Kadia T', 'Patel KP', 'Daver N', 'Kelly MA', 'McQueen T', 'Wang RY', 'Kantarjian H', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Benzylamines', 'Cyclams', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Sorafenib/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Survival Rate', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/blood/genetics']",,,2020/07/23 06:00,2020/12/30 06:00,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25943 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Nov;95(11):1296-1303. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25943.

METHOD: Children aged 0 to 18 years with gastrostomy tube insertions recorded between 1998 and 2014 were identified in the Swedish National Patient Register. Associations between disorder type and year of surgery, as well as age at surgery, were analysed using linear regression analyses. The association between disorder type and mortality 2 years from gastrostomy tube insertion was also analysed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The data for 4112 children (2182 males, 1930 females), with a median age of 2 years (interquartile range=1-8y), were analysed. Children who presented with developmental disorders were the largest group (n=3501, 85%). The most common diagnosis in children with developmental disorders was cerebral palsy (n=165, 4%). In children with acquired disorders, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n=117, 3%) was the most common diagnosis. Gastrostomy tube insertions increased from 1998 to 2014, with the greatest increase in children with developmental disorders, who were younger than children with acquired disorders when the gastrostomy tube was first inserted. Age at tube insertion decreased in both groups during the study period. Mortality was higher in children with acquired disorders, suggesting that gastrostomy tube insertion should be part of a palliative care approach. INTERPRETATION: Child characteristics differed depending on whether the underlying disorder was developmental or acquired, suggesting a need for clinical health care guidelines related to the specific goals of gastrostomy tube insertion. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Gastrostomy tube insertions increased by 140% from 1998 to 2014 in Sweden. The age of children with developmental disorders decreased by 1 month per year during the study period. Children presenting with developmental disorders were younger than children with acquired disorders when the gastrostomy tube was first inserted. Mortality was higher in children with acquired disorders.","['Backman, Ellen', 'Sjogreen, Lotta']","['Backman E', 'Sjogreen L']","['School of Health and Welfare, Halmstad University, Halmstad, Sweden.', 'Regional Habilitation Center, Region Halland, Kungsbacka, Sweden.', 'Orofacial Resource Centre for Rare Diseases, Public Dental Service, Mun-H-Center, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Health and Rehabilitation, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Dev Med Child Neurol,Developmental medicine and child neurology,0006761,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Developmental Disabilities', '*Enteral Nutrition', 'Female', 'Gastrostomy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sweden']",,,2020/07/23 06:00,2021/01/13 06:00,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/dmcn.14634 [doi]'],ppublish,Dev Med Child Neurol. 2020 Oct;62(10):1191-1197. doi: 10.1111/dmcn.14634.

METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied 1316 patients with myelofibrosis who presented at their institution between 1984 and 2018 and had available PB and BM blasts. RESULTS: The PB blast percentage influenced overall survival (OS) only among patients who had BM blasts <5%, with a median OS of 64 months for patients with 0% PB blasts, 48 months for those with 1% to 3% PB blasts, and 22 months for those with 4% PB blasts (P < .01). Patients who had 4% PB blasts and 5% to 9% BM/PB blasts had clinical features similar to those of patients who had 10% to 19% blasts. Although the OS of the former patients was longer than in patients who had 10% to 19% blasts, it was not statistically different (median OS: 22, 26, and 13 months, respectively; P > .05). Forty-four percent of patients received RUX throughout their disease course. All patients who had <10% blasts (PB or BM) and received treatment with RUX had superior OS compared with those who did not receive RUX within the same group. PB blasts >/=4% and BM blasts >/=5% were significant for predicting inferior survival in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The current results provide comprehensive insight into the role of peripheral blasts in patients with myelofibrosis and indicates that patients who have PB blasts >/=4% have an unfavorable prognosis. RUX provides a survival benefit to patients who have PB blasts <10%.","['Masarova, Lucia', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Daver, Naval G', 'Zhou, Lingsha', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Masarova L', 'Bose P', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Daver NG', 'Zhou L', 'Pierce S', 'Sasaki K', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Estrov Z', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitriles', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*blood/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*blasts', '*myelofibrosis', '*outcome', '*ruxolitinib']",2020/07/23 06:00,2021/06/12 06:00,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33094 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Oct 1;126(19):4322-4331. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33094.

However, several issues around this use are unresolved, including, among others, the most suitable time-point(s) for its application. Overall, late assessments appear more effective at distinguishing outcome but, in some studies, the early evaluations were already highly informative, anticipating the value of later ones. Our work integrated MRD with peripheral blast clearance (PBC), a treatment-related biomarker previously demonstrated to be a powerful predictor of response. From 2007 to 2014, we have studied 120 patients treated according to the NILG 02-06 trial and who achieved CR after induction. Patients in PBC-defined categories (separated by a 1.5-log threshold) showed significantly different probabilities of attaining MRD negativity, after either induction (MRD1) or consolidation (MRD2). Peripheral blast clearance combined with MRD1 largely anticipated MRD2-related information: when both biomarkers predicted chemosensitive disease (PBChigh /MRD1neg ), the rate of MRD2-negativity was 90%, and DFS and OS estimates were 68% and 76% at 3 years, respectively. When both markers were unfavorable (PBClow /MRD1pos ), rates of MRD2 negativity, DFS, and OS were 20%, 34%, and 24%, respectively, at 3 years. In fact, MRD2 added prognostic value only in cases with discordant PBC/MRD1 data. Our data support a reasoned timing for MRD-based therapeutic decisions, modulated on individual chemosensitivity, an approach we have implemented in a forthcoming prospective multi-center trial by Gruppo Italiano Malattie EMatologiche dell'Adulto (GIMEMA).","['Mannelli, Francesco', 'Gianfaldoni, Giacomo', 'Bencini, Sara', 'Piccini, Matteo', 'Cutini, Ilaria', 'Bonetti, Maria Ida', 'Scappini, Barbara', 'Pancani, Fabiana', 'Ponziani, Vanessa', 'Chiarini, Marco', 'Borlenghi, Erika', 'Bassan, Renato', 'Rossi, Giuseppe', 'Bosi, Alberto']","['Mannelli F', 'Gianfaldoni G', 'Bencini S', 'Piccini M', 'Cutini I', 'Bonetti MI', 'Scappini B', 'Pancani F', 'Ponziani V', 'Chiarini M', 'Borlenghi E', 'Bassan R', 'Rossi G', 'Bosi A']","['SOD Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca e Innovazione Malattie Mieloproliferative (CRIMM), AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'SOD Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'SOD Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Centro Diagnostico di Citofluorimetria e Immunoterapia, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'SOD Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'SOD Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'SOD Terapie Cellulari e Medicina Trasfusionale AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'SOD Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Centro Diagnostico di Citofluorimetria e Immunoterapia, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'SOD Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'SOD Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'SOD Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologica AIL (CREA), Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Laboratorio di Citofluorimetria; Dipartimento di Diagnostica di Laboratorio, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Divisione di Ematologia, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', ""Unita Operativa di Ematologia, Ospedale dell'Angelo, Mestre - Venezia, Italy."", 'Divisione di Ematologia, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'SOD Ematologia, Universita di Firenze, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', '*Blast Crisis/blood/mortality/therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Survival Rate']",,,2020/07/23 06:00,2020/12/30 06:00,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25942 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Nov;95(11):1304-1313. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25942.

A quality-adjusted time without symptoms of disease progression or toxicity (Q-TWiST) approach was used to evaluate comparative quality-adjusted survival. METHODS: Overall survival was partitioned into the following: time with any treatment-emergent grade 3 or higher adverse events (TOX); time without symptoms of disease progression or toxicity (TWiST); and time after treatment discontinuation due to insufficient clinical response, relapse, or death time after progression (REL). Q-TWiST was calculated by multiplying the restricted mean time in each state by respective utilities and then summing up the utility-adjusted time. RESULTS: At 20 months of follow-up, the survival probabilities for the glasdegib-LDAC arm and the LDAC arm were 28.2% and 7.9%, respectively. Glasdegib-LDAC patients (n = 78), in comparison with LDAC patients (n = 38), had significantly longer mean TWiST (+3.4 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-5.2 months) and TOX (+0.8 months; 95% CI, 0.1-1.6 months) and longer but nonsignificant REL (+0.3 months; 95% CI, -1.9 to 2.3 months). Q-TWiST was 4.0 months (95% CI, 2.1-5.8 months) longer with glasdegib plus LDAC, and this translated into a 75% relative improvement in quality-adjusted survival with respect to LDAC. Results were robust to the length of follow-up (6-24 months) and remained significant when all adverse events, regardless of grade, were included. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that most of the survival benefit from glasdegib plus LDAC versus LDAC alone is TWiST, and this represents added time in relatively ""good"" health. These results support the clinical value of glasdegib plus LDAC as initial therapy for AML in patients for whom intensive chemotherapy is not an option.","['Solem, Caitlyn T', 'Bell, Timothy J', 'Kwon, Youngmin', 'Cappelleri, Joseph C', 'Johnson, Courtney', 'Bhattacharyya, Helen', 'Hoang, Caroline J', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Solem CT', 'Bell TJ', 'Kwon Y', 'Cappelleri JC', 'Johnson C', 'Bhattacharyya H', 'Hoang CJ', 'Cortes JE']","['Pharmerit - an OPEN Health Company, Bethesda.', 'Pfizer, Inc, New York, New York.', 'Pharmerit - an OPEN Health Company, Bethesda.', 'Pfizer, Inc, New York, New York.', 'Pfizer, Inc, New York, New York.', 'Pharmerit - an OPEN Health Company, Bethesda.', 'Pfizer, Inc, New York, New York.', 'Pfizer, Inc, New York, New York.', 'Pharmerit - an OPEN Health Company, Bethesda.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'K673DMO5H9 (glasdegib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*glasdegib', '*low-dose cytarabine', '*quality of life', '*quality-adjusted survival', '*quality-adjusted time without symptoms of disease progression or toxicity', '(Q-TWiST)']",2020/07/23 06:00,2021/06/12 06:00,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.33072 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 Oct 1;126(19):4315-4321. doi: 10.1002/cncr.33072.

Although IA risk factors have been identified, few data are available on impact of IA, occurring during induction phase, on overall AML outcome. PATIENTS AND RESULTS: The end point of this multicentre, case-control, study was to evaluate whether IA, occurring after first induction CHT, can affect treatment schedule and patient's outcome. We identified 40 AML patients (cases) who developed IA during first induction phase, 31 probable (77.5%) and 9 proven (22.5%). These cases were matched with a control group (80 AML) without IA, balanced according to age, type of CHT, AML characteristics and cytogenetic-molecular risk factors. The overall response rate to induction CHT was the same in the 2 groups. In the 40 cases with IA, the overall response rate to antifungal treatment was favourable (80%) but it was significantly affected by the achievement of leukaemia complete remission (CR) with induction CHT. In fact, in cases with AML responsive to induction CHT, responses of IA to antifungal therapy were 96% compared to 21% in cases of AML not responsive to induction treatment (P < .0001). The adherence to the schedule and full doses of CHT were reported in 35% of cases (14/40) and in 76% of controls (61/80) (P = .0001; OR 6.7; 95% CI 2.7-16.6). After first induction CHT, a significant higher number of cases (15/40; 37.5%) compared to controls (9/80; 11%) could not receive additional cycles of CHT (P = .0011, OR 4.8; 95% CI 1.9-12.3). The IA-related mortality was 22.5%. The median OS of cases was significantly worse than OS of controls with a difference of 12.3 months (12.1 vs 24.4 months, P = .04). However, the occurrence of IA during first induction phase did not have a significant impact on the OS of cases who achieved a CR of AML with induction CHT which are able to proceed, despite the IA, with their therapeutic program, achieving the same OS as the control group with AML in CR (P = ns). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that IA during first induction CHT can delay the subsequent therapeutic program and has a significant impact on OS, specifically in AML patients who did not achieved a CR of AML with the first course of CHT.","['Candoni, Anna', 'Farina, Francesca', 'Perruccio, Katia', 'Di Blasi, Roberta', 'Criscuolo, Marianna', 'Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Delia, Mario', 'Zannier, Maria Elena', 'Dragonetti, Giulia', 'Fanci, Rosa', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Vianelli, Nicola', 'Chierichini, Anna', 'Garzia, Mariagrazia', 'Petruzzellis, Giuseppe', 'Nadali, Gianpaolo', 'Verga, Luisa', 'Busca, Alessandro', 'Pagano, Livio']","['Candoni A', 'Farina F', 'Perruccio K', 'Di Blasi R', 'Criscuolo M', 'Cattaneo C', 'Delia M', 'Zannier ME', 'Dragonetti G', 'Fanci R', 'Martino B', 'Del Principe MI', 'Fianchi L', 'Vianelli N', 'Chierichini A', 'Garzia M', 'Petruzzellis G', 'Nadali G', 'Verga L', 'Busca A', 'Pagano L']","['Clinica Ematologica, Azienda Sanitaria-Universitaria Friuli Centrale (ASUFC), Udine, Italy.', 'IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Ospedale SM Misericordia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ematologia, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

It is implicated in the formation of so-called ""membraneless organelles"" such as nucleoli, nuclear speckles, promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies, P bodies, and stress granules along with the formation of biomolecular condensates involved in transcription, signaling, and transport. Quantitative studies of LLPS in vivo are complicated by the out-of-equilibrium, multicomponent cellular environment. While in vitro experiments with purified biomolecules are inherently an oversimplification of the cellular milieu, they allow probing of the rich physical chemistry underlying phase separation. Critically, with the application of suitable models, the thermodynamics of equilibrium LLPS can inform on the nature of the intermolecular interactions that mediate it. These same interactions are likely to exist in out-of-equilibrium condensates within living cells. Phase diagrams map the coexistence points between dense and light phases and quantitatively describe LLPS by mapping the local minima of free energy versus biomolecule concentration.

Examples of such biomolecular condensates are the nucleolus, nuclear speckles, promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) bodies and paraspeckles in the nucleus, and stress granules and P bodies in the cytoplasm. Other structures in cells that are not typically viewed as bona fide compartments also seem to be formed via LLPS as recently elucidated, including heterochromatin, super-enhancers, and membrane receptor clusters. Key protein and/or RNA components of these biomolecular condensates form a scaffold via LLPS. Other constituents incorporate into this scaffold as clients. To understand the sequence features and interactions that mediate biomolecular condensate formation in cells, it is useful to quantify phase separation of pure components in vitro. Microscopy and turbidity measurements can be used to determine the concentration of a protein above which it phase separates, the so-called saturation concentration. Here, we describe experiments for the determination of full coexistence lines of phase-separating proteins by centrifugation. Coexistence lines are reconstructed from coexisting light and dense phase concentrations of the protein, and we present them as so-called phase diagrams. Phase diagrams allow the quantitative comparison of phase separation for proteins and their mutants under different conditions. They are thus important for our nuanced understanding of the driving forces underlying liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro. Such results have direct applicability for understanding phase separation-driven compartmentalization of cells.","['Milkovic, Nicole M', 'Mittag, Tanja']","['Milkovic NM', 'Mittag T']","[""Department of Structural Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Structural Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. tanja.mittag@stjude.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1)', '0 (Intrinsically Disordered Proteins)']",IM,"['Artifacts', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Centrifugation/*methods', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Intrinsically Disordered Proteins/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Static Electricity', 'Temperature']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Centrifugation', '*Coexistence line', '*Demixing', '*IDP', '*Intrinsically disordered protein', '*LLPS', '*Liquid-liquid phase separation']",2020/07/23 06:00,2021/03/16 06:00,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-0716-0524-0_35 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2020;2141:685-702. doi: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0524-0_35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we aimed to explored the chemosensitizing effect of 4-HPR on AML therapy. METHODS: Luciferase reporter assays were used to test the effect of 4-HPR on transcriptional signaling pathways. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblots were used to confirm the role of 4-HPR in NF-kappaB inhibition, apoptosis, and drug resistance. MTT and flow cytometry assays were applied to test the drug response and chemosensitizing effect of 4-HPR with AML cell lines and primary AML samples. RESULTS: 4-HPR suppressed tumor necrosis factor-alpha- and daunorubin-induced NF-kappaB activation in AML cell lines. The expression of anti-apoptotic gene, BCL2, was downregulated, while expressions of pro-apoptotic genes, cIAP, XIAP, and BID, were increased after 4-HPR treatment. Immunoblots showed decreased p65-NF-kappaB, IkappaBalpha, and MDR1, but increased cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and BIM. A low concentration of 4-HPR chemosensitized AML cells to daunorubin treatment in vitro. CONCLUSION: 4-HPR-induced NF-kappaB inhibition was the main driver of the chemosensitizing effect observed in AML cell lines and primary AML samples. These results highlight that 4-HPR might be a promising chemosensitizing agent in AML therapy.","['Zhang, Hui', 'Xu, Haoyu', 'Zhang, Ranran', 'Zhao, Xinying', 'Liang, Ming', 'Wei, Fenggui']","['Zhang H', 'Xu H', 'Zhang R', 'Zhao X', 'Liang M', 'Wei F']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, 510623, Guangdong, China. zhanghuirjh@gwcmc.org."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510120, Guangdong, China. zhanghuirjh@gwcmc.org.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, 510623, Guangdong, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510120, Guangdong, China.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center, Guangzhou, 510623, Guangdong, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510120, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510120, Guangdong, China. wwidelia@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Synergism', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['*4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Chemosensitizing effect', '*Nuclear factor-kappa B inhibition']",2020/07/23 06:00,2021/02/18 06:00,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-020-04115-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-020-04115-y [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2020 Aug;86(2):257-266. doi: 10.1007/s00280-020-04115-y.

In mice, deficiency of Friend leukaemia integration 1 transcription factor (Fli1) causes SSc-like disease with these features. The human FLI1 gene contains (GA)n microsatellite, which has been shown to be associated with expression level. Because microsatellite polymorphisms are difficult to capture by genome-wide association studies, we directly genotyped FLI1 (GA)n microsatellite and examined its association with SSc. METHODS: Genomic DNA from 639 Japanese SSc patients and 851 healthy controls was genotyped for (GA)n microsatellite using the fragment assay. The cut-off repeat number for susceptibility to SSc was determined by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. Association with susceptibility and clinical characteristics was examined using logistic regression analysis. FLI1 mRNA levels were determined using quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Based on the ROC analysis, (GA)n alleles with >/=22 repeats were collectively defined as L alleles and alleles with </=21 repeats as S alleles. (GA)n L alleles were significantly associated with susceptibility to SSc (P = 5.0e-04, odds ratio 1.34, additive model). Significant association was observed both in diffuse cutaneous and limited cutaneous SSc. Among the SSc, (GA)n L alleles were significantly enriched in the patients with a modified Rodnan total skin thickness score >/=10 compared with those with a score <10. FLI1 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in healthy controls carrying (GA)n L alleles as compared with non-carriers. CONCLUSION: Extended repeat alleles of FLI1 (GA)n microsatellite may be associated with lower FLI1 mRNA levels and susceptibility to human SSc.","['Yamashita, Keita', 'Kawasaki, Aya', 'Matsushita,

Observations: A patient initially diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy presented with a chief complaint of subjective intermittent loss of colour vision in both eyes, as well as intermittent bilateral white-out vision. These symptoms previously went uninvestigated until a thorough history revealed concurrent constitutional symptoms including recent night sweats and fevers. Closer fundus examination revealed that the lesions previously thought to be diabetic retinal hemorrhages were Roth spots. Conclusions and Importance: An unusual chief complaint of colour vision loss and multiple Roth spots in the context of chronic night sweats and fevers prompted further workup. A CBC with differential revealed a markedly increased WBC count and the patient was diagnosed with CML. Cytoreduction therapy led to complete resolution of the patient's visual symptoms and a return to normal WBC count at the most recent follow up appointment.

However, it is acknowledged that this rearrangement alone is not able to induce the whole leukemic phenotype. In addition, epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, may play a crucial role in leukemia pathogenesis. DNA methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), involves the covalent transfer of a methyl group (-CH3) to the fifth carbon of the cytosine ring in the CpG dinucleotide and results in the formation of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC). The aberrant gene promoter methylation can be an alternative mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation. Understanding cancer epigenetics and its pivotal role in oncogenesis, can offer us not only attractive targets for epigenetic treatment but can also provide powerful tools in monitoring the disease and estimating the prognosis. Several genes of interest, such as RARA, RARB, p15, p16, have been studied in APL and their methylation status was correlated with potential diagnostic and prognostic significance. In the present manuscript we comprehensively examine the current knowledge regarding DNA methylation in APL pathogenesis. We also discuss the perspectives of using the DNA methylation patterns as reliable biomarkers for measurable residual disease (MRD) monitoring and as a predictor of relapse. This work also highlights the possibility of detecting aberrant methylation profiles of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) through liquid biopsies, using the conventional methods, such as methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR), sequencing methods, but also revolutionary methods, such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).","['Turcas, Cristina', 'Moisoiu, Vlad', 'Stefancu, Andrei', 'Jurj, Ancuta', 'Iancu, Stefania D', 'Teodorescu, Patric', 'Pasca, Sergiu', 'Bojan, Anca', 'Trifa, Adrian', 'Iluta, Sabina', 'Zimta, Alina-Andreea', 'Petrushev, Bobe', 'Zdrenghea, Mihnea', 'Bumbea, Horia', 'Coriu, Daniel', 'Dima, Delia', 'Leopold, Nicolae', 'Tomuleasa, Ciprian']","['Turcas C', 'Moisoiu V', 'Stefancu A', 'Jurj A', 'Iancu SD', 'Teodorescu P', 'Pasca S', 'Bojan A', 'Trifa A', 'Iluta S', 'Zimta AA', 'Petrushev B', 'Zdrenghea M', 'Bumbea H', 'Coriu D', 'Dima D', 'Leopold N', 'Tomuleasa C']","['Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, ""Ion Chiricuta"" Institute of Oncology, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Faculty of Physics, Babes Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Faculty of Physics, Babes Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Faculty of Physics, Babes Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, ""Ion Chiricuta"" Institute of Oncology, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, ""Ion Chiricuta"" Institute of Oncology, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, ""Ion Chiricuta"" Institute of Oncology, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, ""Ion Chiricuta"" Institute of Oncology, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Medfuture Research Center for Advanced Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Medfuture Research Center for Advanced Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, ""Ion Chiricuta"" Institute of Oncology, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, ""Ion Chiricuta"" Institute of Oncology, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Faculty of Physics, Babes Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, ""Ion Chiricuta"" Institute of Oncology, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'disease monitoring', 'measurable residual disease', 'patient follow-up']",2020/07/23 06:00,2020/07/23 06:01,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.01024 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jun 29;10:1024. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.01024. eCollection 2020.,,20200629,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Turcas, Moisoiu, Stefancu, Jurj, Iancu, Teodorescu, Pasca,', 'Bojan, Trifa, Iluta, Zimta, Petrushev, Zdrenghea, Bumbea, Coriu, Dima, Leopold', 'and Tomuleasa.']",,PMC7336895,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inside a solid tumor mass, the hypoxia stems largely from inadequate supply of oxygenated blood through sparse or misshapen tumor vasculature whilst oxygen utilization rates are low in typical tumor's glycolytic metabolism. In acute leukemias, however, markers of intracellular hypoxia such as increased pimonidazole adduct staining and HIF-1alpha stabilization are observed in advanced leukemic bone marrows (BM) despite an increase in BM vasculogenesis. We utilized intravital fast scanning two-photon phosphorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FaST-PLIM) in a BCR-ABL B-ALL mouse model to image the extracellular oxygen concentrations (pO2) in leukemic BM, and we related the extracellular oxygen levels to intracellular hypoxia, vascular markers and local leukemia burden. We observed a transient increase in BM pO2 in initial disease stages with intermediate leukemia BM burden, which correlated with an expansion of blood-carrying vascular network in the BM. Yet, we also observed increased formation of intracellular pimonidazole adducts in leukemic BM at the same time. This intermediate stage was followed by a significant decrease of extracellular pO2 and further increase of intracellular hypoxia as leukemia cellularity overwhelmed BM in disease end-stage. Remarkably, treatment of leukemic mice with IACS-010759, a pharmacological inhibitor of mitochondrial Complex I, substantially increased pO2 in the BM with advanced B-ALL, and it alleviated intracellular hypoxia reported by pimonidazole staining. High rates of oxygen consumption by B-ALL cells were confirmed by Seahorse assay including in ex vivo cells. Our results suggest that B-ALL expansion in BM is associated with intense oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) leading to the onset of metabolic BM hypoxia despite increased BM vascularization. Targeting mitochondrial respiration may be a novel approach to counteract BM hypoxia in B-ALL and, possibly, tumor hypoxia in other OxPhos-reliant malignancies.","['Rytelewski, Mateusz', 'Harutyunyan, Karine', 'Baran, Natalia', 'Mallampati, Saradhi', 'Zal, M Anna', 'Cavazos, Antonio', 'Butler, Jason M', 'Konoplev, Sergej', 'El Khatib, Mirna', 'Plunkett, Shane', 'Marszalek, Joseph R', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Zal, Tomasz', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Rytelewski M', 'Harutyunyan K', 'Baran N', 'Mallampati S', 'Zal MA', 'Cavazos A', 'Butler JM', 'Konoplev S', 'El Khatib M', 'Plunkett S', 'Marszalek JR', 'Andreeff M', 'Zal T', 'Konopleva M']","['Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Translational Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Weill Cornell Medicine, Medical School of Biological Sciences, Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack University Medical Center, Nutley, NJ, United States.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'TRACTION, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Immunology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphobastic leukemia', 'bone marrow', 'hypoxia', 'leukemia', 'oxidative phosphorylation', 'oxygen', 'vascularity']",2020/07/23 06:00,2020/07/23 06:01,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00991 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jun 30;10:991. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00991. eCollection 2020.,,20200630,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Rytelewski, Harutyunyan, Baran, Mallampati, Zal, Cavazos,', 'Butler, Konoplev, El Khatib, Plunkett, Marszalek, Andreeff, Zal and Konopleva.']","['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB018464/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA231364/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 NS092986/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'K25 HL145092/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7339962,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Along the years, it has been repeatedly shown that minimal residual disease (MRD) plays an important role in prognosis and therapy choice. The aim of the current study was to determine the prognostic role of MRD in childhood ALL patients in conjunction with other relevant patient and disease characteristics, thus showing the real-life scenario of childhood ALL. Patients and Methods: The retrospective study includes childhood ALL patients that were treated according to the BFM ALL IC 2009 between January 2016 and December 2018 at the Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania. Results: None of the variables significantly influenced the induction-related death in our study. None of the variables independently predicted relapse-free survival (RFS) with the highest tendency for statistical significance being represented by poor prednisone response. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was independently predicted by age, prednisone response, and day 33 flow cytometry-MRD (FCM-MRD). Overall survival (OS) was independently predicted by prednisone response and day 33 FCM-MRD. Event-free survival (EFS) was independently predicted by age, prednisone response, and day 33 FCM-MRD. Conclusion : Prednisone response, day 15 FCM-MRD, day 33 FCM-MRD, and the risk group represent the most important factors that in the current study independently predict childhood ALL prognosis.","['Radu, Letitia-Elena', 'Colita, Andrei', 'Pasca, Sergiu', 'Tomuleasa, Ciprian', 'Popa, Codruta', 'Serban, Catalin', 'Gheorghe, Anca', 'Serbanica, Andreea', 'Jercan, Cristina', 'Marcu, Andra', 'Bica, Ana', 'Teodorescu, Patric', 'Constantinescu, Catalin', 'Petrushev, Bobe', 'Asan, Minodora', 'Jardan, Cerasela', 'Dragomir, Mihaela', 'Tanase, Alina', 'Colita, Anca']","['Radu LE', 'Colita A', 'Pasca S', 'Tomuleasa C', 'Popa C', 'Serban C', 'Gheorghe A', 'Serbanica A', 'Jercan C', 'Marcu A', 'Bica A', 'Teodorescu P', 'Constantinescu C', 'Petrushev B', 'Asan M', 'Jardan C', 'Dragomir M', 'Tanase A', 'Colita A']","['Department of Medicine, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Medicine, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Coltea Hospital, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Research Center for Functional Genomics and Translational Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology Institute Prof. Dr. Ion Chiricuta, Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Medicine, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Medicine, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Medicine, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology Institute Prof. Dr. Ion Chiricuta, Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology Institute Prof. Dr. Ion Chiricuta, Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Medfuture Research Center for Advanced Medicine, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Medicine, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Medicine, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'MRD', 'children', 'flow cytometry', 'survival']",2020/07/23 06:00,2020/07/23 06:01,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00923 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jun 30;10:923. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00923. eCollection 2020.,,20200630,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Radu, Colita, Pasca, Tomuleasa, Popa, Serban, Gheorghe,', 'Serbanica, Jercan, Marcu, Bica, Teodorescu, Constantinescu, Petrushev, Asan,', 'Jardan, Dragomir, Tanase and Colita.']",,PMC7338564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, since not all NK cells are equally effective at targeting cancer, selecting the right donor for cellular therapy is critical for the success of the treatment. Recently, cellular therapies utilising NK cells from cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seropositive donors have been explored. However, whether these NK cells are the best source to treat paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) remains unclear. Methods: Using a panel of patient-derived paediatric B- and T-ALL, we assessed the ability of NK cells from 49 healthy donors to mount an effective functional response against these two major subtypes of ALL. Results: From this cohort, we have identified a pool of donors with superior activity against multiple ALL cells. While these donors were more likely to be CMV(+), we identified multiple CMV(neg) donors within this group. Furthermore, NK cells from these donors recognised B- and T-ALL through different activating receptors. Dividing functional NK cells into 29 unique subsets, we observed that within each individual the same NK cell subsets dominated across all ALL cells. Intriguingly, this occurred despite the ALL cells in our panel expressing different combinations of NK cell ligands. Finally, we can demonstrate that cellular therapy products derived from these superior donors significantly delayed leukaemia progression in preclinical models of ALL. Conclusions: We have identified a pool of superior donors that are effective against a range of ALL cells, representing a potential pool of donors that can be used as an adoptive NK cell therapy to treat paediatric ALL.","['Foley, Bree', 'Ta, Clara', 'Barnes, Samantha', 'de Jong, Emma', 'Nguyen, Michelle', 'Cheung, Laurence C', 'Buzzai, Anthony', 'Wagner, Teagan', 'Wylie, Ben', 'Fernandez, Sonia', 'Cruickshank, Mark', 'Endersby, Raelene', 'Kees, Ursula', 'Waithman, Jason']","['Foley B', 'Ta C', 'Barnes S', 'de Jong E', 'Nguyen M', 'Cheung LC', 'Buzzai A', 'Wagner T', 'Wylie B', 'Fernandez S', 'Cruickshank M', 'Endersby R', 'Kees U', 'Waithman J']","['Telethon Kids Institute University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences Curtin University Perth Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.', 'Telethon Kids Institute University of Western Australia Nedlands Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Clin Transl Immunology,Clinical & translational immunology,101638268,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'cellular therapy', 'cytomegalovirus', 'natural killer cells']",2020/07/23 06:00,2020/07/23 06:01,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/cti2.1151 [doi]', 'CTI21151 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Transl Immunology. 2020 Jul 16;9(7):e1151. doi: 10.1002/cti2.1151. eCollection 2020.,,20200716,,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Materials and Methods: The study included 74 ALL patients. Polymerase chain reaction and genotyping of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) rs1801133, MTHFR rs1801131, ATP-binding cassette superfamily B1 (ABCB1) rs1045642, ATP-binding cassette superfamily G2 (ABCG2) rs2231142 and solute carrier 19A1 (SLC19A1) rs1051266 genetic variations were performed. The plasma MTX levels were investigated at 48 hr after the first dose of MTX infusion. Results: MTHFR rs1801133 TT genotype, ABCBa1 rs1045642 CT genotype and ABCG2 rs2231142 CA genotype revealed a statistically significant association with the MTX plasma levels (P<0.01, P<0.05, P<0.05, respectively). The MTHFR rs1801133 TT genotype had a statistically significant association with hematopoietic toxicity (P<0.01) and interventions (P<0.05). The MTHFR rs1801131 AC genotype was related to the decreased hepatic toxicity (P<0.05). The SLC19A1 rs 1051266 GA genotype was related to the increased hepatic toxicity (P<0.05). Only the ABCB1 rs1045642 CT and TT genotypes had a statistically significant correlation with EFS (P<0.05, P<0.05, respectively). Conclusion: Our findings showed that genetic polymorphism could be associated with plasma MTX levels, toxicity experienced and EFS in Iranian pediatric ALL.","['Esmaili, Mohammad Ali', 'Kazemi, Ahmad', 'Faranoush, Mohammad', 'Mellstedt, Hakan', 'Zaker, Farhad', 'Safa, Majid', 'Mehrvar, Narjes', 'Rezvany, Mohammad Reza']","['Esmaili MA', 'Kazemi A', 'Faranoush M', 'Mellstedt H', 'Zaker F', 'Safa M', 'Mehrvar N', 'Rezvany MR']","['Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Pediatric Growth and Development Research Center, Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Mahak Hematology Oncology Research Center (MAHAK-HORC), Mahak Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Immune and Gene Therapy Lab, Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institute, Stockholm 17176, Sweden.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, School of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Department of Hematology, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Pediatric Growth and Development Research Center, Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Immune and Gene Therapy Lab, Cancer Center Karolinska (CCK), Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institute, Stockholm 17176, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran J Basic Med Sci,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,101517966,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABCB1', 'ABCG2', 'Genetic polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'MTHFR', 'Methotrexate', 'Pediatric acute', 'SLC19A1', 'lymphoblastic- leukemia']",2020/07/23 06:00,2020/07/23 06:01,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22038/ijbms.2020.41754.9858 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran J Basic Med Sci. 2020 Jun;23(6):800-809. doi: 10.22038/ijbms.2020.41754.9858.,,,,,,PMC7351433,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, Nigella sativa or black cumin, a medicinal plant rich in bioactive compounds, has been used worldwide for food purposes or in traditional medicines. This paper aims to reveal N. sativa potential as adjunct treatment in cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and hematological malignancies, due to their increasing prevalence and difficult management in everyday life. Materials and Methods: Databases like PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar were used to search the literature data. Keywords like anti-inflammatory effect, anti-oxidant effect, antihypertensive effects, hypolipidemic effects and hematological malignancies were used in combination with N. sativa. Results: Because of its numerous pharmacological actions, but especially for its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated N. sativa positive effect against diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of them associated to cardiovascular diseases progression. Also, it was proved to have marked anti-proliferative, cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic, and anti-metastatic effects, in both solid cancers and hematological malignancies. Conclusion: N. sativa used as complementary treatment to classical medications can improve the management of several chronic diseases.","['Pop, Raluca Maria', 'Trifa, Adrian Pavel', 'Popolo, Ada', 'Chedea, Veronica Sanda', 'Militaru, Claudia', 'Bocsan, Ioana Corina', 'Buzoianu, Anca Dana']","['Pop RM', 'Trifa AP', 'Popolo A', 'Chedea VS', 'Militaru C', 'Bocsan IC', 'Buzoianu AD']","['Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Clinical Pharmacology, Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Department of Genetics, Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'University of Salerno, Department of Pharmacy, Fisciano, Salerno, Italy.', 'Research Station for Viticulture and Enology Blaj, Blaj, Romania.', 'Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Clinical Pharmacology, Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Clinical Pharmacology, Cluj Napoca, Romania.', 'Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Clinical Pharmacology, Cluj Napoca, Romania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Iran,Iran J Basic Med Sci,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,101517966,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-inflammatory agents', 'Anti-oxidants', 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'Diabetes mellitus', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Multiple myeloma', 'Nigella sativa']",2020/07/23 06:00,2020/07/23 06:01,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22038/ijbms.2020.37734.8978 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran J Basic Med Sci. 2020 Jun;23(6):699-713. doi: 10.22038/ijbms.2020.37734.8978.,,,,,,PMC7351440,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) is a potent toxin that is used for the killing moiety in many immunotoxins. Moxetumomab Pasudotox (Lumoxiti) contains an anti-CD22 Fv and a 38 kDa portion of PE. Lumoxiti was discovered in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the U.S. National Cancer Institute and co-developed with Medimmune/AstraZeneca to treat hairy cell leukemia. In 2018 Lumoxiti was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of drug-resistant Hairy Cell Leukemia. Due to the bacterial origin of the killing moiety, immunotoxins containing PE are highly immunogenic in patients with normal immune systems, but less immunogenic in patients with hematologic malignancies, whose immune systems are often compromised. LMB-100 is a de-immunized variant of the toxin with a humanized antibody that targets mesothelin and a PE toxin that was rationally designed for diminished reactivity with antibodies and B cell receptors. It is now being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer and is showing somewhat diminished immunogenicity compared to its un modified parental counterpart. Here we review the immunogenicity of the original and de-immunized PE immunotoxins in mice and patients, the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), their impact on drug availability and their effect on clinical efficacy. Efforts to mitigate the immunogenicity of immunotoxins and its impact on immunogenicity will be described including rational design to identify, remove, or suppress B cell or T cell epitopes, and combination of immunotoxins with immune modulating drugs.","['Mazor, Ronit', 'Pastan, Ira']","['Mazor R', 'Pastan I']","['Division of Cellular and Gene Therapies, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Msln protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (toxA protein, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)', 'J27WDC343N (Mesothelin)']",IM,"['ADP Ribose Transferases/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibody Formation/immunology', 'Bacterial Toxins/immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Exotoxins/chemistry/*immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunomodulation/drug effects', 'Immunotoxins/chemistry/*immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Mesothelin', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Pseudomonas/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Virulence Factors/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell epitopes', '*LMB-100', '*T cell epitopes', '*anti-drug antibodies (ADA)', '*moxetumomab pasudotox', '*neutralizing antibodies', '*recombinant immunotoxins']",2020/07/23 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.01261 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Jun 26;11:1261. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.01261. eCollection 2020.,,20200626,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Mazor and Pastan.'],,PMC7333791,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A total of 102 AML patients and 108 healthy controls were enrolled in this case-control study. TERT gene rs2853669 and rs2736100 polymorphisms were genotyped via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Chi-square test was applied to compare polymorphism distributions between case and control groups. The strength of the association between TERT gene polymorphisms and AML susceptibility was evaluated utilizing odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: CC genotype and C allele of rs2736100 polymorphism were more frequent in AML patients (P < 0.05), and individuals carrying CC genotype showed higher risk of suffering from AML (OR = 2.632, 95% CI 1.129-6.133). But for rs2853669 polymorphism, no significant differences were detected in either genotype or allele distributions between groups (P > 0.05).

FLT3 inhibitors have provided novel strategies for the treatment of FLT3-ITD-positive AML. But they are limited by rapid development of acquired resistance and refractory in monotherapy. Recent evidence shows that inducing the degradation of FLT3-mutated protein is an attractive strategy for the treatment of FLT3-ITD-positive AML, especially those with FLT3 inhibitor resistance. In this study we identified Wu-5 as a novel USP10 inhibitor inducing the degradation of FLT3-mutated protein. We showed that Wu-5 selectively inhibited the viability of FLT3 inhibitor-sensitive (MV4-11, Molm13) and -resistant (MV4-11R) FLT3-ITD-positive AML cells with IC50 of 3.794, 5.056, and 8.386 muM, respectively. Wu-5 (1-10 muM) dose-dependently induced apoptosis of MV4-11, Molm13, and MV4-11R cells through the proteasome-mediated degradation of FLT3-ITD. We further demonstrated that Wu-5 directly interacted with and inactivated USP10, the deubiquitinase for FLT3-ITD in vitro (IC50 value = 8.3 microM) and in FLT3-ITD-positive AML cells. Overexpression of USP10 abrogated Wu-5-induced FLT3-ITD degradation and cell death. Also, the combined treatment of Wu-5 and crenolanib produced synergistic cell death in FLT3-ITD-positive cells via the reduction of both FLT3 and AMPKalpha proteins. In support of this, AMPKalpha inhibitor compound C synergistically enhanced the anti-leukemia effect of crenolanib, while AMPKalpha activator metformin inhibited the anti-leukemia effect of crenolanib. In summary, we demonstrate that Wu-5, a novel USP10 inhibitor, can overcome FLT3 inhibitor resistance and synergistically enhance the anti-AML effect of crenolanib through targeting FLT3 and AMPKalpha pathway.","['Yu, Miao', 'Fang, Zhi-Xiao', 'Wang, Wei-Wei', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Bu, Zhi-Lei', 'Liu, Meng', 'Xiao, Xin-Hua', 'Zhang, Zi-Lu', 'Zhang, Xing-Ming', 'Cao, Yang', 'Wang, Ying-Ying', 'Lei, Hu',

Relapse-specific mutations can be identified by comprehensive genome sequencing and might have clinical significance. Applying whole-exome sequencing to eight triplicate samples, we identified in one patient relapse-specific mutations in the folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) gene, whose product catalyzes the addition of multiple glutamate residues (polyglutamation) to methotrexate upon their entry into the cells. To determine the prevalence of mutations of the FPGS mutations, and those of two important genes in the thiopurine pathway, NT5C2 and PRPS1, we studied 299 diagnostic and 73 relapsed samples in 372 patients. Three more FPGS mutants were identified in two patients, NT5C2 mutations in six patients, and PRPS1 mutants in two patients. One patient had both NT5C2 and PRPS1 mutants. None of these alterations were detected at diagnosis with a sequencing depth of 1000X, suggesting that treatment pressure led to increased prevalence of mutations during therapy. Functional characterization of the FPGS mutants showed that they directly resulted in decreased enzymatic activity, leading to significant reduction in methotrexate polyglutamation, and therefore likely contributed to drug resistance and relapse in these cases. Thus, besides genomic alterations in thiopurine metabolizing enzymes, the relapse-specific mutations of FPGS represent another critical mechanism of acquired antimetabolite drug resistance in relapsed childhood ALL.","['Yu, Sung-Liang', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Ho, Bing-Ching', 'Yu, Chih-Hsiang', 'Chang, Chia-Ching', 'Hsu, Yin-Chen', 'Ni, Yu-Ling', 'Lin, Kai-Hsin', 'Jou, Shiann-Tarng', 'Lu, Meng-Yao', 'Chen, Shu-Huey', 'Wu, Kang-Hsi', 'Wang, Shih-Chung', 'Chang, Hsiu-Hao', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Yang, Jun J', 'Zhang, Jinghui', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn', 'Lin, Shu-Wha', 'Ma, Xiaotu', 'Yang, Yung-Li']","['Yu SL', 'Zhang H', 'Ho BC', 'Yu CH', 'Chang CC', 'Hsu YC', 'Ni YL', 'Lin KH', 'Jou ST', 'Lu MY', 'Chen SH', 'Wu KH', 'Wang SC', 'Chang HH', 'Pui CH', 'Yang JJ', 'Zhang J', 'Lin DT', 'Lin SW', 'Ma X', 'Yang YL']","['Centers of Genomic and Precision Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, No. 7, Chung Shan S.

To date, how certain chromatin architecture and subsequent transcription profile permit HSC quiescence remains unclear. Here, we show an essential role of chromatin remodeler zinc finger HIT-type containing 1 (Znhit1) in maintaining HSC quiescence. We find that loss of Znhit1 leads to exhaustion of stem cell pool and impairment of hematopoietic function. Mechanically, Znhit1 determines the chromatin accessibility at distal enhancers of HSC quiescence genes, including Pten, Fstl1, and Klf4, for sustained transcription and consequent PI3K-Akt signaling inhibition. Moreover, Znhit1-Pten-PI3K-Akt axis also participates in controlling myeloid expansion and B-lymphoid specification. Our findings therefore identify a dominant role of Znhit1-mediated chromatin remodeling in preserving HSC function for hematopoietic homeostasis.","['Sun, Shenfei', 'Jiang, Ning', 'Jiang, Yamei', 'He, Qiuping', 'He, Hua', 'Wang, Xin', 'Yang, Li', 'Li, Runsheng', 'Liu, Feng', 'Lin, Xinhua', 'Zhao, Bing']","['Sun S', 'Jiang N', 'Jiang Y', 'He Q', 'He H', 'Wang X', 'Yang L', 'Li R', 'Liu F', 'Lin X', 'Zhao B']","['State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Reproduction Regulation, Shanghai Institute of Planned Parenthood Research, Shanghai, 200032, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China.', 'National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Reproduction Regulation, Shanghai Institute of Planned Parenthood Research, Shanghai, 200032, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China. xlin@fudan.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200438, China. bingzhao@fudan.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Znhit1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Chromatin/metabolism/physiology', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",,,2020/07/23 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0988-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0988-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Dec;34(12):3348-3358. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0988-5.

What is more important, the fundamental mechanisms of hyperthyroidism after HSCT remained unclear. CASE: A 28-year-old man received an HLA haploidentical related-donor HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia and developed hyperthyroidism 31 months after HSCT. He presented with periodic paralysis as the initial symptom, his serum levels of free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and anti-thyroid autoantibodies increased, and thyroid-stimulating hormone level decreased. As a result, he was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Although systemic symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) were absent, thyroid histopathologic examination revealed thyroid follicular destruction and infiltrations of lymphocytes, which mainly consisted of CD20(+) B lymphocytes and CD4(+) and CD3(+) T lymphocytes by immunohistochemistry. These were in accordance with the pathologic features of GVHD. The symptom of periodic paralysis resolved after treatment with prednisolone and methimazole for 1 month. The treatments lasted for 4 months, and the plasma levels of fT3, fT4, TSH, and anti-thyroid peroxidase normalized. He did not relapse after drug withdrawal with observation for 24 months to date. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, the present case was the first to be confirmed with thyroid-specific GVHD-induced hyperthyroidism after allogeneic HSCT.","['Huang, Fen', 'Liao, Naying', 'Guan, Yuqing', 'Jin, Hua', 'Ye, Jieyu', 'Fan, Zhiping', 'Xuan, Li', 'Liu, Qifa', 'Shi, Pengcheng']","['Huang F', 'Liao N', 'Guan Y', 'Jin H', 'Ye J', 'Fan Z', 'Xuan L', 'Liu Q', 'Shi P']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.

CD5(+) DLBCL is classified as activated B-cell-like (ABC)/non-germinal-center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL with elusive genetic features, and patients are frequently characterized as being older and female, and as having Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status > 1, high International Prognostic Index score, tendency to develop B symptoms, and advanced-stage disease with high central nervous system relapse and bone marrow involvement rate. The mechanism underlying the poor prognosis in CD5(+) DLBCL has not been fully explored, and we summarize the reported potential mechanisms, including CD5-mediated B-cell receptor (BCR)-dependent and -independent pathways. The former involves the inhibition of BCR signaling, and the latter involves the BCR-independent overexpression of interleukin 10, Bcl-2 (antiapoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2), cyclin D2, and CXCR4 (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4). The efficacy of traditional regimen R-CHOP (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) is currently not satisfied in CD5(+) DLBCL. Therapies of larger doses, such as R-DA-EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin plus rituximab), R-ACVBP (rituximab plus doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, and prednisone), R-DA-EPOCH plus central nervous system prophylaxis, can improve the overall survival in CD5(+) DLBCL patients, while allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation still remains controversial as a salvage treatment. In addition, some novel drugs, such as lenalidomide, CXCR4 antagonists, Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Bcl-2 inhibitors, and immunotherapy, have been reported to have encouraging results and may improve the outcomes of these patients. In the present review, we comprehensively summarize the biology, mechanism, and treatment of CD5(+) DLBCL.","['Xu, Yichen', 'Sun, Wenjie', 'Li, Fei']","['Xu Y', 'Sun W', 'Li F']","['Joint Program of Nanchang University and Queen Mary University of London, Medical College of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Joint Program of Nanchang University and Queen Mary University of London, Medical College of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, China; Institute of Hematology, Jiangxi Academy of Clinical Medical Sciences, Nanchang, China.

Patients are at increased risk of thrombohemorrhagic events, and progression to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia. Current treatments include aspirin, phlebotomy, and cytoreductive drugs (most commonly hydroxyurea). Givinostat is a potent, class I/II histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that is in phase I/II clinical trials in PV. Givinostat was well tolerated and yielded promising clinico-hematological responses. A phase III study of givinostat versus hydroxyurea in high-risk PV patients is planned. AREAS COVERED: We present an overview of PV, current treatment guidelines, and the putative mechanism(s) of action of givinostat. We discuss the preclinical and clinical studies of givinostat in PV and briefly review approved and investigational competitor compounds. EXPERT OPINION: HDAC inhibitors have long been known to be active in PV, but chronic toxicities can be challenging. Givinostat, however, is active and well tolerated, and is entering a pivotal Phase III randomized trial. Givinostat offers the possibility of replacing hydroxyurea as the standard first-line cytoreductive choice for PV patients. This would completely change the current therapeutic paradigm and guidelines for PV management. Although surrogate clinical study endpoints may suffice for regulatory purposes, thrombosis reduction and prevention of disease progression remain most important to patients and clinicians.","['Chifotides, Helen T', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Chifotides HT', 'Bose P', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '5P60F84FBH (givinostat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbamates/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Disease Progression', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/*drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['JAK2 V617F', 'Clinical trial', 'HDAC', 'HSP90', 'epigenetic', 'givinostat', 'histone deacetylase inhibitor', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)', 'polycythemia vera (PV)']",2020/07/23 06:00,2021/01/28 06:00,['2020/07/23 06:00'],"['2020/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2020.1761323 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2020 Jun;29(6):525-536. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2020.1761323.

In particular, we and others reported recurrent germline ETV6 variants linked to ALL risk, which collectively represent a novel leukemia predisposition syndrome. To understand the influence of ETV6 variation on ALL pathogenesis, we comprehensively characterized a cohort of 32 childhood leukemia cases arising from this rare syndrome. Of 34 nonsynonymous germline ETV6 variants in ALL, we identified 22 variants with impaired transcription repressor activity, loss of DNA binding, and altered nuclear localization. Missense variants retained dimerization with wild-type ETV6 with potentially dominant-negative effects. Whole-transcriptome and whole-genome sequencing of this cohort of leukemia cases revealed a profound influence of germline ETV6 variants on leukemia transcriptional landscape, with distinct ALL subsets invoking unique patterns of somatic cooperating mutations. 70% of ALL cases with damaging germline ETV6 variants exhibited hyperdiploid karyotype with characteristic recurrent mutations in NRAS, KRAS, and PTPN11. In contrast, the remaining 30% cases had a diploid leukemia genome and an exceedingly high frequency of somatic copy-number loss of PAX5 and ETV6, with a gene expression pattern that strikingly mirrored that of ALL with somatic ETV6-RUNX1 fusion. Two ETV6 germline variants gave rise to both acute myeloid leukemia and ALL, with lineage-specific genetic lesions in the leukemia genomes. ETV6 variants compromise its tumor suppressor activity in vitro with specific molecular targets identified by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing profiling. ETV6-mediated ALL predisposition exemplifies the intricate interactions between inherited and acquired genomic variations in leukemia pathogenesis.","['Nishii, Rina', 'Baskin-Doerfler, Rebekah', 'Yang, Wentao', 'Oak, Ninad', 'Zhao, Xujie', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Hoshitsuki, Keito', 'Bloom, Mackenzie', 'Verbist, Katherine', 'Burns, Melissa', 'Li, Zhenhua', 'Lin, Ting-Nien', 'Qian, Maoxiang', 'Moriyama, Takaya', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Raetz, Elizabeth', 'Mullighan, Charles', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Yeoh, Allen Eng-Juh', 'Zhang, Jinghui', 'Metzger, Monika L', 'Klco, Jeffery M', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Newman, Scott', 'Wu, Gang', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Nichols, Kim E', 'Yang, Jun J']","['Nishii R', 'Baskin-Doerfler R', 'Yang W', 'Oak N', 'Zhao X', 'Yang W', 'Hoshitsuki K', 'Bloom M', 'Verbist K', 'Burns M', 'Li Z', 'Lin TN', 'Qian M', 'Moriyama T', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Rabin KR', 'Raetz E', 'Mullighan C', 'Pui CH', 'Yeoh AE', 'Zhang J', 'Metzger ML', 'Klco JM', 'Hunger SP', 'Newman S', 'Wu G', 'Loh ML', 'Nichols KE', 'Yang JJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Paediatrics, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', ""Children's Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China."", 'Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', ""Institute for Genomic Medicine, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH."", 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX."", 'Department of Pediatrics, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pathology and.', ""Hematological Malignancies Program, Comprehensive Cancer Center, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Hematological Malignancies Program, Comprehensive Cancer Center, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore."", 'VIVA-NUS Center for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Computational Biology and.', ""Hematological Malignancies Program, Comprehensive Cancer Center, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Global Pediatric Medicine, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Pathology and.', ""Hematological Malignancies Program, Comprehensive Cancer Center, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pediatrics and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Perelman School of Medicine at The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Department of Computational Biology and.', 'Department of Computational Biology and.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, CA;

A hallmark of GBM is aggressive invasion of tumor cells into the surrounding normal brain. Both the current standard of care and targeted therapies have largely failed to specifically address this issue. Therefore, identifying key regulators of GBM cell migration and invasion is important. The leukemia-associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG) has previously been implicated in cell invasion in other tumor types; however, its role in GBM pathobiology remains undefined. Herein, we report that the expression levels of LARG and ras homolog family members C (RhoC), and A (RhoA) increase with glial tumor grade and are highest in GBM. LARG and RhoC protein expression is more prominent in invading cells, whereas RhoA expression is largely restricted to cells in the tumor core. Knockdown of LARG by siRNA inhibits GBM cell migration in vitro and invasion ex vivo in organotypic brain slices. Moreover, siRNA-mediated silencing of RhoC suppresses GBM cell migration in vitro and invasion ex vivo, whereas depletion of RhoA enhances GBM cell migration and invasion, supporting a role for LARG and RhoC in GBM cell migration and invasion. Depletion of LARG increases the sensitivity of GBM cells to temozolomide treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that LARG and RhoC may represent unappreciated targets to inhibit glioma invasion.","['Ding, Zonghui', 'Dong, Zhiwan', 'Yang, Yuping', 'Fortin Ensign, Shannon P', 'Sabit, Hemragul', 'Nakada, Mitsutoshi', 'Ruggieri, Rosamaria', 'Kloss, Jean M', 'Symons, Marc', 'Tran, Nhan L', 'Loftus, Joseph C']","['Ding Z', 'Dong Z', 'Yang Y', 'Fortin Ensign SP', 'Sabit H', 'Nakada M', 'Ruggieri R', 'Kloss JM', 'Symons M', 'Tran NL', 'Loftus JC']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Karches Center for Oncology Research, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research at Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York.', 'Karches Center for Oncology Research, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research at Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Karches Center for Oncology Research, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research at Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona.', 'Karches Center for Oncology Research, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research at Northwell Health, Manhasset, New York.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona; Department of Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, Arizona.

CD19-targeted immunotherapy is effective against MRD but is logistically challenging, potentially toxic, and not applicable to T-cell ALL. We thus hypothesized that inhibition of PD-1 with pembrolizumab could also be effective for MRD, but without lineage restriction. The primary objective of this phase 2 study was to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with ALL and MRD. Key eligibility criteria included adults with B- or T-cell ALL and MRD detectable by multiparameter flow cytometry or quantitative polymerase chain reaction from bone marrow aspirate (BMA) despite chemotherapy (plus ABL kinase inhibitor if Philadelphia chromosome positive). Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV was given every 3 weeks. Response was assessed by BMA using methods that previously detected MRD. The primary end point was complete MRD response rate. We stopped enrollment early; only 1 of 12 (8%) experienced a complete MRD response, which lasted 3 weeks. Interestingly, this patient had previously received hematopoietic cell transplantation and CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell therapy and was the only patient to experience an immune-related adverse event from pembrolizumab (grade 3 Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Median overall survival from enrollment was 12.7 months. In summary, pembrolizumab had minimal activity against MRD but was generally well tolerated. These data can be compared with ongoing anti-PD-1 combination studies in ALL, and they further establish the role of trials specifically for patients with MRD.

Whether properties of the host immune response impact disease risk and outcome is not known. Here, we combine mass cytometry, single cell genomics, and functional studies to characterize the BM immune environment in children with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia at presentation. T cells in leukemia marrow demonstrate evidence of chronic immune activation and exhaustion/dysfunction, with attrition of naive T cells and TCF1+ stem-like memory T cells and accumulation of terminally differentiated effector T cells. Marrow-infiltrating NK cells also exhibit evidence of dysfunction, particularly in myeloid leukemia. Properties of immune cells identified distinct immune phenotype-based clusters correlating with disease risk in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. High-risk immune signatures were associated with expression of stem-like genes on tumor cells. These data provide a comprehensive assessment of the immune landscape of childhood leukemias and identify targets potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention. These studies also suggest that properties of the host response with depletion of naive T cells and accumulation of terminal-effector T cells may contribute to the biologic basis of disease risk.

The species Paenibacillus massiliensis and Paenibacillus panacisoli are Gram-stain-positive and endospore-forming bacilli isolated from a blood culture of a leukemia patient and from soil of a ginseng field, respectively. Comparative analyses of their 16S rRNA genes revealed that the two Paenibacillus species could be synonyms (99.3% sequence identity). In the present study we performed different genomic analyses in order to evaluate the phylogenetic relationship of these micro-organisms. Paenibacillus massiliensis DSM 16942(T) and P. panacisoli DSM 21345(T) presented a difference in their G+C content lower than 1 mol%, overall genome relatedness index values higher than the species circumscription thresholds (average nucleotide identity, 95.57 %; genome-wide ANI, =96.51 %; and orthologous ANI, 96.25 %), and a monophyletic grouping pattern in the phylogenies of the 16S rRNA gene and the proteome core.

Clinical outcomes for patients with hematologic malignancies have improved significantly since the approval of immunotherapeutic and targeted therapies. These new treatments have had an impact on overall outcomes and have helped determine the design for translational research and future trials. Although most of these novel drugs called ""innovators"" are initially approved and marketed in the United States, several have also become available in countries such as India. With the expiration of patents, generic versions of innovator drugs have increased and accessibility has improved for patients. The advent of biosimilars is another route for expanding access to biologic compounds. As a result, the development costs for developing these drugs are lower, and consequently, the costs for the patient are often lower. Although the delivery of cancer care is not the same in India as it is in the United States, the introduction of biosimilars and generics has helped bridge the gap. This has made treatment of CLL and lymphoma similar in both countries and has had the same impact on patient outcomes and quality of life. Compulsory licensing for essential medications, as stipulated by the Doha Declaration, and capping of drug prices could improve global access to treatments for CLL and lymphoma.","['Sathyanarayanan, Vishwanath', 'Flowers, Christopher R', 'Iyer, Swaminathan P']","['Sathyanarayanan V', 'Flowers CR', 'Iyer SP']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Apollo Hospitals, Bangalore, India.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,JCO Glob Oncol,JCO global oncology,101760170,"['0 (Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)']",IM,"['*Biosimilar Pharmaceuticals/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'India', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', '*Lymphoma/drug therapy', '*Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of Life', 'United States']",,,2020/07/22 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/07/22 06:00'],"['2020/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/GO.20.00012 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Glob Oncol. 2020 Jul;6:1124-1133. doi: 10.1200/GO.20.00012.,,,,,,PMC7392782,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, CD123 is preferentially overexpressed in leukemia stem cells (LSC) in contrast to normal hematopoietic stem cells, and this differential expression allows for the selective eradication of LSC and leukemic blasts through therapeutic targeting of CD123, with less impact on hematopoietic cells. The level of CD123 expression in AML correlates with both treatment response and outcomes. Therefore, targeting CD123 represents a promising universal therapeutic target in advanced acute leukemias irrespective of the individual leukemia phenotype. There are currently 31 ongoing clinical trials examining the utility of CD123-based targeted therapies. Here we focus our review on current efforts to target CD123 in acute leukemia through various therapeutic constructs.","['Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Clark, Mary', 'Song, Joo Y', 'Pullarkat, Vinod']","['Aldoss I', 'Clark M', 'Song JY', 'Pullarkat V']","['Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center , Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Clinical and Translational Project Development, City of Hope National Medical Center , Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center , Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center , Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,101572652,"['0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*AML', '*BPDCN', '*CD123', '*Il3', '*bispecific antibody', '*flotetuzumab', '*tagraxofusp']",2020/07/22 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/07/22 06:00'],"['2020/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/21645515.2020.1788299 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2020 Oct 2;16(10):2341-2348. doi: 10.1080/21645515.2020.1788299.

The number of SSCs is rare, which makes the separation and enrichment of SSCs difficult and inefficient. The transcription factor PAX7 maintains fertility in normal spermatogenesis in mice. However, for large animals, much less is known about the SSCs' self-renewal regulation, especially in dairy goats. We isolated and enriched the CD49f-positive and negative dairy goat testicular cells by magnetic-activated cell sorting strategies. The RNA- sequencing and experimental data revealed that cells with a high CD49f and PAX7 expression are undifferentiated spermatogonia in goat testis. Our findings indicated that ZBTB16 (PLZF), PAX7, LIN28A, BMPR1B, FGFR1, and FOXO1 were expressed higher in CD49f-positive cells as compared to negative cells and goat fibroblasts cells. The expression and distribution of PAX7 in dairy goat also have been detected, which gradually decreased in testis tissue along with the increasing age. When the PAX7 gene was overexpressed in dairy goat immortal mGSCs-I-SB germ cell lines, the expression of PLZF, GFRalpha1, ID4, and OCT4 was upregulated. Together, our data demonstrated that there is a subset of spermatogonial stem cells with a high expression of PAX7 among the CD49f(+) spermatogonia, and PAX7 can maintain the self-renewal of CD49f-positive SSCs.","['Du, Xiaomin', 'Wu, Siyu', 'Wei, Yudong', 'Yu, Xiuwei', 'Ma, Fanglin', 'Zhai, Yuanxin', 'Yang, Donghui', 'Zhang, Mengfei', 'Liu, Wenqing', 'Zhu, Haijing', 'Wu, Jiang', 'Liao, Mingzhi', 'Li, Na', 'Bai, Chunling', 'Li, Guangpeng', 'Hua, Jinlian']","['Du X', 'Wu S', 'Wei Y', 'Yu X', 'Ma F', 'Zhai Y', 'Yang D', 'Zhang M', 'Liu W', 'Zhu H', 'Wu J', 'Liao M', 'Li N', 'Bai C', 'Li G', 'Hua J']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'Life Science Research Center, Yulin University, Yulin, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Agriculture, Guangdong Ocean University, Zhanjiang, China.', 'College of Life Science, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Mammalian Reproductive Biology and Biotechnology, Ministry of Education, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Mammalian Reproductive Biology and Biotechnology, Ministry of Education, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Integrin alpha6)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (PAX7 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Self Renewal/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics', 'Goats/genetics/growth & development', 'Integrin alpha6/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'PAX7 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/genetics', 'Spermatogenesis/*genetics', 'Spermatogonia/growth & development', 'Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Testis/*growth & development/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CD49f', '*PAX7', '*self-renewal', '*spermatogonial stem cells']",2020/07/22 06:00,2021/09/08 06:00,['2020/07/22 06:00'],"['2019/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.29954 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2021 Feb;236(2):1481-1493. doi: 10.1002/jcp.29954.

However, the resistance to BET inhibitors in leukemia stem cells limits its implication in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). High concentration of triptolide (TPL) presents anticancer activities but with adverse effects. Here, we investigated whether the combination of low-dose TPL with JQ1 could help to circumvent the dilemma of drug resistance and side effect in treating AML. AML cell lines, primary cells from 10 AML patients with different status, as well as AML mice model were subjected to different treatments and apoptotic related protein expression were evaluated. Data showed that low-dose TPL combined with JQ1 effectively killed AML cell lines and primary cells from AML patients without exerting significantly greater lethal activity against normal cells. Mechanism study revealed that low-dose TPL combined with JQ1 triggered reactive oxygen species production and induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in AML cells, in which the inhibition of RNA polymerase II to downregulate c-Myc was mainly responsible for the enhanced activity of TPL in combination with JQ1. In vivo study presented that cotreatment with low-dose TPL and JQ1 significantly reduced tumor burden of the NOD/SCID mice engrafted with MOLM-13 cells. In conclusion, low-dose TPL enhanced the antitumor effect of JQ1 on AML without increasing the side effects, supporting a potential option for AML treatment.","['Shi, Yuanfei', 'Zhao, Haijun', 'Ye,

METHODS: The expression of protein phosphatase, Mg(2+)/Mn(2+) dependent 1D was detected in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines including SKM-1, KG-1, AML-193, and THP-1 cells, and normal bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from healthy donors. The knockdown of protein phosphatase, Mg(2+)/Mn(2+) dependent 1D was conducted by transfecting small interfering RNA into AML-193 cells and KG-1 cells. RESULTS: The relative messenger RNA/protein expressions of protein phosphatase, Mg(2+)/Mn(2+) dependent 1D were higher in SKM-1, KG-1, AML-193, and THP-1 cells compared with control cells (normal bone marrow mononuclear cells). After transfecting protein phosphatase, Mg(2+)/Mn(2+) dependent 1D small interfering RNA into AML-193 cells and KG-1 cells, both messenger RNA and protein expressions of protein phosphatase, Mg(2+)/Mn(2+) dependent 1D were significantly reduced, indicating the successful transfection. Most importantly, knockdown of protein phosphatase, Mg(2+)/Mn(2+) dependent 1D suppressed cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in AML-193 cells and KG-1 cells. In addition, knockdown of protein phosphatase, Mg(2+)/Mn(2+) dependent 1D enhanced the expressions of p-p38 and p53 in AML-193 cells and KG-1 cells. The above observation suggested that protein phosphatase, Mg(2+)/Mn(2+) dependent 1D knockdown suppressed cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis, and activated p38 MAPK/p53 signaling pathway in acute myeloid leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: Protein phosphatase, Mg(2+)/Mn(2+) dependent 1D is implicated in acute myeloid leukemia carcinogenesis, which illuminates its potential role as a treatment target for acute myeloid leukemia.","['Li, Bin', 'Hu, Jie', 'He, Di', 'Chen, Qi', 'Liu, Suna', 'Zhu, Xiaoling', 'Yu, Meijia']","['Li B', 'Hu J', 'He D', 'Chen Q', 'Liu S', 'Zhu X', 'Yu M']","[""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Yunnan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Yunnan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Yunnan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Yunnan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Yunnan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Yunnan, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Yunnan, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,Technology in cancer research & treatment,101140941,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPM1D protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2C)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2C/*genetics', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*PPM1D', '*apoptosis', '*p38 MAPK/p53 signaling pathway', '*proliferation']",2020/07/22 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2020/07/22 06:00'],"['2020/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1533033820942312 [doi]'],ppublish,Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2020 Jan-Dec;19:1533033820942312. doi: 10.1177/1533033820942312.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9370-3773'],,,,,PMC7375723,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence rates of adverse reactions in SFI combined with chemotherapy group were significantly lower than that of the chemotherapy alone group (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Shenqi Fuzheng Injection combined with chemotherapy has good efficacy and safety for AL, and it can alleviate the adverse reactions caused by chemotherapy. However, subject to the limitations of the methodological quality of the literature, the conclusions of this study need to be further verified by large-scale and multi-center RCTs.","['Meng, Fu-Xue', 'Yang, Xin', 'Li, Mei-Ling']","['Meng FX', 'Yang X', 'Li ML']","['Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Duyun, Guizhou Province, 558000, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Duyun, Guizhou Province, 558000, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Duyun, Guizhou Province, 558000, China. limeiling666@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",China,Chin J Integr Med,Chinese journal of integrative medicine,101181180,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (shenqi fuzheng)']",IM,"['*Drugs, Chinese Herbal/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Injections', '*Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chinese medicine', 'Shenqi Fuzheng Injection', 'acute leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'hemotherapy', 'meta-analysis']",2020/07/22 06:00,2021/12/31 06:00,['2020/07/22 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11655-020-3264-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s11655-020-3264-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin J Integr Med. 2022 Jan;28(1):81-87. doi: 10.1007/s11655-020-3264-7.

The identification of host factors involved in ZIKV replication may guide efficacious therapeutic interventions. In genome-wide transcriptional studies, we found that ZIKV infection triggers aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation. Specifically, ZIKV infection induces kynurenine (Kyn) production, which activates AHR, limiting the production of type I interferons (IFN-I) involved in antiviral immunity. Moreover, ZIKV-triggered AHR activation suppresses intrinsic immunity driven by the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, which limits ZIKV replication. AHR inhibition suppressed the replication of multiple ZIKV strains in vitro and also suppressed replication of the related flavivirus dengue. Finally, AHR inhibition with a nanoparticle-delivered AHR antagonist or an inhibitor developed for human use limited ZIKV replication and ameliorated newborn microcephaly in a murine model. In summary, we identified AHR as a host factor for ZIKV replication and PML protein as a driver of anti-ZIKV intrinsic immunity.","['Giovannoni, Federico', 'Bosch, Irene', 'Polonio, Carolina Manganeli', 'Torti, Maria F', 'Wheeler, Michael A', 'Li, Zhaorong', 'Romorini, Leonardo', 'Rodriguez Varela, Maria S', 'Rothhammer, Veit', 'Barroso, Andreia', 'Tjon, Emily C', 'Sanmarco, Liliana M', 'Takenaka, Maisa C', 'Modaresi, Seyed Mohamad Sadegh', 'Gutierrez-Vazquez, Cristina', 'Zanluqui, Nagela Ghabdan', 'Dos Santos, Nilton Barreto', 'Munhoz, Carolina Demarchi', 'Wang, Zhongyan', 'Damonte, Elsa B', 'Sherr, David', 'Gehrke, Lee', 'Peron, Jean Pierre Schatzmann', 'Garcia, Cybele C', 'Quintana, Francisco J']","['Giovannoni F', 'Bosch I', 'Polonio CM', 'Torti MF', 'Wheeler MA', 'Li Z', 'Romorini L', 'Rodriguez Varela MS', 'Rothhammer V', 'Barroso A', 'Tjon EC', 'Sanmarco LM', 'Takenaka MC', 'Modaresi SMS', 'Gutierrez-Vazquez C', 'Zanluqui NG', 'Dos Santos NB', 'Munhoz CD', 'Wang Z', 'Damonte EB', 'Sherr D', 'Gehrke L', 'Peron JPS', 'Garcia CC', 'Quintana FJ']","[""Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Laboratorio de Estrategias Antivirales, Departamento de Quimica Biologica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires.

Here, we show that the late HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu hijacks DNA repair mechanisms to promote degradation of nuclear viral cDNA in cells that are already productively infected. Vpu achieves this by interacting with RanBP2-RanGAP1*SUMO1-Ubc9 SUMO E3-ligase complexes at the nuclear pore to reprogramme promyelocytic leukaemia protein nuclear bodies and reduce SUMOylation of Bloom syndrome protein, unleashing end degradation of viral cDNA. Concomitantly, Vpu inhibits RAD52-mediated homologous repair of viral cDNA, preventing the generation of dead-end circular forms of single copies of the long terminal repeat and permitting sustained nucleolytic attack. Our results identify Vpu as a key modulator of the DNA repair machinery. We show that Bloom syndrome protein eliminates nuclear HIV-1 cDNA and thereby suppresses immune sensing and proviral hyper-integration. Therapeutic targeting of DNA repair may facilitate the induction of antiviral immunity and suppress proviral integration replenishing latent HIV reservoirs.","['Volcic, Meta', 'Sparrer, Konstantin M J', 'Koepke, Lennart', 'Hotter, Dominik', 'Sauter, Daniel', 'Sturzel, Christina M', 'Scherer, Myriam', 'Stamminger, Thomas', 'Hofmann, Thomas G', 'Arhel, Nathalie J', 'Wiesmuller, Lisa', 'Kirchhoff, Frank']","['Volcic M', 'Sparrer KMJ', 'Koepke L', 'Hotter D', 'Sauter D', 'Sturzel CM', 'Scherer M', 'Stamminger T', 'Hofmann TG', 'Arhel NJ', 'Wiesmuller L', 'Kirchhoff F']","['Division of Gynecological Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Virology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Epigenetics, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Toxicology, University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', ""Centre d'etudes d'agents Pathogenes et Biotechnologies pour la Sante (CPBS) CNRS FRE3689, Montpellier University, Montpellier, France."", 'Division of Gynecological Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany. lisa.wiesmueller@uni-ulm.de.', 'Institute of Molecular Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany. frank.kirchhoff@uni-ulm.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Microbiol,Nature microbiology,101674869,"['0 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins)', '0 (Rad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Protein)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (vpu protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)']",IM,"['*DNA Repair', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HIV Infections/genetics/immunology/*virology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions/genetics/immunology', 'Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Models, Biological', 'Rad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Protein/metabolism', 'Recombinational DNA Repair', 'Sumoylation', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins/*metabolism', '*Virus Integration']",,,2020/07/22 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/07/22 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41564-020-0753-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41564-020-0753-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Microbiol. 2020 Oct;5(10):1247-1261. doi: 10.1038/s41564-020-0753-6.

What other functions pDCs exert in vivo during viral infections is controversial, and more studies are needed to understand their orchestration. In the present study, we characterize in depth and link pDC activation states in animals infected by mouse cytomegalovirus by combining Ifnb1 reporter mice with flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, confocal microscopy and a cognate CD4 T cell activation assay. We show that IFN-I production and T cell activation were performed by the same pDC, but these occurred sequentially in time and in different micro-anatomical locations. In addition, we show that pDC commitment to IFN-I production was marked early on by their downregulation of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor and was promoted by cell-intrinsic tumor necrosis factor signaling. We propose a new model for how individual pDCs are endowed to exert different functions in vivo during a viral infection, in a manner tightly orchestrated in time and space.","['Abbas, Abdenour', 'Vu Manh, Thien-Phong', 'Valente, Michael', 'Collinet, Nils', 'Attaf, Noudjoud', 'Dong, Chuang', 'Naciri, Karima', 'Chelbi, Rabie', 'Brelurut, Geoffray', 'Cervera-Marzal, Inaki', 'Rauwel, Benjamin', 'Davignon, Jean-Luc', 'Bessou, Gilles', 'Thomas-Chollier, Morgane', 'Thieffry, Denis', 'Villani, Alexandra-Chloe', 'Milpied, Pierre', 'Dalod, Marc', 'Tomasello, Elena']","['Abbas A', 'Vu Manh TP', 'Valente M', 'Collinet N', 'Attaf N', 'Dong C', 'Naciri K', 'Chelbi R', 'Brelurut G', 'Cervera-Marzal I', 'Rauwel B', 'Davignon JL', 'Bessou G', 'Thomas-Chollier M', 'Thieffry D', 'Villani AC', 'Milpied P', 'Dalod M', 'Tomasello E']","[""Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, CIML, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Turing Center for Living Systems, Marseille, France."", 'Institut Curie, PSL Research University, Paris, France.', ""Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, CIML, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Turing Center for Living Systems, Marseille, France."", ""Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, CIML, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Turing Center for Living Systems, Marseille, France."", ""Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, CIML, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Turing Center for Living Systems, Marseille, France."", ""Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, CIML, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Turing Center for Living Systems, Marseille, France."", ""Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, CIML, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Turing Center for Living Systems, Marseille, France."", ""Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, CIML, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Turing Center for Living Systems, Marseille, France."", ""Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, CIML, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Turing Center for Living Systems, Marseille, France."", ""Institut de Biologie de l'ENS, Departement de biologie, Ecole normale superieure, CNRS, INSERM, Universite PSL, Paris, France."", ""Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, CIML, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Turing Center for Living Systems, Marseille, France."", 'Eura Nova, Marseille, France.', 'Centre de Physiopathologie Toulouse Purpan, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Physiopathologie Toulouse Purpan, Toulouse, France.', ""Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, CIML, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Turing Center for Living Systems, Marseille, France."", ""Institut de Biologie de l'ENS, Departement de biologie, Ecole normale superieure, CNRS, INSERM, Universite PSL, Paris, France."", ""Institut de Biologie de l'ENS, Departement de biologie, Ecole normale superieure, CNRS, INSERM, Universite PSL, Paris, France."", 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Center for Immunology and Inflammatory Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, CIML, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Turing Center for Living Systems, Marseille, France."", ""Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, CIML, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Turing Center for Living Systems, Marseille, France. dalod@ciml.univ-mrs.fr."", ""Aix-Marseille University, CNRS, INSERM, CIML, Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Turing Center for Living Systems, Marseille, France. tomasell@ciml.univ-mrs.fr.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Immunol,Nature immunology,100941354,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Interferon Type I/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Muromegalovirus/*physiology', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,,2020/07/22 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/07/22 06:00'],"['2019/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41590-020-0731-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41590-020-0731-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Immunol. 2020 Sep;21(9):983-997. doi: 10.1038/s41590-020-0731-4.

Nonetheless, its physiological roles remain elusive. Here, we sought to develop small-molecule NUDT15 inhibitors to elucidate its biological functions and potentially to improve NUDT15-dependent chemotherapeutics. Lead compound TH1760 demonstrated low-nanomolar biochemical potency through direct and specific binding into the NUDT15 catalytic pocket and engaged cellular NUDT15 in the low-micromolar range. We also employed thiopurine potentiation as a proxy functional readout and demonstrated that TH1760 sensitized cells to 6-thioguanine through enhanced accumulation of 6-thio-(d)GTP in nucleic acids. A biochemically validated, inactive structural analog, TH7285, confirmed that increased thiopurine toxicity takes place via direct NUDT15 inhibition. In conclusion, TH1760 represents the first chemical probe for interrogating NUDT15 biology and potential therapeutic avenues.","['Zhang, Si Min', 'Desroses, Matthieu', 'Hagenkort, Anna', 'Valerie,

However, RTs have proven challenging to discover and engineer, in particular for the more divergent XNA chemistries. Here we describe a general strategy for the directed evolution of RT function for any template chemistry called compartmentalized bead labelling and demonstrate it by the directed evolution of efficient RTs for 2'-O-methyl RNA and hexitol nucleic acids and the discovery of RTs for the orphan XNA chemistries D-altritol nucleic acid and 2'-methoxyethyl RNA, for which previously no RTs existed. Finally, we describe the engineering of XNA RTs with active exonucleolytic proofreading as well as the directed evolution of RNA RTs with very high complementary DNA synthesis fidelities, even in the absence of proofreading.","['Houlihan, Gillian', 'Arangundy-Franklin, Sebastian', 'Porebski, Benjamin T', 'Subramanian, Nithya', 'Taylor, Alexander I', 'Holliger, Philipp']","['Houlihan G', 'Arangundy-Franklin S', 'Porebski BT', 'Subramanian N', 'Taylor AI', 'Holliger P']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease (CITIID), Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK. ph1@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Chem,Nature chemistry,101499734,"['63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Library', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2020/07/22 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/07/22 06:00'],"['2019/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41557-020-0502-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41557-020-0502-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Chem. 2020 Aug;12(8):683-690. doi: 10.1038/s41557-020-0502-8.

These structures allow for long-range interactions of DNA elements, such as the association of promoters with their cognate enhancers. In recent years, mutations in genes that control these structures, including the cohesin-complex and the insulator-binding protein CTCF, have been found in a spectrum of hematologic disorders, and especially in acute leukemias. Cohesin and CTCF are critical for mediating looping and establishing boundaries within chromatin. Cells that harbor mutations in these genes display aberrant chromatin architecture and resulting differences in gene expression that contribute to leukemia initiation and progression. Here, we provide detailed discussion of the nature of 3D interactions and the way that they are disrupted in acute leukemia. Continued research in this area will provide new insights into the mechanisms of leukemogenesis and may shed light on novel treatment strategies.","['Fang, Celestia', 'Rao, Sridhar', 'Crispino, John D', 'Ntziachristos, Panagiotis']","['Fang C', 'Rao S', 'Crispino JD', 'Ntziachristos P']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Versiti Blood Research Institute, Milwaukee, WI, 53226, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA. j-crispino@northwestern.edu.', 'Division of Hematology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA. j-crispino@northwestern.edu.', 'Simpson Querrey Center for Epigenetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA. j-crispino@northwestern.edu.', 'Robert H.

In medical practice, the quality of the hematopoietic graft is based on CD34(+) cell content that is used to define ""Good Mobilizer (GM)"" or ""Poor Mobilizer (PM)"" patients but does not report the real HSC content of grafts. In this study, we assessed the HSC content within the CD34(+) fraction of graft samples from 3 groups of patients: 1-GM patients receiving G-CSF only (GM(G-CSF)), 2-PM patients receiving G-CSF only (PM(G-CSF)), 3-PM patients receiving G-CSF + Plerixafor (PM(G-CSF+P)). Although HSC from the 3 groups of patients displayed very similar phenotypic profiles, expression of ""stemness"" genes and metabolic characteristics, their capacity to engraft NSG mice differed revealing differences in terms of HSC between groups. Indeed according to mobilization regimen, we observed differences in migration capacity of HSC, as well as differences in engraftment intensity depending on the initial pathology (myeloma versus lymphoma) of patients. This suggests that mobilization regimen could strongly influence the long term engraftment efficiency of hematopoietic grafts.","['Mombled, Margaux', 'Rodriguez, Laura', 'Avalon, Maryse', 'Duchez, Pascale', 'Vlaski-Lafarge, Marija', 'Debeissat, Christelle', 'Perard, Baptiste', 'Sawai, Katherine M', 'Pasquet, Jean Max', 'Bijou, Fontanet', 'Thevenot, Florian', 'Cabantous, Txomin', 'Ivanovic, Zoran', 'Brunet de la Grange, Philippe']","['Mombled M', 'Rodriguez L', 'Avalon M', 'Duchez P', 'Vlaski-Lafarge M', 'Debeissat C', 'Perard B', 'Sawai KM', 'Pasquet JM', 'Bijou F', 'Thevenot F', 'Cabantous T', 'Ivanovic Z', 'Brunet de la Grange P']","['French Blood Institute, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U1035, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'French Blood Institute, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U1035, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'French Blood Institute, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U1035, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'French Blood Institute, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U1035, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'French Blood Institute, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U1035, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U1035, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'French Blood Institute, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U1218, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U1035, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', 'French Blood Institute, Bordeaux, France.', 'French Blood Institute, Bordeaux, France.', 'French Blood Institute, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM U1035, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'French Blood Institute, Bordeaux, France. philippe.brunet-de-la-grange@efs.sante.fr.', 'INSERM U1035, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France. philippe.brunet-de-la-grange@efs.sante.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Cyclams)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'S915P5499N (plerixafor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Benzylamines', 'Child', 'Cyclams', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism']",,,2020/07/22 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/07/22 06:00'],"['2020/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0982-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0982-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Dec;34(12):3370-3381. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0982-y.

Relapsed APL is resistant to subsequent chemotherapy. Novel agents are in need to kill APL cells selectively with minimal toxicity. DDX5 has been recognized to be a novel target to suppress acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the role of DDX5 remains elusive in APL. Here a DDX5-targeting fully human monoclonal autoantibody named after 2F5 was prepared. It is demonstrated that 2F5 selectively inhibited APL cell proliferation without toxicity to normal neutrophil and tissues. Moreover, 2F5 was confirmed to induce G0/G1 phase arrest in APL cells, and promote APL cell differentiation combined with decreased DDX5 expression and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Knockdown of DDX5 by siRNA also inhibited proliferation, promoted cell differentiation and enhanced ROS production in APL cells. However, the ROS inhibitor reversed the effects of 2F5 on DDX5 and ROS in APL cells. Thus, we conclude that DDX5-targeting 2F5 inhibits APL cell proliferation, and promotes cell differentiation via induction of ROS. 2F5 showed the therapeutic value of fully human monoclonal autoantibody in APL, which provides a novel and valid approach for treatment of relapse/refractory APL.","['Wu, Jing', 'You, Yan-Qiu', 'Ma, Yan-Xiu', 'Kang, Yan-Hua', 'Wu, Tian', 'Wu, Xiang-Ji', 'Hu, Xiao-Xiao', 'Meng, Qiao-Hong', 'Huang, Yin', 'Zhang, Na', 'Pan, Xiao-Ben']","['Wu J', 'You YQ', 'Ma YX', 'Kang YH', 'Wu T', 'Wu XJ', 'Hu XX', 'Meng QH', 'Huang Y', 'Zhang N', 'Pan XB']","['Department of Basic Medicine of Medical School, Department of Infectious Diseases of Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Liver and Metabolic Diseases, Key Laboratory of Aging and Cancer Biology of Zhejiang Province, and Key Laboratory of Inflammation and Immunoregulation of Hangzhou, Hangzhou Normal University, 310000, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, P.R.

Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is its main complication and hampers survival. There is strong evidence that intestinal microbiota diversity of the recipient may increase the risk of GVHD worsening survival. Antibiotic regimens used during the early phase of the transplant may influence clinical outcomes by reducing intestinal microbiota diversity. Present guidelines of European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia exhort to optimising antibiotic use in haematological patients including HSCT recipients. The present study aims to investigate if, in HSCT recipients, the optimisation of antibacterial use may preserve intestinal microbiota composition reducing the incidence and severity of acute GVHD and improving relevant clinical outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospective longitudinal observational study of two cohorts of HSCT recipients: (1) the intervention cohort includes patients treated in centres in which a predefined strategy of antibiotherapy optimisation is implemented, with the objective of optimising and reducing antibiotic administration according to clinical criteria and (2) the control cohort includes patients treated in centres in which a classic permissive strategy of antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment is used. Adult patient receiving a first HSCT as a treatment for any haematological condition are included. Clinical variables are prospectively recorded and up to five faecal samples are collected for microbiota characterisation at prestablished peritransplant time points. Patients are followed since the preconditioning phase throughout 1-year post-transplant and four follow-up visits are scheduled. Faecal microbiota composition and diversity will be compared between both cohorts along with acute GVHD incidence and severity, severe infections rate, mortality and overall and disease-free survival. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved between 2017 and 2018 by the Ethical Committees of participant centres. Study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and national and international scientific conferences.

YY1 has previously been implicated in the transcriptional silencing of many retroviruses by binding to DNA sequences in the U3 region of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). We here show that YY1 overexpression leads to profound activation, rather than repression, of human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) expression, while YY1 down-regulation reduces HTLV-1 expression. The YY1 responsive element mapped not to YY1 DNA-binding sites in the HTLV-1 LTR but to the R region. The HTLV-1 R sequence alone is sufficient to provide YY1 responsiveness to a nonresponsive promoter, but only in the sense orientation and only when included as part of the mRNA. YY1 binds to the R region of HTLV-1 RNA in vitro and in vivo, leading to increased transcription initiation and elongation. The findings indicate that YY1 is a potent transactivator of HTLV-1 gene expression acting via binding viral RNA, rather than DNA.","['Wang, Gary Z', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Wang GZ', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032; spg1@cumc.columbia.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (YY1 Transcription Factor)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'RNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics', '*YY1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*RNA binding', '*human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)', '*transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1)', '*transcriptional activation']",2020/07/22 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2020/07/22 06:00'],"['2020/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['2005726117 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.2005726117 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Aug 4;117(31):18701-18710. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2005726117.

Incorporation of prognostic and druggable genetic biomarkers into clinical practice to guide patient-specific treatment is going to be the mainstay in AML therapeutics. Since 2017 there has been an explosion of novel treatment options to tailor personalized therapy for AML patients. In the past 3 years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a total of eight drugs for the treatment of AML; most specifically target certain gene mutations, biological pathways, or surface antigen. These novel agents are especially beneficial for older patients or those with comorbidities, in whom the treatment choice is limited and the clinical outcome is very poor.

Voriconazole, a new generation of triazole, has shown excellent results in treating invasive fungal infections. CASE REPORT: Herein, we report two cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which induced after voriconazole exposure.Management and outcome: Magnetic resonance imaging, and the serum level of voriconazole were investigated in both patients to assess toxicity. The role of methotrexate, as one of the possible causes of PRES, is weakened significantly through precise assessing diffusion-weighted images on magnetic resonance imaging. DISCUSSION: These unique cases emphasize that voriconazole can induce PRES even at therapeutic levels. Therefore, in the case of neurotoxicity, PRES must be considered, and voriconazole should discontinue. The prognosis seemed promising when voriconazole stopped immediately after clinical suspicion.","['Amanati, Ali', 'Lotfi, Mehrzad', 'Manen, Rob Van', 'Faghihi, Mohammad Ali', 'Yavarian, Majid', 'Zekavat, Omidreza', 'Badiee, Parisa', 'Mazinani, Nazafarin Hatami', 'Bozorgi, Haleh']","['Amanati A', 'Lotfi M', 'Manen RV', 'Faghihi MA', 'Yavarian M', 'Zekavat O', 'Badiee P', 'Mazinani NH', 'Bozorgi H']","['Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Medical Imaging Research Center, Department of Radiology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Oracle Health Sciences, Kattendijke, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Therapeutic Innovation and Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Persian BayanGene Research and Training Center, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Persian BayanGene Research and Training Center, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Mycoses/complications/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Voriconazole/*adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use', 'Wilms Tumor/complications/drug therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['Voriconazole', 'invasive fungal infections', 'malignancy', 'posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome']",2020/07/22 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/07/22 06:00'],"['2020/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155220941590 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2021 Mar;27(2):498-504. doi: 10.1177/1078155220941590.

This very rare syndrome has been reported in only 14 patients worldwide. A number of clinical signs have been reported, including joint contractures, muscle atrophy, microcytic anemia, and panniculitis-induced childhood lipodystrophy. Additional symptoms include recurrent fevers, purpuric skin lesions, periorbital erythema, and failure to thrive. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of periodontal manifestations associated with CANDLE syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: An 11-year-old boy was referred to Cork University Dental School and Hospital, Cork, Ireland, with evidence of severe periodontal breakdown. The patient's medical condition was managed in Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, London, United Kingdom. The patient's dental management included initial treatment to remove teeth of hopeless prognosis, followed by prosthodontic rehabilitation using removable partial dentures. This was followed by additional non-surgical periodontal treatment and maintenance. In the long term, the potential definitive restorative options, including dental implants, will be evaluated in discussion with the patient's medical team. CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease is one of seven categories of periodontitis as defined by the American Academy of Periodontology 1999 classification system. A number of systemic diseases have been associated with advanced periodontal breakdown, including diabetes mellitus, leukemia, and Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. In the case described, treatment necessitated a multidisciplinary approach with input from medical and dental specialties for a young patient with severe periodontal breakdown associated with CANDLE syndrome.","['McKenna, Gerald J', 'Ziada, Hassan M']","['McKenna GJ', 'Ziada HM']","[""Currently, Center for Public Health, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland; previously, Cork University Dental School and Hospital, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland."", 'Faculty of Dentistry, Kuwait University, Kuwait, Kuwait.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],United States,Clin Adv Periodontics,Clinical advances in periodontics,101597440,,IM,,['NOTNLM'],"['Child', 'periodontal diseases', 'skin diseases', 'syndrome']",2015/08/01 00:00,2015/08/01 00:01,['2020/07/22 06:00'],"['2013/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1902/cap.2013.130071 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Adv Periodontics. 2015 Aug;5(3):153-158. doi: 10.1902/cap.2013.130071.,,,,['(c) 2015 American Academy of Periodontology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Robust analysis of outcomes for CLL patients, particularly examining effects of baseline characteristics and CLL-directed therapy, is critical to optimally manage CLL patients through this evolving pandemic. CLL patients diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 across 43 international centers (n = 198) were included. Hospital admission occurred in 90%. Median age at COVID-19 diagnosis was 70.5 years. Median Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score was 8 (range, 4-32). Thirty-nine percent were treatment naive (""watch and wait""), while 61% had received >/=1 CLL-directed therapy (median, 2; range, 1-8). Ninety patients (45%) were receiving active CLL therapy at COVID-19 diagnosis, most commonly Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi's; n = 68/90 [76%]). At a median follow-up of 16 days, the overall case fatality rate was 33%, though 25% remain admitted. Watch-and-wait and treated cohorts had similar rates of admission (89% vs 90%), intensive care unit admission (35% vs 36%), intubation (33% vs 25%), and mortality (37% vs 32%). CLL-directed treatment with BTKi's at COVID-19 diagnosis did not impact survival (case fatality rate, 34% vs 35%), though the BTKi was held during the COVID-19 course for most patients. These data suggest that the subgroup of CLL patients admitted with COVID-19, regardless of disease phase or treatment status, are at high risk of death. Future epidemiologic studies are needed to assess severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection risk, these data should be validated independently, and randomized studies of BTKi's in COVID-19 are needed to provide definitive evidence of benefit.","['Mato, Anthony R', 'Roeker, Lindsey E', 'Lamanna, Nicole', 'Allan, John N', 'Leslie, Lori', 'Pagel, John M', 'Patel, Krish', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Wojenski, Daniel', 'Kamdar, Manali', 'Huntington, Scott F', 'Davids, Matthew S', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Antic, Darko', 'Jacobs, Ryan', 'Ahn, Inhye E', 'Pu, Jeffrey', 'Isaac, Krista M', 'Barr, Paul M', 'Ujjani, Chaitra S', 'Geyer, Mark B', 'Berman, Ellin', 'Zelenetz, Andrew D', 'Malakhov, Nikita', 'Furman, Richard R', 'Koropsak, Michael', 'Bailey, Neil', 'Hanson, Lotta', 'Perini, Guilherme F', 'Ma, Shuo', 'Ryan, Christine E', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Portell, Craig A', 'Shadman, Mazyar', 'Chong, Elise A', 'Brander, Danielle M', 'Sundaram, Suchitra', 'Seddon, Amanda N', 'Seymour, Erlene', 'Patel, Meera', 'Martinez-Calle, Nicolas', 'Munir, Talha', 'Walewska, Renata', 'Broom, Angus', 'Walter, Harriet', 'El-Sharkawi, Dima', 'Parry, Helen', 'Wilson, Matthew R', 'Patten, Piers E M', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jose-Angel', 'Miras, Fatima', 'Fernandez Escalada, Noemi', 'Ghione, Paola', 'Nabhan, Chadi', 'Lebowitz, Sonia', 'Bhavsar, Erica', 'Lopez-Jimenez, Javier', 'Naya, Daniel', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose Antonio', 'Skanland, Sigrid S', 'Cordoba, Raul', 'Eyre, Toby A']","['Mato AR', 'Roeker LE', 'Lamanna N', 'Allan JN', 'Leslie L', 'Pagel JM', 'Patel K', 'Osterborg A', 'Wojenski D', 'Kamdar M', 'Huntington SF', 'Davids MS', 'Brown JR', 'Antic D', 'Jacobs R', 'Ahn IE', 'Pu J', 'Isaac KM', 'Barr PM', 'Ujjani CS', 'Geyer MB', 'Berman E', 'Zelenetz AD', 'Malakhov N', 'Furman RR', 'Koropsak M', 'Bailey N', 'Hanson L', 'Perini GF', 'Ma S', 'Ryan CE', 'Wiestner A', 'Portell CA', 'Shadman M', 'Chong EA', 'Brander DM', 'Sundaram S', 'Seddon AN', 'Seymour E', 'Patel M', 'Martinez-Calle N', 'Munir T', 'Walewska R', 'Broom A', 'Walter H', 'El-Sharkawi D', 'Parry H', 'Wilson MR', 'Patten PEM', 'Hernandez-Rivas JA', 'Miras F', 'Fernandez Escalada N', 'Ghione P', 'Nabhan C', 'Lebowitz S', 'Bhavsar E', 'Lopez-Jimenez J', 'Naya D', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Skanland SS', 'Cordoba R', 'Eyre TA']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ.', 'Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, WA.', 'Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, WA.', 'Karolinska Institute, Solna, Sweden.', 'Robert H.

Therefore, there is a major need to accelerate the evaluation of innovative medicines, yet drug development continues to be adult-focused. Furthermore, the large number of competing agents in rare patient populations requires coordinated prioritisation, within the global regulatory framework and cooperative group initiatives. METHODS: The fourth multi-stakeholder Paediatric Strategy Forum focused on AML in children and adolescents. RESULTS: CD123 is a high priority target and the paediatric development should be accelerated as a proof-of-concept. Efforts must be coordinated, however, as there are a limited number of studies that can be delivered. Studies of FLT3 inhibitors in agreed paediatric investigation plans present challenges to be completed because they require enrolment of a larger number of patients than actually exist. A consensus was developed by industry and academia of optimised clinical trials. For AML with rare mutations that are more frequent in adolescents than in children, adult trials should enrol adolescents and when scientifically justified, efficacy data could be extrapolated. Methodologies and definitions of minimal residual disease need to be standardised internationally and validated as a new response criterion. Industry supported, academic sponsored platform trials could identify products to be further developed. The Leukaemia and Lymphoma Society PedAL/EUpAL initiative has the potential to be a major advance in the field. CONCLUSION: These initiatives continue to accelerate drug development for children with AML and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.","['Pearson, Andrew D J', 'Zwaan, C Michel', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Karres, Dominik', 'Guillot, Julie', 'Kim, Su Young', 'Marshall, Lynley', 'Tasian, Sarah K', 'Smith, Malcolm', 'Cooper, Todd', 'Adamson, Peter C', 'Barry, Elly', 'Benettaib, Bouchra', 'Binlich, Florence', 'Borgman, Anne', 'Brivio, Erica', 'Capdeville, Renaud', 'Delgado, David', 'Faller, Douglas', 'Fogelstrand, Linda', 'Fraenkel, Paula Goodman', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Heenen, Delphine', 'Kaspers, Gertjan', 'Kieran, Mark', 'Klusmann, Jan-Henning', 'Lesa, Giovanni', 'Ligas, Franca', 'Mappa, Silvia', 'Mohamed, Hesham', 'Moore, Andrew', 'Morris, Joan', 'Nottage, Kerri', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Scobie, Nicole', 'Simko, Stephen', 'Winkler, Thomas', 'Norga, Koen', 'Reaman, Gregory', 'Vassal, Gilles']","['Pearson ADJ', 'Zwaan CM', 'Kolb EA', 'Karres D', 'Guillot J', 'Kim SY', 'Marshall L', 'Tasian SK', 'Smith M', 'Cooper T', 'Adamson PC', 'Barry E', 'Benettaib B', 'Binlich F', 'Borgman A', 'Brivio E', 'Capdeville R', 'Delgado D', 'Faller D', 'Fogelstrand L', 'Fraenkel PG', 'Hasle H', 'Heenen D', 'Kaspers G', 'Kieran M', 'Klusmann JH', 'Lesa G', 'Ligas F', 'Mappa S', 'Mohamed H', 'Moore A', 'Morris J', 'Nottage K', 'Reinhardt D', 'Scobie N', 'Simko S', 'Winkler T', 'Norga K', 'Reaman G', 'Vassal G']","['ACCELERATE/ITCC, Belgium.

Quantification of BCR-ABL1 transcripts using ABL1 or GUSB as control genes on the early molecular response (MR) to frontline nilotinib was studied using data from 60 patients with chronic-phase CML from the Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials as First-Line Treatment (ENEST1st) substudy. Effects of BCR-ABL1/ABL1 and BCR-ABL1/GUSB ratios at early time points as independent variables on subsequent MR were determined by logistic regression analyses and predictive cut-off values determined by receiver operating curve analyses. From day 45, concordance was found for both control genes' early transcript kinetics and ability to predict subsequent deep MR at 18 months. From baseline to 3 months, transcripts descended linearly with both control genes. Use of ABL1 allowed for an earlier prediction (2 months) of subsequent MR than with GUSB (3 months), with cut-off values of 1.5% and 0.19%, respectively. The dynamic determination of BCR-ABL1 transcripts using either internal control gene is valid and predictive of subsequent MR. The use of GUSB to predict an earlier and more accurate response than ABL1 is not supported in the results. Accurate early indicators of MR are essential to identify patients likely to have inferior outcomes who may benefit from treatment with an alternative tyrosine kinase inhibitor.","['Stuckey, Ruth', 'Casado, Luis-Felipe', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Gomez-Casares, Maria Teresa', 'Casas, Laura', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, Valentin', 'Sastre, Jose Luis', 'Ramirez-Payer, Angel', 'Vall-Llovera, Ferran', 'Goni, Maria Angeles', 'Xicoy, Blanca', 'Godoy, Ana Cristina', 'Nunez, Javier', 'Mora, Itxaso', 'Vallansot, Rolando', 'Lopez-Lorenzo, Jose Luis', 'Palomera, Luis', 'Conesa, Venancio', 'Noya, Maria Soledad', 'Sanchez-Guijo, Fermin', 'Pena, Ascension', 'Bautista, Guiomar', 'Steegmann, Juan Luis']","['Stuckey R', 'Casado LF', 'Colomer D', 'Gomez-Casares MT', 'Casas L', 'Garcia-Gutierrez V', 'Sastre JL', 'Ramirez-Payer A', 'Vall-Llovera F', 'Goni MA', 'Xicoy B', 'Godoy AC', 'Nunez J', 'Mora I', 'Vallansot R', 'Lopez-Lorenzo JL', 'Palomera L', 'Conesa V', 'Noya MS', 'Sanchez-Guijo F', 'Pena A', 'Bautista G', 'Steegmann JL']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Gran Canaria Dr. Negrin, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic Universitari, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Gran Canaria Dr. Negrin, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Dynamics Solutions, Madrid, Spain.', 'Ramon y Cajal Health Research Institute, Hospital Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Orense, Orense, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitari Mutua Terrassa, Terrassa, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Navarra, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Universitari Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Aragon Institute of Health Investigation, Hospital Clinico Universitario Lozano Blesa, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital General Universitario de Elche, Elche, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Complexo Hospitalario Universitario A Coruna, A Coruna, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico de San Carlos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Majadahonda, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.

In this preliminary study, we tested the anti-tumor activity of maltotriose-modified fourth-generation poly(propylene imine) glycodendrimers (PPI-G4-M3) in vivo in the subcutaneous MEC-1 xenograft model of human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in NOD scid gamma mice. Fludarabine was used for model validation and as a positive treatment control. The anti-tumor response was calculated as tumor volume, tumor control ratio, and tumor growth inhibition. The study showed that PPI-G4-M3 inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth more efficiently than fludarabine. The anti-tumor response was dose-dependent. Cationic PPI-G4-M3 showed the highest anti-tumor activity but also higher toxicity than the neutral dendrimers and fludarabine. These first promising results warrant further studies in the optimization of dendrimers charge, dose, route and schedule of administration to combat CLL.","['Franiak-Pietryga, Ida', 'Ziemba, Barbara', 'Sikorska, Hanna', 'Jander, Magdalena', 'Kuncman, Wojciech', 'Danilewicz, Marian', 'Appelhans, Dietmar', 'Lewkowicz, Przemyslaw', 'Ostrowska, Kinga', 'Bryszewska, Maria', 'Borowiec, Maciej']","['Franiak-Pietryga I', 'Ziemba B', 'Sikorska H', 'Jander M', 'Kuncman W', 'Danilewicz M', 'Appelhans D', 'Lewkowicz P', 'Ostrowska K', 'Bryszewska M', 'Borowiec M']","['Department of Clinical and Laboratory Genetics, Medical University of Lodz, Pomorska Str. 251, 92-213 Lodz, Poland; GeneaMed LTD, 16/18 Kopcinskiego Str, 90-232 Lodz, Poland; University of California San Diego, Moores Cancer Center, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093, United States of America.

RESULTS: From January 2015 to January 2019, we identified a total of 233 dogs and 100 cats with metastatic disease. Of these, 11.6% (27/233) of the dogs and 13% (13/100) of the cats had ocular metastases. Lymphoma was the most common multicentric neoplasm involving the eyes of both species. In dogs, these neoplasms occurred bilaterally, predominantly in the anterior uvea, and were diffuse large B-cell, T-lymphoblastic, peripheral T-cell not otherwise specified, and lymphocytic B-cell lymphomas. In cats, feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-associated T-cell lymphoma was the most common. Mammary carcinoma was the second most common ocular metastatic neoplasm in bitches, with a predominantly unilateral involvement of the uveal tract. In cats, following lymphoma, pulmonary and squamous cell carcinomas were the most common multicentric/metastatic neoplasms of the eyes. Individual cases of cholangiocarcinoma, hemangiosarcoma, and chemodectoma in dogs, as well as mammary gland cribriform carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, and histiocytic sarcoma in cats were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The eyes of dogs were mostly affected by lymphoma or mammary gland carcinoma, while those of cats mostly had lymphoma, pulmonary carcinoma, or squamous cell carcinoma as the main metastatic/multicentric neoplasm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify intraocular metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and chemodectoma in dogs, aside from identifying salivary gland carcinoma in cats.","['Bandinelli, Marcele Bettim', 'Viezzer Bianchi, Matheus', 'Wronski, Julia Gabriela', 'Santos de Mello, Lauren', 'Blanco DeMartini, Renata', 'Savi, Caroline', 'Sonne, Luciana', 'Driemeier, David', 'Petinatti Pavarini, Saulo']","['Bandinelli MB', 'Viezzer Bianchi M', 'Wronski JG', 'Santos de Mello L', 'Blanco DeMartini R', 'Savi C', 'Sonne L', 'Driemeier D', 'Petinatti Pavarini S']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Vet Ophthalmol,Veterinary ophthalmology,100887377,,IM,"['Animals', 'Autopsy/veterinary', 'Cat Diseases/*pathology', 'Cats', 'Dog Diseases/*pathology', 'Dogs', 'Eye Neoplasms/pathology/secondary/*veterinary', 'Female', 'Lymphoma/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['canine', 'eye', 'feline', 'lymphoma', 'mammary carcinoma', 'metastasis', 'ocular pathology', 'oncology']",2020/07/21 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2019/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/vop.12803 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Ophthalmol. 2020 Sep;23(5):814-827. doi: 10.1111/vop.12803.

In small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells, the response to ABT-263 is associated with the expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) protein, however the efficacy of ABT-263 in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been thoroughly evaluated. There are currently no established biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of ABT-263 treatment in NSCLC. We screened a panel of different NSCLC cell lines and found that ABT-263 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in Calu-1, Calu-3, and BID007 cells. Inconsistent with previous reports on SCLC, low levels of MCL-1 did not predict the response to ABT-263 in NSCLC cells, however we found that intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells were associated with sensitivity to ABT-263 in NSCLC cells. We also showed that increasing the level of intracellular ROS could enhance the sensitivity to ABT-263 in NSCLC cells. In summary, we propose that the intracellular levels of ROS could be used as a potential novel biomarker for predicting a response to ABT-263 in NSCLC. Furthermore, we show some evidence supporting the further assessment of ABT-263 as a new therapeutic strategy in patients with NSCLC combined with agents regulating ROS levels. We believe that our findings and follow-up studies on this matter would lead to novel diagnostic and treatment strategies in patients with NSCLC.","['Ohgino, Keiko', 'Terai, Hideki', 'Yasuda, Hiroyuki', 'Nukaga, Shigenari', 'Hamamoto, Junko', 'Tani, Tetsuo', 'Kuroda, Aoi', 'Arai, Daisuke', 'Ishioka, Kota', 'Masuzawa, Keita', 'Ikemura, Shinnosuke', 'Kawada, Ichiro', 'Naoki, Katsuhiko', 'Fukunaga, Koichi', 'Soejima, Kenzo']","['Ohgino K', 'Terai H', 'Yasuda H', 'Nukaga S', 'Hamamoto J', 'Tani T', 'Kuroda A', 'Arai D', 'Ishioka K', 'Masuzawa K', 'Ikemura S', 'Kawada I', 'Naoki K', 'Fukunaga K', 'Soejima K']","['Department of Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Translational Research, Clinical and Translational Research Center, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kitasato University, Kitasato Institute Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Keio Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara-city, Japan.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Translational Research, Clinical and Translational Research Center, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/etiology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-263', 'BCL-2 inhibitor', 'navitoclax', 'non-small-cell lung cancer', 'reactive oxygen species']",2020/07/21 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2019/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14569 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2020 Oct;111(10):3793-3801. doi: 10.1111/cas.14569.

Increasing evidence indicates that the elevated expression of CD25 may be correlated with poor survival for AML patients. Thus, we performed this meta-analysis to further evaluate the prognostic value of elevated CD25 in AML. Eligible studies were gathered by searching on PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Using the R language 3.6.0 software, Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS)/relapse-free survival (RFS)/event-free survival (EFS) for total and subgroup analyses were calculated to investigate the association of elevated CD25 and outcomes of AML patients. Ten studies with a total of 1640 participants were enrolled in this meta-analysis. Pooled HRs suggested that overexpression of CD25 predicted poor outcomes on both OS (HR = 2.27, 95%CI 1.95-2.64) and DFS/RFS/EFS (HR = 1.77, 95%CI 1.44-2.17) in overall population. Subgroup analyses stratified by ethnicity, AML subtype, cut-off value, statistical methodologies and detection method draw similar results. Our meta-analysis indicates that elevated CD25 expression is a poor prognostic factor for AML patients. Considering limited number of samples, further relevant studies are warranted.","['Li, Jingyuan', 'Ran, Qijie', 'Xu, Biao', 'Luo, Xiaojing', 'Song, Senhua', 'Xu, Dehong', 'Zhang, Xinhua']","['Li J', 'Ran Q', 'Xu B', 'Luo X', 'Song S', 'Xu D', 'Zhang X']","['Department of Hematology, The General Hospital of Central Theater Command, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The General Hospital of Central Theater Command, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The General Hospital of Central Theater Command, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The General Hospital of Central Theater Command, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The General Hospital of Central Theater Command, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The General Hospital of Central Theater Command, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The General Hospital of Central Theater Command, Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)'],IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",,,2020/07/21 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0236124 [doi]', 'PONE-D-20-07095 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Jul 20;15(7):e0236124. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0236124. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5725-0500'],20200720,,,,PMC7371194,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tolerability and efficacy of venetoclax in combination with intensive chemotherapy in AML is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with AML who were >/= 65 years (>/= 60 years if monosomal karyotype) and fit for intensive chemotherapy were allocated to venetoclax dose-escalation cohorts (range, 50-600 mg). Venetoclax was administered orally for 14 days each cycle. During induction, a 7-day prephase/dose ramp-up (days -6 to 0) was followed by an additional 7 days of venetoclax combined with infusional cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 and idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 2-3 (ie, 5 + 2). Consolidation (4 cycles) included 14 days of venetoclax (days -6 to 7) combined with cytarabine (days 1-2) and idarubicin (day 1). Maintenance venetoclax was permitted (7 cycles). The primary objective was to assess the optimal dose schedule of venetoclax with 5 + 2. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with a median age of 72 years (range, 63-80 years) were included. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached with venetoclax 600 mg/day. The main grade >/= 3 nonhematologic toxicities during induction were febrile neutropenia (55%) and sepsis (35%). In contrast to induction, platelet recovery was notably delayed during consolidation cycles. The overall response rate (complete remission [CR]/CR with incomplete count recovery) was 72%; it was 97% in de novo AML and was 43% in secondary AML. During the venetoclax prephase, marrow blast reductions (>/= 50%) were noted in NPM1-, IDH2-, and SRSF2-mutant AML. CONCLUSION: Venetoclax combined with 5 + 2 induction chemotherapy was safe and tolerable in fit older patients with AML. Although the optimal postremission therapy remains to be determined, the high remission rate in de novo AML warrants additional investigation (ANZ Clinical Trial Registry No. ACTRN12616000445471).","['Chua, Chong Chyn', 'Roberts, Andrew W', 'Reynolds, John', 'Fong, Chun Yew', 'Ting, Stephen B', 'Salmon, Jessica M', 'MacRaild, Sarah', 'Ivey, Adam', 'Tiong, Ing Soo', 'Fleming, Shaun', 'Brown, Fiona C', 'Loo, Sun', 'Majewski, Ian J', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Wei, Andrew H']","['Chua CC', 'Roberts AW', 'Reynolds J', 'Fong CY', 'Ting SB', 'Salmon JM', 'MacRaild S', 'Ivey A', 'Tiong IS', 'Fleming S', 'Brown FC', 'Loo S', 'Majewski IJ', 'Bohlander SK', 'Wei AH']","['Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Alfred and Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Monash University, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Austin Hospital, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Box Hill Hospital, Box Hill, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

The role of aberrantly expressed RBPs in human disease is an exciting research field and the potential application of RBPs as a therapeutic target or a diagnostic marker represents a fast-growing area of research.Aberrant overexpression of the human RNA-binding protein La has been found in various cancer entities including lung, cervical, head and neck, and chronic myelogenous leukaemia. Cancer-associated La protein supports tumour-promoting processes such as proliferation, mobility, invasiveness and tumour growth. Moreover, the La protein maintains the survival of cancer cells by supporting an anti-apoptotic state that may cause resistance to chemotherapeutic therapy.The human La protein represents a multifunctional post-translationally modified RNA-binding protein with RNA chaperone activity that promotes processing of non-coding precursor RNAs but also stimulates the translation of selective messenger RNAs encoding tumour-promoting and anti-apoptotic factors. In our model, La facilitates the expression of those factors and helps cancer cells to cope with cellular stress. In contrast to oncogenes, able to initiate tumorigenesis, we postulate that the aberrantly elevated expression of the human La protein contributes to the non-oncogenic addiction of cancer cells. In this review, we summarize the current understanding about the implications of the RNA-binding protein La in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. The concept of exploiting the RBP La as a cancer drug target will be discussed.","['Sommer, Gunhild', 'Heise, Tilman']","['Sommer G', 'Heise T']","['Department for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Department for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,RNA Biol,RNA biology,101235328,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (La protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Transfer/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcl2', '*BiP', '*CCND1', '*IRES', '*LARP', '*La autoantigen', '*La protein', '*La-related proteins', '*La/SSB', '*Laminin B1', '*Mdm2', '*PTM', '*RBP', '*RNA-binding', '*SUMO', '*TOP mRNAs', '*XIAP', '*anti-apoptotic', '*cancer', '*cyclin D1', '*invasion', '*non-oncogenic addiction', '*posttranslational modification', '*proliferation', '*translation', '*tumour-promoting']",2020/07/21 06:00,2021/12/01 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15476286.2020.1792677 [doi]'],ppublish,RNA Biol. 2021 Feb;18(2):218-236. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2020.1792677.

A magnetic graphene nanoribbon-boronic-acid-based immunosensor was developed and tested for the impedimetric detection of lymphoma cancer cells, a blood cancer biomarker. Magnetic graphene nanoribbons (MGNRs) were modified with boronic acid (BA) to create a supporting matrix that is utilized by immobilizing anti-CD20 antibodies with good orientation. The prepared biosensing layer (MGNR/BA/Ab) with well-oriented antibodies was premixed into whole blood samples to interact with lymphoma cancer cell receptors. In the presence of target cell receptors, an immunocomplex was formed between anti-CD20 antibodies and lymphoma cancer cell receptors. Then, the biosensing layer was magnetically collected on a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) and placed in a homemade electrochemical cell configuration to measure impedimetric signals. The fabrication steps of the immunosensor were characterized by various techniques, such as resonance light scattering, fluorescence, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The assay is highly sensitive: the calculated limit of detection of lymphoma cancer cells was as low as 38 cells/mL, and the detection was linear from 100 to 1000000 cells/mL. The specificity of the immunosensor is also very high, and there is no interference effect with several potential interferents, such as the breast cancer (MCF-7), human embryonic kidney (HEK293), and leukemia (HL-60 and KCL-22) cell lines. The performance of the immunosensor for lymphoma cancer cells in clinical blood samples is consistent with that of commercial flow cytometric assays.","['Hashemi, Pegah', 'Afkhami, Abbas', 'Baradaran, Behzad', 'Halabian, Raheleh', 'Madrakian, Tayyebeh', 'Arduini, Fabiana', 'Nguyen, Tien Anh', 'Bagheri, Hasan']","['Hashemi P', 'Afkhami A', 'Baradaran B', 'Halabian R', 'Madrakian T', 'Arduini F', 'Nguyen TA', 'Bagheri H']","['Faculty of Chemistry, Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Applied Microbiology Research Center, Systems Biology and Poisonings Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran.', 'Department of Chemical Science and Technologies, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via della Ricerca Scientifica, 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Physics, Le Quy Don Technical University, Ha Noi, Viet Nam.', 'Chemical Injuries Research Center, Systems Biology and Poisonings Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (Antibodies, Immobilized)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Nanotubes, Carbon)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Immobilized/chemistry/*immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/immunology', 'Boronic Acids/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Electrochemical Techniques', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/*methods', 'Limit of Detection', 'Lymphoma/*blood/pathology', 'Magnetic Phenomena', 'Nanotubes, Carbon/*chemistry', 'Rituximab/chemistry/immunology']",,,2020/07/21 06:00,2021/04/01 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02357 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2020 Aug 18;92(16):11405-11412. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.0c02357.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are characterized by the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 K) pathway via B-cell receptor signaling. The PI3 K delta (PI3 Kdelta) p110delta isoform inhibitor, idelalisib, showed high anti-tumor activity in this group of tumors. It was the first agent from a new class of isoform-specific inhibitors to receive regulatory approvals for the treatment of refractory/relapsed CLL, as well as small lymphocytic lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. AREAS COVERED: In this paper, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the activity and safety profile of idelalisib and other, newly developed PI3 K inhibitors in patients with indolent B-cell malignancies. EXPERT OPINION: Idelalisib is a very potent anti-lymphoma agent in CLL and other NHL. However, there are some limitations of its broad clinical use according to some important side effects observed during treatment. Consequently, the development of new PI3 K inhibitors, which will be highly active and possess better safety profiles are warranted.","['Smolewski, Piotr', 'Rydygier, Dominika']","['Smolewski P', 'Rydygier D']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Medical University of Lodz , Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Medical University of Lodz , Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Purines/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolinones/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Idelalisib', 'chronic lymphocytic lymphoma', 'follicular lymphoma', 'small lymphocytic lymphoma']",2020/07/21 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14656566.2020.1791083 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2020 Oct;21(15):1915-1926. doi: 10.1080/14656566.2020.1791083.

Currently, several gene therapy products are approved and used in the clinic. Lentiviral vectors (LVs) are one of the most used transfer vehicles to deliver genetic material and the vector of choice to modify hematopoietic cells to correct primary immunodeficiencies, hemoglobinopathies, and leukodystrophies. LVs are also widely used to modify T cells to treat cancers in immunotherapies (e.g., chimeric antigen receptors T cell therapies, CAR-T). In genome editing, LVs are used to deliver sequence-specific designer nucleases and DNA templates. The approval LV gene therapy products (e.g., Kymriah, for B-cell Acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment; LentiGlobin, for beta-thalassemia treatment) reinforced the need to improve their bioprocess manufacturing. The production has been mostly dependent on transient transfection. Production from stable cell lines facilitate GMP compliant processes, providing an easier scale-up, reproducibility and cost-effectiveness. The establishment of stable LV producer cell lines presents, however, several difficulties, with the cytotoxicity of some of the vector proteins being a major challenge. Genome editing technologies pose additional challenges to LV producer cells. Herein the major bottlenecks, recent achievements, and perspectives in the development of LV stable cell lines are revised.","['Ferreira, Mariana V', 'Cabral, Elisa T', 'Coroadinha, Ana Sofia']","['Ferreira MV', 'Cabral ET', 'Coroadinha AS']","['iBET, Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica, Apartado 12, 2781-901, Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Av. da Republica, 2780-157, Oeiras, Portugal.', 'iBET, Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica, Apartado 12, 2781-901, Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Av. da Republica, 2780-157, Oeiras, Portugal.', 'iBET, Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica, Apartado 12, 2781-901, Oeiras, Portugal.', 'Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Av. da Republica, 2780-157, Oeiras, Portugal.', 'The Discoveries centre for Regenerative and Precision Medicine, Nova University Lisbon, Oeiras Campus, Av. da Republica, 2780-157, Oeiras, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Biotechnol J,Biotechnology journal,101265833,,IM,"['*Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', '*Lentivirus/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection']",['NOTNLM'],"['gene therapy', 'genome editing', 'lentiviral vectors', 'packaging cells', 'producer cells']",2020/07/21 06:00,2021/03/06 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2020/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/biot.202000017 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol J. 2021 Jan;16(1):e2000017. doi: 10.1002/biot.202000017.

We extend this paradigm to measuring proteome activity landscapes by acquiring and integrating quantitative data for 10,000 proteins and 55,000 phosphorylation sites (p-sites) from 125 CCLs. These data are used to contextualize proteins and p-sites and predict drug sensitivity. For example, we find that Progesterone Receptor (PGR) phosphorylation is associated with sensitivity to drugs modulating estrogen signaling such as Raloxifene. We also demonstrate that Adenylate kinase isoenzyme 1 (AK1) inactivates antimetabolites like Cytarabine. Consequently, high AK1 levels correlate with poor survival of Cytarabine-treated acute myeloid leukemia patients, qualifying AK1 as a patient stratification marker and possibly as a drug target. We provide an interactive web application termed ATLANTiC (http://atlantic.proteomics.wzw.tum.de), which enables the community to explore the thousands of novel functional associations generated by

The majority of lymphocytes were characterized as intermediate to large with round to convoluted nuclei, coarse to clumped chromatin, rare prominent nucleoli, and moderate amounts of lightly basophilic cytoplasm that frequently contained small magenta granules and/or clear vacuoles. The animal had tested negative for several viruses and other etiologic agents found in nonhuman primates 1 week prior to shipment to the research facility. However, further evaluation of the blood smear revealed rare hemoflagellates, and later testing using real-time PCR and ELISA was confirmatory for Trypanosoma cruzi (T cruzi). Trypanosoma cruzi is a zoonotic pathogen responsible for Chagas disease in people and can have negative consequences on study results when positive animals are inadvertently used for preclinical research. This case report describes a marked large granular lymphocytosis in an otherwise healthy macaque as the only indication of infection with T cruzi in an animal believed to be negative for the infection. Additionally, it highlights the diagnostic limitations of screening tests to rule out diseases in animals intended to be used in preclinical studies.","['Henderson, Sally E', 'Pfeiffer, Sara C', 'Novak, Joseph', 'Peace, Tracy A']","['Henderson SE', 'Pfeiffer SC', 'Novak J', 'Peace TA']","['Battelle Memorial Institute, West Jefferson, OH, USA.', 'Battelle Memorial Institute, West Jefferson, OH, USA.', 'Battelle Memorial Institute, West Jefferson, OH, USA.', 'Battelle Memorial Institute, West Jefferson, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,,IM,"['Animals', '*Chagas Disease/diagnosis/veterinary', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', '*Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/veterinary', 'Macaca fascicularis', '*Trypanosoma cruzi']",['NOTNLM'],"['Trypanosoma cruzi', 'granular lymphocytes', 'hemoflagellates', 'nonhuman primate']",2020/07/21 06:00,2021/09/18 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2019/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/vcp.12879 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2020 Sep;49(3):382-388. doi: 10.1111/vcp.12879.

Few reports have addressed the study of the specific cellular microenvironments which can promote the survival, quiescence, and therefore chemoresistance of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells in the central nervous system. Herein, we showed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy that in xenotransplanted mice, leukaemic cells infiltrate the connective tissue stroma of the choroid plexus, the brain structure responsible for the production of cerebrospinal fluid. The ultrastructural study also showed that leukaemia cells are able to migrate through blood vessels located in the choroid plexus stroma. In short-term co-cultures, leukaemic cells established strong interactions with human choroid plexus fibroblasts, mediated by an increased expression of ITGA4 (VLA-4)/ITGAL (LFA-1) and their ligands VCAM1/ICAM1. Upon contact with leukaemia cells, human choroid plexus fibroblasts acquired a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, with an increased expression of alpha-SMA and vimentin as well as pro-inflammatory factors. Human choroid plexus fibroblasts also have the capacity to reduce the proliferative index of leukaemic blasts and promote their survival and chemoresistance to methotrexate and cytarabine. The inhibition of VLA-4/VCAM-1 interactions using anti-VLA-4 antibodies, and the blockade of Notch signalling pathway by using a gamma-secretase inhibitor partially restored chemotherapy sensitivity of leukaemia cells. We propose that the choroid plexus stroma constitutes a sanctuary for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells in the central nervous system. (c) 2020 The Authors.

However, its clinical use is quite limited due to its toxicity. Recently, interest in MTM has been renewed after its identification as a top candidate for the inhibition of the aberrant fusion transcription factor EWS-FLI1, associated with malignant transformation and progression of Ewing sarcoma tumor family. The mechanism of MTM inhibition involves its reversible non-intercalative interaction with GC-rich DNA regions. As a result of this binding, MTM blocks binding of transcription factors (such as Sp1) to their GC-rich promoters and inhibits transcription of several proto-oncogenes and thus suppresses various types of cancer. Knowledge of the biosynthesis of MTM and its gene cluster has enabled genetic modifications of the gene cluster and combinatorial biosynthesis to produce new modified MTM molecules (""mithralogues"") with improved efficacy and lower toxicity, which has also renewed interest in the clinical development of MTM. However, production yields of MTM and its analogues are low in the natural production strains. Recent developments in genetic engineering approaches have made it possible to increase MTM production through more rational strategies based on genetic manipulations and heterologous expression in optimized chassis. Recent construction of various genetically modified strains of Streptomyces lividans has shown their use for efficient heterologous production of various biologically active secondary metabolites including MTM. KEY POINTS: * Discovery a novel bifunctional glycosyl hydrolase from uncultured microorganism. * Heterologous production of MTM in engineered S. lividans strains is efficient.","['Kormanec, Jan', 'Novakova, Renata', 'Csolleiova, Dominika', 'Feckova, Lubomira', 'Rezuchova, Bronislava', 'Sevcikova, Beatrica', 'Homerova, Dagmar']","['Kormanec J', 'Novakova R', 'Csolleiova D', 'Feckova L', 'Rezuchova B', 'Sevcikova B', 'Homerova D']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 21, 845 51, Bratislava, Slovak Republic. jan.kormanec@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 21, 845 51, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 21, 845 51, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 21, 845 51, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 21, 845 51, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 21, 845 51, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 21, 845 51, Bratislava, Slovak Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,8406612,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Polyketides)', 'NIJ123W41V (Plicamycin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Humans', 'Plicamycin', '*Polyketides', '*Sarcoma, Ewing/drug therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['Aureolic acids', 'Heterologous expression', 'Mithralogues', 'Mithramycin', 'Polyketides', 'Streptomyces']",2020/07/21 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2020/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00253-020-10782-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00253-020-10782-x [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2020 Sep;104(18):7701-7721. doi: 10.1007/s00253-020-10782-x.

We examined the cumulative incidence and clinical presentation of PE in a well-defined cohort of patients with ALL aged 1-45 years treated according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) ALL2008 protocol. Methods: As part of the mandatory toxicity reporting of NOPHO ALL2008, thromboembolism including PE was reported consecutively. The cumulative incidence of first-time PE was calculated using the Aalen-Johansen estimator during a 2.5-year period from ALL diagnosis. We used Fisher's exact test to examine categorical variables and Cox logistic regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for PE. Results: PE was diagnosed in 32 of 1685 patients. The 2.5-year cumulative incidence of first-time PE increased with age: 0.43% (95% CI, 0.18-1.03) in children aged 1-9 years, 3.28% (95% CI, 1.72-6.22) in children aged 10-17 years, and 7.22% (95% CI, 4.61-11.21) in adults aged 18-45 years. The majority of PEs, 78% (25/32), occurred during asparaginase treatment. HRs adjusted for age and sex were associated with male sex (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.0-5.6) and older age (10-17 years: HR 7.5; 95% CI, 2.5-22.2), 18-45 years: HR, 16.5; 95% CI, 6.1-44.5). In two-thirds of the patients (63%; 17/27), PE and its treatment had no impact on the administered doses of asparaginase. PE-associated 30-day mortality was 9.4% (95% CI, 1.9-25.0). Conclusions: Awareness of PE is warranted during ALL treatment. Larger multicenter studies are needed to examine predictors of PE in ALL.","['Tuckuviene, Ruta', 'Bjerg, Cecilie Lundgaard', 'Jonsson, Olafur Gisli', 'Langstrom, Satu', 'Rank, Cecilie Utke', 'Ranta, Susanna', 'Saks, Kadri', 'Trakymiene, Sonata Saulyte', 'Ruud, Ellen']","['Tuckuviene R', 'Bjerg CL', 'Jonsson OG', 'Langstrom S', 'Rank CU', 'Ranta S', 'Saks K', 'Trakymiene SS', 'Ruud E']","['Department of Pediatrics Aalborg University Hospital Aalborg Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics Aalborg University Hospital Aalborg Denmark.', ""Children's Hospital Landspitali, University Hospital Reykjavik Iceland."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation New Children's Hospital and Helsinki University Central Hospital University of Helsinki Helsinki Finland."", 'Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory and Department of Hematology Rigshospitalet University of Copenhagen Copenhagen Denmark.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health Karolinska University Hospital, and Childhood Cancer Research Unit Women's and Children's Health Karolinska Institutet Stockholm Sweden."", ""Department of Oncohematology Tallinn Children's Hospital Tallinn Estonia."", ""Clinic of Children's diseases Faculty of Medicine Vilnius University Vilnius Lithuania."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine Oslo University Hospital Oslo Norway.', 'Institute for Clinical Medicine University of Oslo Oslo Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Res Pract Thromb Haemost,Research and practice in thrombosis and haemostasis,101703775,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'asparaginase', 'incidence', 'pulmonary embolism', 'toxicity']",2020/07/21 06:00,2020/07/21 06:01,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2020/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/rth2.12356 [doi]', 'RTH212356 [pii]']",epublish,Res Pract Thromb Haemost. 2020 Jun 21;4(5):866-871. doi: 10.1002/rth2.12356. eCollection 2020 Jul.,,20200621,,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Objective: We validate an economic model for PV that uses Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) burden as a surrogate endpoint to predict DP (thrombosis, myelofibrosis, and acute leukemia) and overall survival (OS) based on progression-specific mortality. Methods: Long-term observational studies that include information about baseline JAK2 burden were identified via PubMed searches and used to validate the model. Kaplan-Meier (KM) OS curves were extracted using a digitizing software. External validity of the model was analyzed by visually comparing OS curves of the model with the KM curves of the included studies, as well as calculating differences in mean OS estimated as area under the curve (AUC). Results: The model's predictions of cumulative DP were somewhat lower than the published studies. Over 20 years' time, our base case model predicted a mean OS for a PV patient (15.0-16.5 years), which was in line with the published studies (15.8-17.5 years). Modeled mean OS was almost two years longer (1.6-1.9 years) for patients with JAK2 <50% than patients with JAK2 >/=50%. Only three long-term observational studies that satisfied the predefined criteria were found and could be used in the validation, but these studies did not capture JAK2 evolution over time. Improved model predictions of DP and mortality based on the longitudinal evolution of JAK2 could be derived from real-world data sources. Such data are currently scarce and future observational studies should be designed to capture the long-term impact of JAK2 on DP and mortality in PV. Conclusions: Our model, based on JAK2 burden as a marker for DP, generated OS estimations that are in line with results of published data.","['Hjelmgren, Jonas', 'Nilsson, Kristoffer', 'Birgegard, Gunnar']","['Hjelmgren J', 'Nilsson K', 'Birgegard G']","['The Swedish Institute for Health Economics (IHE), Lund, Sweden.', 'The Swedish Institute for Health Economics (IHE), Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Health Econ Outcomes Res,Journal of health economics and outcomes research,101648581,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK2 V617F', 'disease progression', 'economic modeling', 'overall survival', 'polycythemia vera', 'validation']",2020/07/21 06:00,2020/07/21 06:01,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2020/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.36469/jheor.2020.13083 [doi]', 'jheor-7-1-13083 [pii]']",epublish,J Health Econ Outcomes Res. 2020 Jun 4;7(1):61-70. doi: 10.36469/jheor.2020.13083. eCollection 2020.,,20200604,,,,PMC7343343,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, understanding of the mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report participation of exosomal miR-125a/b in GLP-2 mediated intestinal epithelial cells-myofibroblasts cross-talk in intestinal microenvironment. Methods: The effects of GLP-2 on the proliferation and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells in SBS rat models were evaluated. Exosomes were extracted from residual jejunum tissue of GLP-2 or vehicle treated SBS rats using ultracentrifugation method, and identified by nanoparticle trafficking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy and western blotting. miRNA sequencing combined with qRT-PCR validation were used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs. miRNAs, which might be involved in proliferation and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, were screened and further verified by miRNA functional experiments. Moreover, the proliferation-promoting and anti-apoptosis effects of GLP-2 on intestinal myofibroblasts, which expressing GLP-2 receptor, and whether GLP-2 could influence the content of miRNAs in the derived exosomes were studied. The downstream pathways were explored by miRNA function recovery experiment, luciferase reporter assay, pull down experiment, knockdown and overexpression of target gene and other experiments based on the bioinformatics prediction of miRNA target gene. Results: GLP-2 significantly promoted intestinal growth, facilitated the proliferation of intestinal crypt epithelial cells and inhibited the apoptosis of intestinal villi epithelial cells in type II SBS rats. GLP-2 significantly down-regulated exosomal miR-125a/b both in residual jejunums derived exosomes and in exosomes secreted by GLP-2R positive cells. Exosomal miR-125a/b was responsible for GLP-2 mediated intestinal epithelial cells proliferation promotion and apoptosis attenuation. miR-125a/b inhibited the proliferation and promotes apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells by suppressing the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1). Conclusions: miR-125a/b shuttled by intestinal myofibroblasts derived exosomes regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. GLP-2 treatment significantly decreases the level of miR-125a/b in the exosomes of intestinal myofibroblasts. miR-125a/b modulates the proliferation and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells by targeting the 3'UTR region of MCL1. Hence, this study indicates a novel mechanism of genetic exchange between cells in intestinal microenvironment.","['Cheng, Wei', 'Wang, Kai', 'Zhao, Zhenguo', 'Mao, Qi', 'Wang, Gang', 'Li, Qiurong', 'Fu, Zheng', 'Jiang, Zhiwei', 'Wang, Jian', 'Li, Jieshou']","['Cheng W', 'Wang K', 'Zhao Z', 'Mao Q', 'Wang G', 'Li Q', 'Fu Z', 'Jiang Z', 'Wang J', 'Li J']","['Research Institute of General Surgery, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210000, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, NJU Advanced Institute for Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210000, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210000, China.', ""Department of General Surgery, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, 221000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of General Surgery, Jiangyin Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University, Jiangyin, Jiangsu, 214400, People's Republic of China."", 'Research Institute of General Surgery, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210000, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210000, China.', 'Research Institute of General Surgery, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210000, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Jiangsu Engineering Research Center for MicroRNA Biology and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, NJU Advanced Institute for Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210000, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Jiangsu Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210000, China.', 'Research Institute of General Surgery, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210000, China.', 'Research Institute of General Surgery, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210000, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,"['0 (Glucagon-Like Peptide 2)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, rat)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, rat)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Communication/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Exosomes/metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glucagon-Like Peptide 2/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/cytology/drug effects/*pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Myofibroblasts/drug effects/metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Rats', 'Short Bowel Syndrome/*drug therapy/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Exosomes', '*Glucagon-like peptide-2', '*Proliferation and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells', '*Short bowel syndrome', '*miR-125a/b']",2020/07/21 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2019/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.41802 [doi]', 'thnov10p7561 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2020 Jun 12;10(17):7561-7580. doi: 10.7150/thno.41802. eCollection 2020.,,20200612,,['(c) The author(s).'],,PMC7359098,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The etiology of OPLL is genetically linked, as shown by its high prevalence in Asian populations. However, the molecular mechanism of the disease remains obscure. In this study, we explored the function and mechanism of OPLL-specific microRNAs. Methods: The expression levels of the ossification-related OPLL-specific miR-181 family were measured in normal or OPLL ligament tissues. The effect of miR-181a on the ossification of normal or pathogenic ligament cells was tested using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot, alizarin red staining and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining. The candidate targets of miR-181 were screened using a dual luciferase reporter assay and functional analysis. The link between miR-181a and its target PBX1 was investigated using chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by real-time PCR detection. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis as well as micro-CT scanning were used to evaluate the effects of miR-181 and its antagonist using both tip-toe-walking OPLL mice and in vivo bone formation assays. Results: Using bioinformatic analysis, we found that miR-181a-5p is predicted to play important roles in the development of OPLL. Overexpression of miR-181a-5p significantly increased the expression of ossification-related genes, staining level of alizarin red and ALP activity, while the inhibition of miR-181a-5p by treatment with an antagomir had the opposite effects. Functional analysis identified PBX1 as a direct target of miR-181a-5p, and we determined that PBX1 was responsible for miR-181a-5p's osteogenic phenotype. By chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found that miR-181a-5p controls ligament cell ossification by regulating PBX1-mediated modulation of histone methylation and acetylation levels in the promoter region of osteogenesis-related genes. Additionally, using an in vivo model, we confirmed that miR-181a-5p can substantially increase the bone formation ability of posterior ligament cells and cause increased osteophyte formation in the cervical spine of tip-toe-walking mice. Conclusions: Our data unveiled the mechanism by which the miR-181a-5p/PBX1 axis functions in the development of OPLL, and it revealed the therapeutic effects of the miR-181a-5p antagomir in preventing OPLL development both in vivo and in vitro. Our work is the first to demonstrate that microRNA perturbation could modulate the development of OPLL through epigenetic regulation.","['Liu, Ning', 'Zhang, Zicheng', 'Li, Li', 'Shen, Xiaolong', 'Sun, Baifeng', 'Wang, Ruizhe', 'Zhong, Huajian', 'Shi, Qianghui', 'Wei, Leixin', 'Zhang, Yizhi', 'Wang, Yue', 'Xu, Chen', 'Liu, Yang', 'Yuan, Wen']","['Liu N', 'Zhang Z', 'Li L', 'Shen X', 'Sun B', 'Wang R', 'Zhong H', 'Shi Q', 'Wei L', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang Y', 'Xu C', 'Liu Y', 'Yuan W']","['Department of Orthopedics, Changzheng Hospital Affiliated to Second Military Medical University, 415th Feng Yang Road, Shanghai, 200003, PR China.', 'Undergraduate Brigade, Changhai Hospital Affiliated to Second Military Medical University, 168th Chang Hai Road, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'Research Center of Developmental Biology, Second Military Medical University, 800th Xiang Yin Road, Shanghai, 200433, PR China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Changzheng Hospital Affiliated to Second Military Medical University, 415th Feng Yang Road, Shanghai, 200003, PR China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Changzheng Hospital Affiliated to Second Military Medical University, 415th Feng Yang Road, Shanghai, 200003, PR China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Changzheng Hospital Affiliated to Second Military Medical University, 415th Feng Yang Road, Shanghai, 200003, PR China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Changzheng Hospital Affiliated to Second Military Medical University, 415th Feng Yang Road, Shanghai, 200003, PR China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Changzheng Hospital Affiliated to Second Military Medical University, 415th Feng Yang Road, Shanghai, 200003, PR China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Changzheng Hospital Affiliated to Second Military Medical University, 415th Feng Yang Road, Shanghai, 200003, PR China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Changzheng Hospital Affiliated to Second Military Medical University, 415th Feng Yang Road, Shanghai, 200003, PR China.', 'Research Center of Developmental Biology, Second Military Medical University, 800th Xiang Yin Road, Shanghai, 200433, PR China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Changzheng Hospital Affiliated to Second Military Medical University, 415th Feng Yang Road, Shanghai, 200003, PR China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Changzheng Hospital Affiliated to Second Military Medical University, 415th Feng Yang Road, Shanghai, 200003, PR China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Changzheng Hospital Affiliated to Second Military Medical University, 415th Feng Yang Road, Shanghai, 200003, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,"['0 (Antagomirs)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MIrn181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (mirn181 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antagomirs/administration & dosage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Ligaments/cytology/diagnostic imaging/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Ossification of Posterior Longitudinal Ligament/*genetics/pathology/surgery', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/*genetics', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'X-Ray Microtomography']",['NOTNLM'],"['*OPLL', '*PBX1', '*histone modification', '*miR-181', '*ossification']",2020/07/21 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2020/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.44309 [doi]', 'thnov10p7492 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2020 Jun 12;10(17):7492-7509. doi: 10.7150/thno.44309. eCollection 2020.,,20200612,,['(c) The author(s).'],,PMC7359103,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the use of antifungal therapy, the lesion persisted and fever subsided after surgical drainage of the periorbital abscess. Antifungal treatment continued during chemotherapy. He has been in remission for four years. Mucormycosis should be in the differential diagnosis in infections in children with cancer, especially leukemia, according to clinical and radiologic findings. A high degree of suspicion and prompt systemic empirical antifungal therapy, as well as surgical debridement, are crucial for the survival of patients.

Prospective phase III trial data in the era of novel agents for patients up to 70 years of age are not available. The GMMG-MM5 trial included 601 patients between 18 and 70 years of age, divided in three groups for the present analysis: </=60 years (S1, n = 353), 61-65 years (S2, n = 107) and 66-70 years (S3, n = 141). Treatment consisted of a bortezomib-containing IT, MEL200/ASCT, consolidation, and maintenance with lenalidomide. Adherence to treatment was similar among patients of the three age groups. Overall toxicity during all treatment phases was increased in S2 and S3 compared to S1 (any adverse event/any serious adverse event: S1:81.7/41.8% vs. S2:90.7/56.5% vs. S3:87.2/68.1%, p = 0.05/<0.001). With respect to progression-free survival (log-rank p = 0.73), overall survival (log-rank p = 0.54) as well as time-to-progression (Gray's p = 0.83) and non-relapse mortality (Gray's p = 0.25), no differences were found between the three age groups. Our results imply that an intensive upfront therapy with a bortezomib-containing IT, MEL200/ASCT, lenalidomide consolidation, and maintenance should be applied to transplant-eligible MM patients up to 70 years of age.","['Mai, Elias K', 'Miah, Kaya', 'Bertsch, Uta', 'Durig, Jan', 'Scheid, Christof', 'Weisel, Katja C', 'Kunz, Christina', 'Munder, Markus', 'Lindemann, Hans-Walter', 'Merz,

This is primarily caused by resisting leukemic stem cells (LSCs), which prevent achievement of treatment-free remission in all patients. Here we describe the ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif)-containing Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcgammaRIIb, CD32b) for being critical in LSC resistance and show that targeting FcgammaRIIb downstream signaling, by using a Food and Drug Administration-approved BTK inhibitor, provides a successful therapeutic approach. First, we identified FcgammaRIIb upregulation in primary CML stem cells. FcgammaRIIb depletion caused reduced serial re-plaiting efficiency and cell proliferation in malignant cells. FcgammaRIIb targeting in both a transgenic and retroviral CML mouse model provided in vivo evidence for successful LSC reduction. Subsequently, we identified BTK as a main downstream mediator and targeting the Bcr-Abl-FcgammaRIIb-BTK axis in primary CML CD34(+) cells using ibrutinib, in combination with standard TKI therapy, significantly increased apoptosis in quiescent CML stem cells thereby contributing to the eradication of LSCs.. As a potential curative therapeutic approach, we therefore suggest combining Bcr-Abl TKI therapy along with BTK inhibition.","['Parting, Oliver', 'Langer, Samantha', 'Kuepper, Maja Kim', 'Wessling, Caroline', 'Li, Shaoguang', 'Braunschweig, Till', 'Chatain, Nicolas', 'Maie, Tiago', 'Costa, Ivan G', 'Crysandt, Martina', 'Huber, Michael', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Schemionek, Mirle']","['Parting O', 'Langer S', 'Kuepper MK', 'Wessling C', 'Li S', 'Braunschweig T', 'Chatain N', 'Maie T', 'Costa IG', 'Crysandt M', 'Huber M', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Koschmieder S', 'Schemionek M']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Clemens Hospital, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Computational Genomics, Joint Research Center for Computational Biomedicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Computational Genomics, Joint Research Center for Computational Biomedicine, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Immunology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany. mschemionek@ukaachen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FCGR2B protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, IgG/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,,2020/07/21 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2020/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0977-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0977-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Oct;34(10):2635-2647. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0977-8.

While this can mostly be attributed to disease-related immune dysfunction, it is not known if CLL patients are also constitutionally susceptible to infections. We linked nation-wide Danish registers to explore this possibility, approximating infection susceptibility by use of antimicrobials. We assessed the incidence of antimicrobials among CLL patients and matched controls from the general population for up to 22 years before index diagnosis, and among children and grandchildren of CLL patients and their matched controls. Our analyses showed that for CLL patients overall antimicrobial use began to increase gradually six years before leukemia diagnosis. Before this time point, CLL patients had used significantly more macrolides (relative risk = 1.15; 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.20), antimycotics (1.18; 1.08-1.30), and antivirals (1.62; 1.45-1.81) than controls for up to 22 years before diagnosis. The same pattern of increased use was found among CLL patients' children and grandchildren. Our study suggests that CLL diagnosis is preceded by decades of increased susceptibility to infections.

This has occurred despite increased awareness of the disease and its deleterious effects and despite implementation of management practices aimed at reducing disease transmission. Our objectives were to identify risk factors associated with the within-herd prevalence of BLV-infected cows by using a risk assessment and management program workbook, as well as to determine the current level of BLV prevalence in the Atlantic Canada region. We hypothesized that previously established risk factors, including management practices associated with calf rearing and fly control, would affect within-herd BLV prevalence. Bulk tank milk (BTM) samples were collected in January and April of 2016 and again during the same months in 2017 and 2018 from all dairy farms shipping milk in the region. Samples were tested with ELISA for levels of anti-BLV antibodies to estimate within-herd prevalence. Regional BLV prevalence at the herd level was 88.39% of dairy herds infected in 2016 and 89.30% in 2018. All dairy farms shipping milk and who had BTM samples collected in 2017 (n = 605) were eligible to participate in the risk assessment and management program questionnaire (RAMP), which was developed and distributed to all bovine veterinarians in Atlantic Canada. One hundred and six RAMP were returned, with representation from all 4 provinces. The RAMP results were combined with the mean BTM ELISA results, and univariable logistic regression followed by multivariable logistic regression was performed to investigate the association between RAMP risk factors and the estimated within-herd BLV prevalence. Factors in the multivariable model significantly associated with the odds of a herd being classified as >25% estimated within-herd prevalence included history of diagnosis of clinical BLV and calves receiving colostrum from cows with unknown BLV status. Differences in within-herd prevalence were not associated with hypodermic needle and injection practices, rectal sleeve practices, or using bulls for natural breeding, based on these 106 dairy farms.","['John, E E', 'Keefe, G', 'Cameron, M', 'Stryhn, H', 'McClure, J T']","['John EE', 'Keefe G', 'Cameron M', 'Stryhn H', 'McClure JT']","['Department of Health Management, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown, PE, Canada C1A 4P3.

METHODS: This prospective study included owned cats, diagnosed (cytologically) with multicentric or mediastinal lymphoma and treated with the LOPH (lomustine, vincristine [Oncovin; Antibioticos do Brasil], prednisolone and hydroxydaunorubicin [doxorubicin]) protocol. A complete blood count was performed before every chemotherapy session and any significant abnormalities recorded as possible related toxicities. Median survival time (MST) and disease-free interval were estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: Twenty-one cats were included in this study. Nineteen (90.5%) tested positive for FeLV and were therefore considered to have persistent viremia. Complete response was reported in 81% (n = 17/21), while three had partial remission and one had no response. Seven cats finished the induction protocol within 20-31 weeks (23.1 +/- 4.5; median 20) and all seven received a maintenance protocol. The MST (lymphoma-related survival) for the 21 cats was 214 days. The MST was 214 days for cats with mediastinal lymphoma (n = 13), but it was not reached for multicentric lymphoma (n = 8; P = 0.9). The MST of cats with persistent FeLV antigenemia was 171 days. Grade I anorexia and vomiting occurred in 19% of the cats (n = 4/21). Hematologic toxicity was found in 100% of the cats at some point during their treatment, but it was mostly grade I or II. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia occurred in 16/21, 21/21 and 15/21 cats, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The LOPH protocol was well tolerated by cats with lymphoma and persistent FeLV viremia, and resulted in a better MST than similar studies with other protocols. Novel studies and controlled trials are necessary in order to evaluate the efficacy of different protocols according to the lymphoma subtype, anatomic form and FeLV status.","['Horta, Rodrigo S', 'Souza, Larissa M', 'Sena, Bruna V', 'Almeida, Isabella O', 'Jaretta, Tamara A', 'Pimenta, Marcela M', 'Reche Junior, Archivaldo']","['Horta RS', 'Souza LM', 'Sena BV', 'Almeida IO', 'Jaretta TA', 'Pimenta MM', 'Reche Junior A']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, Veterinary School, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, Vila Velha University, Vila Velha, ES, Brazil.', 'Prof. Ricardo Alexandre Hippler Veterinary Hospital, Vila Velha University, Vila Velha, ES, Brazil.', 'Prof. Ricardo Alexandre Hippler Veterinary Hospital, Vila Velha University, Vila Velha, ES, Brazil.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, Vila Velha University, Vila Velha, ES, Brazil.', 'Treevet, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.', 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Zootechny, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Cat Diseases/drug therapy', 'Cats', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', '*Leukemia, Feline/drug therapy/epidemiology', '*Lymphoma/drug therapy/veterinary', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vincristine']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*doxorubicin', '*intraperitoneal', '*lomustine', '*lymphoid neoplasia', '*prednisolone', '*vincristine']",2020/07/21 06:00,2021/11/25 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1098612X20926893 [doi]'],ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2021 Feb;23(2):86-97. doi: 10.1177/1098612X20926893.

Recent research has shown this tumor variant to be more related to spindle cell lipoma, rather than the originally hypothesized atypical lipomatous tumor spectrum. Here we present a case of a 58-year-old man with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with an enlarging mass on the posterior left shoulder, initially hypothesized to be a benign lipoma. However, magnetic resonance imaging showed a large, multiseptated, heterogeneous mass concerning for soft tissue sarcoma. After resection, pathologic analysis showed cells closely resembling spindle cell lipoma, with additional cellular and fascicular zones containing lipoblasts and mitotic figures. Molecular analysis showed no MDM2 amplification. This lack of amplification indicates this tumor is distinctly different from an atypical lipomatous tumor, which characteristically displays MDM2 amplification. However, tumor expression of RB1 was normal. The majority of atypical spindle cell lipomatous neoplasms are associated with RB1 deletions. We conclude that we have a unique example of an atypical spindle cell lipomatous tumor.","['Wehrle, Chase J', 'Daigle, J Will', 'Ullah, Asad', 'Sharma, Suash', 'Ritter, Edmond F', 'Kruse, Edward J']","['Wehrle CJ', 'Daigle JW', 'Ullah A', 'Sharma S', 'Ritter EF', 'Kruse EJ']","['1421 Department of General Surgery, Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, GA, USA.', '1421 Department of General Surgery, Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, GA, USA.', '1421 Department of Pathology, Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, GA, USA.', '1421 Department of Pathology, Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, GA, USA.', '1421 Department of Plastic Surgery, Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, GA, USA.', '1421 Department of Surgical Oncology, Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, GA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am Surg,The American surgeon,0370522,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Dermatologic Surgical Procedures/*methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/diagnosis', 'Liposarcoma/diagnosis/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*surgery']",['NOTNLM'],"['atypical spindle cell lipomatous neoplasm', 'lipoma', 'well-differentiated spindle cell liposarcoma']",2020/07/21 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/07/21 06:00'],"['2020/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0003134820933601 [doi]'],ppublish,Am Surg. 2020 Sep;86(9):1208-1211. doi: 10.1177/0003134820933601.

Using the French National Health Data System, we examined the HM risks in patients diagnosed with an incident breast cancer between 2007 and 2015, who received chemotherapy for BC. Main outcomes were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), multiple myeloma (MM), Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HL/NHL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphocytic lymphoma (ALL/LL). Among a total of 122 373 BC survivors, 38.9% received chemotherapy only and 61.1% received chemotherapy + G-CSF. Overall, 781 cases of hematologic malignancies occurred. We observed a nonsignificant increase in the risk of AML (aHR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7), of MDS (aHR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9-1.8) and of ALL/LL (aHR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.0-4.4) among patients treated by chemotherapy + G-CSF compared to chemotherapy only.

In all, 13457 survivors of childhood cancer included in the population-based British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort were linked to Hospital Episode Statistics data for England. Risk of CVD related hospitalisation was quantified by standardised hospitalisation ratios (SHRs), absolute excess risks and cumulative incidence. Overall, 315 (2.3%) survivors had been hospitalised at least once for CVD with a 4-fold risk compared to that expected (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7-4.3). Survivors of a central nervous system (CNS) tumour and leukaemia treated with cranial irradiation were at greatest risk of CVD (SHR = 15.6, 95% CI: 14.0-17.4; SHR = 5.4; 95% CI: 4.5-6.5, respectively). Beyond age 60, on average, 3.1% of CNS tumour survivors treated with cranial irradiation were hospitalised annually for CVD (0.4% general population). Cumulative incidence of CVD increased from 16.0% at age 50 to 26.0% at age 65 (general population: 1.4-4.2%). In conclusion, among CNS tumour survivors treated with cranial irradiation, the risk of CVD continues to increase substantially beyond age 50 up to at least age 65. Such survivors should be: counselled regarding this risk; regularly monitored for hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes; advised on life-style risk behaviours. Future research should include the recall for counselling and brain MRI to identify subgroups that could benefit from pharmacological or surgical intervention and establishment of a case-control study to comprehensively determine risk-factors for CVD.","['Reulen, Raoul C', 'Guha, Joyeeta', 'Bright, Chloe J', 'Henson, Katherine E', 'Feltbower, Richard G', 'Hall, Marlous', 'Kelly, Julie S', 'Winter, David L', 'Kwok-Williams, Michelle', 'Skinner, Roderick', 'Cutter, David J', 'Frobisher, Clare', 'Hawkins, Mike M']","['Reulen RC', 'Guha J', 'Bright CJ', 'Henson KE', 'Feltbower RG', 'Hall M', 'Kelly JS', 'Winter DL', 'Kwok-Williams M', 'Skinner R', 'Cutter DJ', 'Frobisher C', 'Hawkins MM']","['Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Public Health England and NHS England & Improvement, Birmingham, UK.', 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, Public Health England, London, UK.', 'National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, Public Health England, London, UK.', 'Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Leeds Cancer Centre, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds, UK.', ""Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Haematology/Oncology, and Children's Haemopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Great North Children's Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK."", 'Newcastle University Centre for Cancer, Clinical and Translational Research Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Clinical Trial Service Unit (CTSU), Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adult', 'Adult Survivors of Child Adverse Events', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer survivorship', '*cohort', '*epidemiology', '*late effects']",2020/07/20 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/07/20 06:00'],"['2020/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.33218 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2021 Feb 1;148(3):572-583. doi: 10.1002/ijc.33218.

However, efficacy seems to be inferior compared to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Impaired T-cell fitness of CLL patients may be involved in treatment failure. Less-differentiated naive-like T cells play an important role in CART expansion and long-term persistence in vivo. These cells are sparse in CLL patients. Therefore, optimization of CART cell production protocols enriching less differentiated T cell subsets may overcome treatment resistance. The B-cell receptor inhibitor ibrutinib targeting Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is approved for the treatment of CLL. Besides BTK, ibrutinib additionally inhibits interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) which is involved in T-cell differentiation. To evaluate the effect of ibrutinib on CART cell production, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from nine healthy donors and eight CLL patients were used to generate CART cells. T-cell expansion and phenotype, expression of homing and exhaustion makers as well as functionality of CART cells were evaluated. CART cell generation in the presence of ibrutinib resulted in increased cell viability and expansion of CLL patient-derived CART cells. Furthermore, ibrutinib enriched CART cells with less-differentiated naive-like phenotype and decreased expression of exhaustion markers including PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3. In addition, ibrutinib increased the cytokine release capacity of CLL patient-derived CART cells. In summary, BTK/ITK inhibition with ibrutinib during CART cell culture can improve yield and function of CLL patient-derived CART cell products.","['Fan, Fuli', 'Yoo, Hyeon Joo', 'Stock, Sophia', 'Wang, Lei', 'Liu, Yibin', 'Schubert, Maria-Luisa', 'Wang, Sanmei', 'Neuber, Brigitte', 'Huckelhoven-Krauss, Angela', 'Gern, Ulrike', 'Schmitt, Anita', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Schmitt, Michael', 'Sellner, Leopold']","['Fan F', 'Yoo HJ', 'Stock S', 'Wang L', 'Liu Y', 'Schubert ML', 'Wang S', 'Neuber B', 'Huckelhoven-Krauss A', 'Gern U', 'Schmitt A', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Dreger P', 'Schmitt M', 'Sellner L']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Oncology Business Unit - Medical Affairs, Takeda Pharma Vertrieb GmbH & Co.

To truly achieve the goal of improving P-AML patients, additional evidence-based research is necessary. We retrospectively reviewed cases of 17 patients diagnosed with P-AML, including seven for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) from January 2012 to June 2019. Among the non-APL, 90% patients (9/10) ended pregnancy prior to induction chemotherapy. The median intervals between diagnosis and start of chemotherapy were 5 days (range 1-14 days). Four patients elected to delay chemotherapy by more than one week. Of the seven APL patients, six received all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) before the diagnostic molecular results. Five patients underwent cesarean sections (CS) and all newborns were alive (four preterm and one full-term deliveries). Overall, approximately 94% of the patients (16/17) are currently alive in remission. To treat P-AML patients in a safer manner, balancing the risk of progressing to advanced disease and proceeding with pregnancy is required. We consider a slight delay (less than 14 days) in the termination of pregnancy may not differ the prognosis to patients with non-APL. For APL, patients will benefit from prompt administration of ATRA for highly suspected cases.","['Li, Yi-Wei', 'Xu, Yang-Feng', 'Hu, Wei', 'Qian, Shen-Xian', 'Chen, Can']","['Li YW', 'Xu YF', 'Hu W', 'Qian SX', 'Chen C']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 216 Huansha Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310006, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Intensive Care Unit, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, HangZhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Intensive Care Unit, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 216 Huansha Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310006, People's Republic of China. sysxqian@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 216 Huansha Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310006, People's Republic of China. allwichen@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cesarean Section', 'Evidence-Based Practice', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chemotherapy', 'Pregnancy']",2020/07/20 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/07/20 06:00'],"['2020/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-02938-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-02938-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 Oct;112(4):487-495. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-02938-2.

Germline BAP1 mutations are found in a spectrum of human malignancies, while ASXL1 mutations recurrently occur in myeloid neoplasm and are associated with poor prognosis. Nearly all ASXL1 mutations are heterozygous frameshift or nonsense mutations in the middle or to a less extent the C-terminal region, resulting in the production of C-terminally truncated mutant ASXL1 proteins. How ASXL1 regulates specific target genes and how the C-terminal truncation of ASXL1 promotes leukemogenesis are unclear. Here, we report that ASXL1 interacts with forkhead transcription factors FOXK1 and FOXK2 to regulate a subset of FOXK1/K2 target genes. We show that the C-terminally truncated mutant ASXL1 proteins are expressed at much higher levels than the wild-type protein in ASXL1 heterozygous leukemia cells, and lose the ability to interact with FOXK1/K2. Specific deletion of the mutant allele eliminates the expression of C-terminally truncated ASXL1 and increases the association of wild-type ASXL1 with BAP1, thereby restoring the expression of BAP1-ASXL1-FOXK1/K2 target genes, particularly those involved in glucose metabolism, oxygen sensing, and JAK-STAT3 signaling pathways. In addition to FOXK1/K2, we also identify other DNA-binding transcription regulators including transcription factors (TFs) which interact with wild-type ASXL1, but not C-terminally truncated mutant. Our results suggest that ASXL1 mutations result in neomorphic alleles that contribute to leukemogenesis at least in part through dominantly inhibiting the wild-type ASXL1 from interacting with BAP1 and thereby impairing the function of ASXL1-BAP1-TF in regulating target genes and leukemia cell growth.","['Xia, Yu-Kun', 'Zeng, Yi-Rong', 'Zhang, Meng-Li', 'Liu, Peng', 'Liu, Fang', 'Zhang, Hao',

Diosgenin is a natural steroidal sapogenin extracted from fenugreek and wild yam and it is one of the major bioactive compounds used in the treatment of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammation. Recent studies have shown a promising effect of diosgenin as an anti-tumor agent for inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in many cancers such as colon cancer, leukemia, breast cancer, and liver cancer. We examined the effects of different concentrations (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 microM) of diosgenin on proliferation of rat C6 and human T98G glioblastoma cell lines. We noticed that diosgenin had a high inhibitory effect on the growth of both C6 and T98G cell lines. Diosgenin induced the differentiation of glioblastoma cells, as determined by the increase in the expression of the differentiation marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); and decreased the dedifferentiation of the cells, as shown by the decrease in the abundance of the dedifferentiation marker proteins Id2, N-Myc, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), and Notch-1. It also induced apoptosis in C6 and T98G cell lines and the molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of apoptosis included increase in pro-apoptotic Bax protein and decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein. Further, the diosgenin-induced suppression of cell migration was correlated with the decrease in expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9; and the inhibition of angiogenesis, as determined by the tube formation assay, was correlated with a decrease in the protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). In conclusion, diosgenin showed anti-tumor effects in glioblastoma cells by induction of differentiation and apoptosis and inhibition of migration, invasion, and angiogenesis.","['Khathayer, Firas', 'Ray, Swapan K']","['Khathayer F', 'Ray SK']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, University of South Carolina School of Medicine, 6439 Garners Ferry Road, Columbia, SC, 29209, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, University of South Carolina School of Medicine, 6439 Garners Ferry Road, Columbia, SC, 29209, USA. swapan.ray@uscmed.sc.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Neurochem Res,Neurochemical research,7613461,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein, rat)', '0 (Bcl2 protein, rat)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (MMP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Mmp2 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (MMP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Mmp9 protein, rat)', 'K49P2K8WLX (Diosgenin)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diosgenin/*pharmacology', 'Glioblastoma/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Rats', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Angiogenesis', 'Apoptosis', 'Differentiation', 'Diosgenin', 'Glioblastoma', 'Invasion']",2020/07/20 06:00,2021/06/02 06:00,['2020/07/20 06:00'],"['2020/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11064-020-03093-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s11064-020-03093-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Neurochem Res. 2020 Oct;45(10):2336-2351. doi: 10.1007/s11064-020-03093-0.

These targeted therapies could be more tolerable than classical antineoplastics, but potential drug-drug interactions (DDI) are relatively frequent. Underestimation or lack of appropriate awareness and management of DDIs with SMIs can jeopardize therapeutic success in AML patients, which often require multiple concomitant medications in the context of prior comorbidities or for the prevention and treatment of infectious and other complications. In this systematic review, we analyze DDIs of glasdegib, venetoclax, midostaurin, quizartinib, gilteritinib, enasidenib, and ivosidenib. CYP3A4 is the main enzyme responsible for SMIs metabolism, and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such azoles, could increase drug exposure and toxicity; therefore dose adjustments (venetoclax, quizartinib, and ivosidenib) or alternative therapies or close monitoring (glasdegib, midostaurin, and gilteritinib) are recommended. Besides, coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with SMIs should be avoided due to potential decrease of efficacy. Regarding tolerability, QTc prolongation is frequently observed for most of approved SMIs, and drugs with a potential to prolong the QTc interval and CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided and replaced by alternative treatments. In this study, we critically assess the DDIs of SMIs, and we summarize best management options for these new drugs and concomitant medications.","['Megias-Vericat, Juan Eduardo', 'Solana-Altabella, Antonio', 'Ballesta-Lopez, Octavio', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Montesinos, Pau']","['Megias-Vericat JE', 'Solana-Altabella A', 'Ballesta-Lopez O', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Montesinos P']","['Servicio de Farmacia, Area del Medicamento, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe.

Zinc is structurally and functionally essential for many transcription factors, therefore it not only has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress functions, but also has insulin-like function, however, its role in the development of obesity-associated cardiac pathogenesis and the potentially underlying mechanism(s) remains unclear. This review aims to summarize the available evidence on the role of zinc homeostasis in the prevention of ORCH. It was recently reported that when four-week old mice were fed either high fat diet (HFD) or normal diet containing deficient, adequate or supplemented zinc, HFD induced obesity and ORCH along with increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and increased expression of B-cell lymphoma/ leukemia 10 (BCL10) and caspase recruitment domain family member 9 (CARD9). These effects were further aggravated by zinc deficiency and significantly alleviated by zinc supplementation. Mechanistically administration of a p38 MAPK specific inhibitor in HFD-fed mice for 3 months did not affect HFD-induced obesity and increased expression of BCL10 and CARD9, but completely abolished HFD/obesity-induced cardiac hypertrophy and inflammation. In cultured cardiomyocytes, inhibition of BCL10 expression by siRNA prevented palmitate-induced increased p38 MAPK activation and atrial natriuretic peptide expression. Deletion of metallothionein abolished the protective effect of zinc on palmitate-induced up-regulation of BCL10 and phospho-p38 MAPK. Taken together with other recent studies, we concluded that HFD and zinc deficiency synergistically induce ORCH by increasing oxidative stress-mediated activation of BCL10/CARD9/p38 MAPK signaling. Zinc supplementation ameliorates ORCH through activation of metallothionein to repress oxidative stress-activated BCL10 expression and p38 MAPK activation.","['Zhang, Haina', 'Cai, Lu']","['Zhang H', 'Cai L']","['Pediatric Research Institute, Departments of Pediatric, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, USA; Center of Cardiovascular Disorders, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Pediatric Research Institute, Departments of Pediatric, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, USA; Departments of Radiation Oncology, Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY, USA.

Decitabine has minimal non-hematologic toxicity and proven efficacy in myeloid diseases, and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has reduced rates of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). We hypothesized that decitabine induction with allo-HSCT and PTCy would improve outcomes in a high-risk myeloid disease population. We performed a phase-II trial of decitabine at 20 mg/m(2) for 10 days followed by allo-HSCT using a myeloablative regimen of fludarabine, IV busulfan and 4 Gy total body irradiation with PTCy for GVHD prophylaxis. Twenty patients underwent decitabine induction and 17 patients proceeded to transplant per protocol. Median overall survival from decitabine induction was 210 days (95 % CI 122-not reached). All patients developed grade 4 neutropenia after decitabine, eleven patients (55 %) developed grade 3-4 infections, and 5 cases were fatal. There were 5/20 (25 %) long-term survivors with a median follow-up of 3.6 years. Decitabine induction followed by myeloablative allo-HSCT in a high-risk population was associated with a high risk of infection and mortality related to enhanced immunosuppression.

LR-AML is defined by favorable cytogenetic/molecular features and/or optimal early response to therapy. However, cumulative anthracycline exposure in contemporary Children's Oncology Group (COG) regimens approach a doxorubicin equivalent exposure of 540 mg/m(2); with rates of non-infection related left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) approaching 15 %. This is a major cause of toxicity in these patients and precludes the further use of anthracyclines in the relapsed setting; therefore, strategies that reduce cardiotoxicity while maintaining excellent outcomes are needed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven pediatric patients with LR-AML were treated with an anthracycline-reduced approach (Aflac-AML regimen) between 2011 and 2016. Patients received four courses of therapy including three high-dose cytarabine containing courses and a cumulative doxorubicin equivalent exposure of 390 mg/m(2), a 28 % reduction in anthracycline dosing compared to current COG regimens. RESULTS: The 3-year DFS and OS was 70.0 % and 85.5 % respectively, from end of Induction I (first chemotherapy cycle) with a median follow-up of 3.2 years. These survival outcomes are comparable to current LR-AML regimens. Only two patients developed non-infection related LVSD during therapy and more importantly, none developed LVSD after completion of therapy. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that LR-AML outcomes can be maintained using a reduced anthracycline chemotherapy regimen, resulting in lower cardiac toxicity. This new chemotherapy backbone is now being tested prospectively (NCT04326439) to further validate its use in pediatric LR-AML.","['Sabnis, Himalee S', 'Minson, Katherine A', 'Monroe, Caitlin', 'Allen, Kristen', 'Metts, Jonathan L', 'Cooper, Todd M', 'Woods, William G', 'Castellino, Sharon M', 'Keller, Frank G']","['Sabnis HS', 'Minson KA', 'Monroe C', 'Allen K', 'Metts JL', 'Cooper TM', 'Woods WG', 'Castellino SM', 'Keller FG']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA; Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA.

It is a therapeutic choice for the blast phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML-BP) in patients failing to respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Lipid core nanoparticles (LDEs) concentrate severalfold more in blast cells than in corresponding normal cells. Incorporation of anticancer drugs to LDE formulations increases the pharmacologic action and decreases the toxicity. We tested a drug-targeting system, LDE-etoposide plus total body irradiation (TBI; 1200 cGy dose), in 13 patients with AML not responding to the induction therapy and in 2 patients with CML-BP refractory to second-generation TKIs. The mean patient age was 46.7 years (range, 22 to 66 years). The LDE-etoposide dose was escalated at 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mg/kg. No patients developed grade 4 or 5 toxicity; however, mucositis grade 3 occurred in 6 patients, 3 patients experienced diarrhea, and 1 patient had an elevated total bilirubin level. No deaths were related to conditioning. All patients were successfully engrafted. The median times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 20 +/- 5 days and 16 +/- 4 days, respectively. Five patients (33.4%) had acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), including 4 grade I, and 1 with grade II, and 8 patients (57.1%) had moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD. This pilot study shows the potential of LDE-etoposide plus TBI as an HCT conditioning regimen in AML patients not responding to the induction and refractory therapies for CML-BP patient. These findings pave the way for subsequent larger clinical trials.","['Rohr, Sandra S', 'Maranhao, Raul C', 'Tavoni, Thauany M', 'Morikawa, Aleksandra T', 'Areco, Kelsy', 'Deus, Debora F', 'Oliveira, Jose S R']","['Rohr SS', 'Maranhao RC', 'Tavoni TM', 'Morikawa AT', 'Areco K', 'Deus DF', 'Oliveira JSR']","['Escola Paulista de Medicina da Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, Brazil; Hospital Santa Marcelina, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Instituto do Coracao (InCor), Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Efficient and specific drug delivery to the BM is an unmet need. We tested delivery of fluorescent indocarbocyanine lipids (ICLs, DiR, DiD, DiI) as a model lipophilic cargo, via different carriers. Systemically injected T-lymphocyte cell line Jurkat delivered ICLs to the BM more efficiently than erythrocytes, and more selectively than PEGylated liposomes. Near infrared imaging showed that the delivery was restricted to the BM, lungs, liver and spleen, with no accumulation in the kidneys, brain, heart, intestines, fat tissue and pancreas. Following systemic injection of ICL-labeled cells in immunodeficient or immunocompetent mice, few cells arrived in the BM intact. However, between 5 and 10% of BM cells were ICL-positive. Confocal microscopy of intact BM confirmed that ICLs are delivered independently of the injected cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the lipid accumulated in both CD11b + and CD11b- cells, and in hematopoietic progenitors. In a xenograft model of acute myeloid leukemia, a single injection of 10 million Jurkat cells delivered DiD to ~15% of the tumor cells. ICL-labeled cells disappeared from blood almost immediately post-intravenous injection, but numerous cell-derived microparticles continued to circulate in blood. The microparticle particle formation was not due to the ICL labeling or complement attack and was observed after injection of both syngeneic and xenogeneic cells. Injection of microparticles produced in vitro from Jurkat cells resulted in a similar ICL delivery as the injection of intact Jurkat cells. Our results demonstrate a novel delivery paradigm wherein systemically injected cells release microparticles that accumulate in the BM. In addition, the results have important implications for studies involving systemically administered cell therapies.","['Yang, Chunyan', 'Chen, Fangfang', 'Ren, Ping', 'Lofchy, Laren', 'Wan, Chun', 'Shen, Jingshi', 'Wang, Guankui', 'Gaikwad, Hanmant', 'Ponder, Jessica', 'Jordan, Craig T', 'Scheinman, Robert', 'Simberg, Dmitri']","['Yang C', 'Chen F', 'Ren P', 'Lofchy L', 'Wan C', 'Shen J', 'Wang G', 'Gaikwad H', 'Ponder J', 'Jordan CT', 'Scheinman R', 'Simberg D']","['China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China; The Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.', 'China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China; The Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, USA.

Both factors are considered as potential tumour biomarkers, while MCL1 has attracted interest as target in cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of NOXA and MCL1 in 160 CRC tumour samples, to investigate their significance, also in combination with IAPs, DR5 expression and KRAS gene mutations in CRC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fresh frozen colorectal tissue was obtained from patients undergoing surgery for CRC. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed for the determination of mRNA expression levels. Protein expression was determined immunohistochemically. Differences in the mRNA expression profile were evaluated with the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Statistical analysis was performed with the use of Mann-Whitney U test and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: NOXA was found to be overexpressed in CRC tumours (P < .0001), even from early stage. Moreover, NOXA/MCL1 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in tumour samples compared to normal pairs (P < .0001). ROC curve analysis showed that both NOXA expression and its combination with Mcl1 expression have fair discriminatory value between CRC and normal colorectal tissue. Combinatorial ROC analysis revealed the most significant discriminatory value of NOXA, MCL1 with cIAP1 and cIAP2 (AUC = 0.834, P < .0001) as a 5-gene panel of markers. CONCLUSION: Noxa, Mcl1, DR5, cIAP1 and cIAP2 mRNA expressions are significantly deregulated in CRC and could provide a panel of markers with significant discriminatory value between CRC and normal colorectal tissue.","['Kosmidou, Vivian', 'Vlassi, Margarita', 'Anagiotos, Kyriakos', 'Raftopoulou, Sofia', 'Kalogerakou, Eirini', 'Skarmalioraki, Salomi', 'Aggeli, Chrysanthi', 'Choreftaki, Theodosia', 'Zografos, George', 'Pintzas, Alexander']","['Kosmidou V', 'Vlassi M', 'Anagiotos K', 'Raftopoulou S', 'Kalogerakou E', 'Skarmalioraki S', 'Aggeli C', 'Choreftaki T', 'Zografos G', 'Pintzas A']","['Laboratory of Signal Mediated Gene Expression, Institute of Chemical Biology, National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Signal Mediated Gene Expression, Institute of Chemical Biology, National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Signal Mediated Gene Expression, Institute of Chemical Biology, National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Signal Mediated Gene Expression, Institute of Chemical Biology, National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Signal Mediated Gene Expression, Institute of Chemical Biology, National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, Greece.', 'Laboratory of Signal Mediated Gene Expression, Institute of Chemical Biology, National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, Greece.', '3rd Department of Surgery, General Hospital of Athens ""G.

METHOD: We evaluated a cohort of 4059 childhood cancer survivors treated between 1975 and 2018. RESULTS: From 4059 survivors, 170 (4.3 %) developed at least one SMN - 193 SMNs in 170 survivors, 21 of them (0.5 % of all survivors) had two or more SMNs and 34 of them (0.8 %) had one SMN and one or more BSNs. Mortality for an SMN was 38.2 % i.e. 1.6 % of all survivors. The most frequent SMNs were thyroid carcinoma (37, 19.2 %), tumors of the central nervous system (25, 13.0 %), soft tissue sarcoma (23, 11.9 %), breast carcinoma (19, 9.8 %), and leukemia (11, 5.7 %). Genetic syndromes were present in 25 patients with SMNs (14.7 %) and in 16 patients with only BSNs (13.4 %). SMNs usually developed in second decade or later after finishing of therapy. We observed some not well known risk factors of SNs e.g. spinal irradiation or(131-)I metaiodobenzylguanidine radiotherapy in 2 cases of secondary thyroid cancer, cyclophosphamide therapy in all 8 cases of secondary urinary bladder sarcoma or 4 from 7 SNMSC developed SMN. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed data from previous studies of SNs and observed some not so well known risk factors. Our results and the literature show that the incidence of SMNs is 3-10 % of survivors and is associated with high mortality.","['Zichova, Andrea', 'Eckschlager, Tomas', 'Ganevova, Marta', 'Malinova, Bela', 'Luks, Ales', 'Kruseova, Jarmila']","['Zichova A', 'Eckschlager T', 'Ganevova M', 'Malinova B', 'Luks A', 'Kruseova J']","['Departement of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2(nd) Medical Faculty, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, V Uvalu 84, 150 06, Prague 5, Czech Republic.', 'Departement of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, 2(nd) Medical Faculty, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, V Uvalu 84, 150 06, Prague 5, Czech Republic.

Chemotherapy toxicity continues to present a major challenge. There is a need to develop novel natural agents to improve survival and quality of life in patients with T-ALL. 20(S)-ginsenoside Rh2 (GRh2) exhibits immune regulation and anti-tumor effects in both cellular and murine xenograft models. In the present study, the anti-cancer mechanisms of 20(S)-GRh2 involved in the immune system and intestinal microbiota were investigated in T-ALL mice. We revealed that 20(S)-Rh2 suppressed T-ALL by blocking the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and enhanced immunity in the spleen by regulating immune factors. In addition, 20(S)-GRh2 altered the composition of the gut microbiota, and promoted intestinal homeostasis by elevating the levels of tight junction proteins, antimicrobial peptides and IgA. 20(S)-GRh2 ameliorated the LPS-induced inflammatory response in the intestine of T-ALL mice. Furthermore, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Akkermansia, Lactobacillus, and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group were positively correlated with anti-tumor immune factors, intestinal barrier-related factors, and the anti-inflammatory response. Conversely, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Parabacteroides and Alistipes had the opposite correlation. Collectively, these results suggest that 20(S)-GRh2 is a safe and effective natural product, that shows promise for the prevention and treatment of T-ALL.","['Xia, Ting', 'Zhang, Bo', 'Li, Yu', 'Fang, Bin', 'Zhu, Xiaoxuan', 'Xu, Bicheng', 'Zhang, Jin', 'Wang, Min', 'Fang, Jianpei']","['Xia T', 'Zhang B', 'Li Y', 'Fang B', 'Zhu X', 'Xu B', 'Zhang J', 'Wang M', 'Fang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, College of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, 300457, PR China.

Previous management risk factor studies were of antibody prevalence rather than the rate of recent infections. Milk samples were collected from cohorts of cows on 112 Michigan dairy herds and tested for BLV using an antibody capture ELISA (n = 3849 cows). Cows were subsequently followed for an average of 21 months. Cows negative for anti-BLV antibodies and still present in their respective herds were retested by the same antibody capture ELISA to estimate within-herd incidence rates. The overall crude incidence rate was 1.46 infections per 100 cow-months at risk for the 1314 retested cows in 107 herds. The average within-herd incidence rate was 2.28 infections per 100 cow-months (range: 0 to 9.76 infections per 100 cow-months). A negative binomial regression model was used to identify herd management practices associated with the within-herd incidence rate. Results of the final multivariable model identified higher herd prevalence, milking frequency, needle reuse, as well as housing post-parturient cows separately, to be associated with increased incidence rate. Utilization of sand bedding for the lactating herd was found to be associated with decreased incidence rates. Results of this study suggest potential routes of BLV transmission which should be further investigated as disease control targets in ongoing control programs.","['Hutchinson, H C', 'Norby, B', 'Erskine, R J', 'Sporer, K R B', 'Bartlett, P C']","['Hutchinson HC', 'Norby B', 'Erskine RJ', 'Sporer KRB', 'Bartlett PC']","['Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Michigan State University, 784 Wilson Rd, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.', 'Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Michigan State University, 784 Wilson Rd, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.

Accordingly, our objectives were to determine the geographic distribution of Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) infection and identify the risk factors associated with cow-level BLV infection in the Egyptian dairy cattle. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1299 mixed breed cows distributed over four provinces in the Nile Delta of Egypt in 2018. The randomly selected cows on each farm were serologically tested for BLV, and the cow's information was obtained from the farm records. Four variables (geographic location, herd size, number of parities, and age) were used for risk analysis. A total of 230 serum samples (17.7 %) were serologically positive for BLV. The highest prevalence of BLV infection was associated with parity (OR = 3.4, 95 %CI 2.4-4.9) with 80 % probability of being BLV-positive at parity >/=5, followed by herd size (OR = 1.8, 95 %CI 1.4-2.2). However, geographic location seems to have no impact on the prevalence of BLV infection in Egypt. Our findings strongly indicate that the intensive surveillance and effective prevention strategies against BLV infection in Egypt should be provided to multiparous cows with >/=5 parities and live in large farm with more than 200 cows.","['Selim, Abdelfattah', 'Megahed, Ameer A', 'Kandeel, Sahar', 'Abdelhady, Abdelhamed']","['Selim A', 'Megahed AA', 'Kandeel S', 'Abdelhady A']","['Department of Animal Medicine (Infectious Diseases), Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Benha University, Moshtohor-Toukh, Kalyobiya, 13736, Egypt.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of factors associated with SCC risk. METHODS: Clinical CLL and SCC data were obtained from Mayo Clinic CLL Resource and self-reported questionnaires among patients with newly diagnosed CLL. We computed the CLL International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI) from CLL prognostic factors, and a polygenic risk score from SCC susceptibility variants. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 1269 patients with CLL, the median follow-up was 7 years, and SCC subsequently developed in 124 patients. Significant associations with SCC risk were history of skin cancer (HR=4.80; 95% CI: 3.37-6.83), CLL-IPI (HR=1.42; 95% CI: 1.13-1.80), and polygenic risk score (HR=2.58; 95% CI: 1.50-4.43). In a multivariable model, these factors were independent predictors (C statistic = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.62-0.76). T-cell immunosuppressive treatments were also associated with SCC risk (HR=2.29; 95% CI: 1.47-3.55; adjusted for age, sex, and prior SCC). LIMITATIONS: The sample size decreases when combining all risk factors in a single model. CONCLUSION: SCC risk includes history of skin cancer, an aggressive disease at time of CLL diagnosis, receiving T-cell immunosuppressive treatments, and high polygenic risk score.

MNDA is also expressed in normal lymphoid cells and in B-cell clones isolated from individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease characterized by abnormal apoptosis control. We found that MNDA expression levels inversely correlate with the amount of the anti-apoptotic proteins MCL-1 and BCL-2 in human CLL samples. We report that in response to chemotherapeutic agents that induce genotoxic stress, MNDA exits its typical nucleolar localization and accumulates in the nucleoplasm of CLL and lymphoid cells. Then, MNDA binds chromatin at Mcl1 and Bcl2 genes and affects the transcriptional competence of RNA polymerase II. Our data also reveal that MNDA specifically associates with Mcl1 and Bcl2 (pre-) mRNAs and favors their rapid turnover as a prompt response to genotoxic stress. We propose that this rapid dynamic tuning of RNA levels, which leads to the destabilization of Mcl1 and Bcl2 transcripts, represents a post-transcriptional mechanism of apoptosis control in CLL cells. These results provide an explanation of previous clinical data and corroborate the finding that higher MNDA expression levels in CLL are associated with a better clinical course.","['Bottardi, Stefania', 'Guieze, Romain', 'Bourgoin, Vincent', 'Fotouhi-Ardakani, Nasser', 'Douge, Aurore', 'Darracq, Anais', 'Lakehal, Yahia A', 'Berger, Marc G', 'Mollica, Luigina', 'Bay, Jacques-Olivier', 'Omichinski, James G', 'Milot, Eric']","['Bottardi S', 'Guieze R', 'Bourgoin V', 'Fotouhi-Ardakani N', 'Douge A', 'Darracq A', 'Lakehal YA', 'Berger MG', 'Mollica L', 'Bay JO', 'Omichinski JG', 'Milot E']","[""Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center, University of Montreal, CIUSSS de l'Est-de-l'Ile de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Unit of Adult Cell Therapy and Clinical Haematology, Clermont-Ferrand, France; Universite Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand Cedex, France.', ""Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center, University of Montreal, CIUSSS de l'Est-de-l'Ile de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."", ""Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center, University of Montreal, CIUSSS de l'Est-de-l'Ile de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Unit of Adult Cell Therapy and Clinical Haematology, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center, University of Montreal, CIUSSS de l'Est-de-l'Ile de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."", ""Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center, University of Montreal, CIUSSS de l'Est-de-l'Ile de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Department of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Unit of Adult Cell Therapy and Clinical Haematology, Clermont-Ferrand, France; Universite Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand Cedex, France.', ""Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center, University of Montreal, CIUSSS de l'Est-de-l'Ile de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Department of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Unit of Adult Cell Therapy and Clinical Haematology, Clermont-Ferrand, France; Universite Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand Cedex, France.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Center, University of Montreal, CIUSSS de l'Est-de-l'Ile de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Department of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.

Activated macrophages play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural polysaccharide, is a specific ligand for CD44 that is overexpressed on the surface of activated macrophages. In this study, HA-coated pH-responsive nanoparticles loaded with MCL-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and dexamethasone (HNPs/MD) were developed for RA treatment. The HNPs/MD had a mean particle size of 117.07 +/- 2.21 nm and zeta potential of 15.53 +/- 1.06 mV. The release rates of both MCL-1 siRNA and dexamethasone from the HNPs/MD at pH 4.5 and 6.0 were higher than those at pH 7.4, indicating that the nanoparticles were acid-sensitive. Cytotoxicity assays showed that compared with single drug loaded nanoparticles, the HNPs/MD showed higher cytotoxicity to activated macrophages. The superior therapeutic effect of HNPs/MD was demonstrated in an adjuvant-induced arthritis rat model. These findings indicate that pH-sensitive and HA-targeting co-delivery nanoparticles provide a new direction for the therapy of RA.","['Li, Xiangyu', 'Yu, Changhui', 'Meng, Xiangxue', 'Hou, Yufei', 'Cui, Yaxin', 'Zhu, Tianyu', 'Li, Yihao', 'Teng, Lesheng', 'Sun, Fengying', 'Li, Youxin']","['Li X', 'Yu C', 'Meng X', 'Hou Y', 'Cui Y', 'Zhu T', 'Li Y', 'Teng L', 'Sun F', 'Li Y']","['School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, China.

While some cases have been associated with a genetic predisposition, nearly all are thought to result from ""late effects"" of therapy-related toxicity that involves chemotherapy or radiation. It is unclear if these tumors are enriched for specific molecular or morphologic characteristics. A query of our institutional nephrectomy registry of 8295 patients for renal neoplasia occurring post-treatment for childhood cancer revealed 6 patients with Wilms tumor, 4 with neuroblastoma, and 1 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Three additional cases of MiT family translocation renal cell carcinoma (RCC), from 2 patients, following chemotherapy for neuroblastoma and systemic lupus erythematosus and another of clear cell RCC post-ALL were included. The most common tumor type was clear cell RCC: 9/19 cases (47.4%), followed by metanephric adenoma and MiT family translocation RCC (3/19, 15.8%). There were no characteristic features to indicate a unique renal neoplasia subtype. Potential syndromic renal neoplasia occurred in 2 patients, metanephric adenomas and oncocytoma in a patient with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome post-treatment of Wilms tumor and a fumarate hydratase-deficient RCC in a patient post-treatment for ALL. The mean age at diagnosis of childhood neoplasia or treatment with chemotherapy or radiation was 4.7 years, and the average time to subsequent renal neoplasia was 31 years. Five (of 14) patients developed metastatic RCC, and there were 2 RCC-related deaths. These results indicate the need for extended clinical follow-up of these patients.","['Gupta, Sounak', 'Vanderbilt, Chad M', 'Leibovich, Bradley C', 'Herrera-Hernandez, Loren', 'Raghunathan, Aditya', 'Sukov, William R', 'Voss, Jesse S', 'Barr Fritcher, Emily G', 'Reed, Katelyn A', 'Lohse, Christine M', 'Reuter, Victor E', 'Jimenez, Rafael E', 'Thompson, R Houston', 'Cheville, John C']","['Gupta S', 'Vanderbilt CM', 'Leibovich BC', 'Herrera-Hernandez L', 'Raghunathan A', 'Sukov WR', 'Voss JS', 'Barr Fritcher EG', 'Reed KA', 'Lohse CM', 'Reuter VE', 'Jimenez RE', 'Thompson RH', 'Cheville JC']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA.

Two different dose schedules were investigated with a starting decitabine dose of either 10 mg/m(2) or 20 mg/m(2) daily for 10 days plus dasatinib 100 mg daily. The target dose level was decitabine 10 mg/m(2) or 20 mg/m(2) daily for 10 days plus dasatinib 140 mg daily. Thirty patients were enrolled, including seven with accelerated-phase CML, 19 with blast-phase CML, and four with Philadelphia-chromosome positive acute myeloid leukemia. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed at the starting dose level with either schedule. Grade >/=3 treatment emergent hematological adverse events were reported in 28 patients. Thirteen patients (48%) achieved a major hematologic response and six (22%) achieved a minor hematologic response, with 44% of these patients achieving a major cytogenetic response and 33% achieving a major molecular response.

Multivariate logistic regression analyses determined that the mean count of lymphocytes was significantly higher in DS infants with TAM (p = .035) and that lymphocytosis confers a risk for TAM (adjusted odds ratio = 7.23, 95% confidence intervals: 2.02-25.92). Pathogenic variants of GATA1 were identified in 2 of 70 analyzed DS neonates (2.9%), of which one had ML-DS and another had an asymptomatic TAM. Among those DS infants with TAM, the GATA1 pathogenic variant detection was 12.5%. Our results indicated that lymphocytosis is associated with TAM in neonates with DS. However, since not all infants with an abnormal CBC had TAM, and not all infants with TAM had GATA1 pathogenic variants, we emphasize that only the search for GATA1 pathogenic variants allows the proper identification of the subgroup of DS infants with a real increasing in risk for ML-DS.","['Orozco-Vela, Mireya', 'Corona-Rivera, Alfredo', 'Cruz-Osorio, Rosa Margarita', 'Mendoza-Maldonado, Lucero', 'Marquez-Mora, Aurea', 'Barba-Barba, Cesar Cenobio', 'Pena-Padilla, Christian', 'Baldomero-Lopez, Alejandra', 'Bobadilla-Morales, Lucina', 'Corona-Rivera, Jorge Roman']","['Orozco-Vela M', 'Corona-Rivera A', 'Cruz-Osorio RM', 'Mendoza-Maldonado L', 'Marquez-Mora A', 'Barba-Barba CC', 'Pena-Padilla C', 'Baldomero-Lopez A', 'Bobadilla-Morales L', 'Corona-Rivera JR']","[""University of Guadalajara, Health Sciences University Center, Department of Molecular Biology and Genomics, 'Dr. Enrique Corona Rivera' Institute of Human Genetics, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico."", ""University of Guadalajara, Health Sciences University Center, Department of Molecular Biology and Genomics, 'Dr. Enrique Corona Rivera' Institute of Human Genetics, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico."", ""'Dr. Juan I.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of LIF on gene expression of VEGF in the choriocarcinoma cells (JEG-3). Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells were treated with different concentrations of LIF (1, 10, and 50 ng) for 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Expression of VEGF was analyzed by real-time PCR. Delta CTs were subjected to one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a post hoc Tukey's test by SPSS version 25.0 software for data analyzing. Results: In the stimulated cells, different concentrations of LIF caused significant decrease of VEGF gene expression (P<0.05) at 12, 24 and 48 hours. In contrast, it was increased after 72 hours (P<0.001). Analysis of data after 6 hours also showed that level of VEGF gene expression was significantly decreased by increasing LIF concentration (P<0.001). Conclusion: Expression level of VEGF gene was decreased in trophoblast cells (except after 72 hours) under the effect of different concentrations of LIF in a time-dependent manner. So, this study showed that further studies are needed to determine the effect of LIF on other angiogenic factors in trophoblast cells.","['Jahanbin, K Hodakaram', 'Ghafourian, Mehri', 'Rashno, Mohammad']","['Jahanbin KH', 'Ghafourian M', 'Rashno M']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.

METHODS: The study sample consisted of APL survivors (n=244), with a median time from diagnosis of 14.3 years (IQR=11.1-16.9 years), previously enrolled in a long-term follow-up study. Symptom severity and symptom interference were assessed using the well-validated MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI). Fatigue was evaluated with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue questionnaire. RESULTS: Higher fatigue burden was associated with increased affective symptoms, memory problems, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, shortness of breath and pain. Higher levels of fatigue were also associated with higher scores across all interference items of the MDASI. Overall, symptoms interfered most with mood, but among APL survivors with high levels of fatigue, symptoms interfered most with enjoyment of life. Multivariable regression analysis confirmed the independent association between fatigue and all symptom severity items of the MDASI. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings show that long-term APL survivors who report higher fatigue also experience a greater overall symptom burden and a substantial impact on performance of daily activities. Further studies are needed to examine whether interventions aimed at reducing fatigue could also reduce overall symptom burden.","['Sommer, Kathrin', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Cottone, Francesco', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Annibali, Ombretta', 'Luppi, Mario', 'Intermesoli, Tamara', 'Borlenghi, Erika', 'Carluccio, Paola', 'Rodeghiero, Francesco', 'Fabbiano, Francesco', 'Romani, Claudio', 'Sborgia, Marco', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Crugnola, Monica', 'Efficace, Fabio']","['Sommer K', 'Vignetti M', 'Cottone F', 'Breccia M', 'Annibali O', 'Luppi M', 'Intermesoli T', 'Borlenghi E', 'Carluccio P', 'Rodeghiero F', 'Fabbiano F', 'Romani C', 'Sborgia M', 'Martino B', 'Crugnola M', 'Efficace F']","['Data Center and Health Outcomes Research Unit, Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases (GIMEMA), Roma, Italy.', 'Data Center and Health Outcomes Research Unit, Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases (GIMEMA), Roma, Italy.', 'Data Center and Health Outcomes Research Unit, Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases (GIMEMA), Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Roma, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Campus Bio-Medico University, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Section of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Policlinico, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (DETO), University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Hematology Project Foundation, Department of Hematology, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Ospedali Riuniti Villa Sofia - Cervello, Palermo, Italy.', 'UO Ematologia e Centro TMO, Ospedale Armando Businco, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Bone Marrow Transplant Center, Pescara, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli, Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Hematology, Parma University, Parma, Italy.', 'Data Center and Health Outcomes Research Unit, Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases (GIMEMA), Roma, Italy f.efficace@gimema.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMJ Support Palliat Care,BMJ supportive & palliative care,101565123,,IM,,['NOTNLM'],"['fatigue', 'leukaemia', 'quality of life', 'survivorship']",2020/07/19 06:00,2020/07/19 06:00,['2020/07/19 06:00'],"['2020/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['bmjspcare-2020-002281 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002281 [doi]']",aheadofprint,BMJ Support Palliat Care. 2020 Jul 17. pii: bmjspcare-2020-002281. doi: 10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002281.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3861-891X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0373-1154', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5065-5166']",20200717,,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 214 pediatric patients with low-risk AML were classified as having EMI (central nervous leukemia [CNSL] and/or myeloid sarcoma [MS]) and not having EMI. Patients with isolated MS before AML diagnosis by bone marrow examination were confirmed with histopathologic examination. For patients diagnosed with AML by bone marrow examination, a thorough physical examination and radiologic imaging were used to confirm MS. RESULTS: Male gender, a high white blood cell count, the FAB-M5 subtype, t(8;21) and t(1;11) abnormalities, and c-KIT mutations were associated with EMI. The presence of MS was associated with a low complete remission rate (63.6% vs. 79.4%; P = .000) and poor 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) (62.6% +/- 7.5% vs. 87.0% +/- 2.8%; P = .000) and 3-year overall survival (73.5% +/- 7% vs. 88.8% +/- 2.6%; P = .011). Multivariate analysis revealed that MS was a poor prognostic factor for RFS and overall survival. Bone infiltration was an independent risk factor for inferior RFS with MS. Patients with CNSL had a low complete remission rate (58.3% vs. 77.2%; P = .045); however, CNSL did not significantly affect the survival of low-risk patients with AML. CONCLUSION: MS should be considered an independent risk factor to guide stratified treatment.","['Hu, Guan-Hua', 'Lu, Ai-Dong', 'Jia, Yue-Ping', 'Zuo, Ying-Xi', 'Wu, Jun', 'Zhang, Le-Ping']","['Hu GH', 'Lu AD', 'Jia YP', 'Zuo YX', 'Wu J', 'Zhang LP']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing, China.

In about 25% of all AML patients, in-frame insertions are observed in the sequence. Most of those insertions are internal tandem duplications (ITDs) of a sequence from the protein. The characteristics of such mutations in terms of length, sequence, and location were hitherto studied in different populations, but not in a comprehensive mutation database. Here, in-frame insertions into the FLT3 gene were extracted from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. These were analyzed with respect to the length, location, and sequence of the mutations. Furthermore, characteristic strings (sequences) of different lengths were identified. Mutations were shown to occur most often in the juxtamembrane zipper (JM-Z) domain of FLT3, followed by the hinge domain and first tyrosine kinase domain (TKD1), upstream of the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop). Interestingly, there are specific hot spot residues where insertions are more likely to occur. The insertions vary in length between one and 67 amino acids, with the largest insertions spanning the phosphate binding loop. Insertions that occur downstream of the P-loop are shorter. Our analysis further shows that acidic and aromatic residues are enriched in the insertions. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations were run for FLT3 with ITD insertions in the hinge and tyrosine kinase domains. On the basis of the findings, a mechanism is proposed for activation by ITDs, according to which there is no direct coupling between the length of the insertion and the activity of the mutated protein. The effect of insertions on the sensitivity of FLT3 to kinase inhibitors is discussed based on our findings.","['Todde, Guido', 'Friedman, Ran']","['Todde G', 'Friedman R']","['Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Linnaeus University, 391 82 Kalmar, Sweden.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Linnaeus University, 391 82 Kalmar, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Chem Inf Model,Journal of chemical information and modeling,101230060,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Protein Domains', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2020/07/19 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/07/19 06:00'],"['2020/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00544 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chem Inf Model. 2020 Aug 24;60(8):4005-4020. doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00544.

In the present study, secalonic acid F (SAF), a naturally occurring ergochrome pigment, was studied for its cytotoxicity against various leukemia and multiple myeloma cells by the resazurin assay. SAF exhibited cytotoxic activity on both leukemia and multiple myeloma cells. Generally, multiple myeloma cells were more sensitive to SAF than leukemia cells. NCI-H929 cells were the most affected cells among the tested panel of multiple myeloma cell lines and were taken for further studies to assess the mode of action of SAF on those cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that SAF induced S and G2/M arrest in NCI-H929 cells. SAF-associated apoptosis and necrosis resulted in cytotoxicity. SAF further inclined the disassembly of the tubulin network, which may also account for its cytotoxicity. COMPARE and hierarchical cluster analyses of transcriptome-wide expression profiles of the NCI tumor cell line panel identified genes involved in numerous cellular processes (e.g., cell differentiation, cell migration, and other numerous signaling pathways) notably correlated with log10IC50 values for secalonic acid.

An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) with exploratory pathway analysis may help identify potential pyrethroid-related health effects. METHODS: We performed an exploratory EWAS of chronic ambient pyrethroid exposure using control participants' blood in the Parkinson's Environment and Genes Study in the Central Valley of California (N = 237). We estimated associations of living and working near agricultural pyrethroid pesticide applications in the past 5 years (binary) with site-specific differential methylation, and used a false discovery rate (FDR) cut off of 0.05 for significance. We controlled for age, sex, education, cell count, and an ancestral marker for Hispanic ethnicity. We normalized methylation values for Type I/II probe bias using Beta-Mixture Quantile (BMIQ) normalization, filtered out cross-reactive probes, and evaluated for remaining bias with Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA). We also evaluated the effects of controlling for cell count and normalizing for Type I/II probe bias by comparing changes in effect estimates and p-values for the top hits across BMIQ and GenomeStudio normalization methods, and controlling for cell count. To facilitate broader interpretation, we annotated genes to the CpG sites and performed gene set overrepresentation analysis, using genes annotated to CpG sites that were associated with pyrethroids at a raw p < 0.05, and controlling for background representation of CpG sites on the chip. We did this for both a biological process context (Gene Ontology terms) using missMethyl, and a disease set context using WebGestalt. For these gene set overrepresentation analyses we also used an FDR cut off of 0.05 for significance of gene sets. RESULTS: After controlling for cell count and applying BMIQ normalization, 4 CpG sites were differentially methylated in relation to pyrethroid exposures. When using GenomeStudio's Illumina normalization, 415 CpG sites were differentially methylated, including all four identified with the BMIQ method. In the gene set overrepresentation analyses, we identified 6 GO terms using BMIQ normalization, and 76 using Illumina normalization, including the 6 identified by BMIQ. For disease sets, we identified signals for Alzheimer's disease, leukemia and several other cancers, diabetes, birth defects, and other diseases, for both normalization methods. We identified minimal changes in effect estimates after controlling for cell count, and controlling for cell count generally weakened p-values. BMIQ normalization, however, resulted in different beta coefficients and weakened p-values. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic ambient pyrethroid exposure is associated with differential methylation at CpG sites that annotate to a wide variety of disease states and biological mechanisms that align with prior research. However, this EWAS also implicates several novel diseases for future investigation, and highlights the relative importance of different background normalization methods in identifying associations.","['Furlong, Melissa A', 'Paul, Kimberly C', 'Yan, Qi', 'Chuang, Yu-Hsuan', 'Cockburn, Myles G', 'Bronstein, Jeff M', 'Horvath, Steve', 'Ritz, Beate']","['Furlong MA', 'Paul KC', 'Yan Q', 'Chuang YH', 'Cockburn MG', 'Bronstein JM', 'Horvath S', 'Ritz B']","['Department of Community, Environment, and Policy, University of Arizona Mel and Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health, Tucson, AZ, USA.

Although some have reported associations between individual infections and immune cell malignancies, some could be spurious due to infections caused by malignancies that were already active prior to diagnosis. METHODS: Identified from Taiwan Cancer Registry, approximately 3000 children with four commonest immune cell malignancies diagnosed during 2001-2015 at age 1-20 years were identified and matched with 1:10 controls. Using logistic regression, we estimated the time-specific case-versus-control odds ratios of seven common infection presentations in their health records. We also compared recorded unexplained lymph nodes between cases and controls to explore for how long malignancy may be active prior to diagnosis. RESULTS: Unexplained lymph nodes were increasingly recorded months before the diagnosis of childhood leukaemias and years before the diagnosis of childhood lymphomas. When using p < 0.01 as a guide, large case-control differences in infection records were found mostly within 0-2 months prior to the diagnosis (15 out of 28 comparisons). Changes in odds ratios within 3-35 months (2 out of 28 comparisons) and case-control differences beyond 36+ months prior to diagnosis (7 out of 28 comparisons) was relatively small ( approximately 10 % difference in leukaemias). Statistical power varied according to incidence of malignancy, incidence of infection records, and the age distribution. CONCLUSION: Immune cell malignancies were likely to be active some time before the diagnosis. Previous studies using conventional population-based methods may not be able to distinguish any small causal link between infection and immune cell malignancies from spurious associations.","['Yang, TienYu Owen', 'Huang, Kuan-Ying Arthur', 'Chen, Mei-Huei', 'Chen, Pau-Chung', 'Huang, Wan-Ting']","['Yang TO', 'Huang KA', 'Chen MH', 'Chen PC', 'Huang WT']","['Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Richard Doll Building, Old Road Campus, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.

SKP2, an E3 ligase, is a downstream factor of Bcr-Abl to motivate the cell cycle transition of CML and also found to bind and activate Bcr-Abl in reverse. Therefore, SKP2/Bcr-Abl pathway is an attractive target for CML treatment. This study aims to identify an inhibitor of the SKP2/Bcr-Abl pathway based on a large screening of the natural products. We demonstrate that Diosmetin, a kind of phytoestrogens, notably downregulates the expression of SKP2, Bcr-Abl phosphorylation, and moderately downregulates the Bcr-Abl level. Furthermore, Diosmetin displays a favorable anti-tumor activity in CML cells and xenograft models. Collectively, our study reveals a natural compound in the treatment of CML on the basis of SKP2/Bcr-Abl signaling pathway.","['Liu, Yuan', 'Shao, Zhenlong', 'Liao, Yuning', 'Xia, Xiaohong', 'Huang, Chuyi', 'He, Jinchan', 'Hu, Tumei', 'Yu, Cuifu', 'Jiang, Lili', 'Liu, Jinbao', 'Huang, Hongbiao']","['Liu Y', 'Shao Z', 'Liao Y', 'Xia X', 'Huang C', 'He J', 'Hu T', 'Yu C', 'Jiang L', 'Liu J', 'Huang H']","['Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510095, China; Guangzhou Municipal and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 511436, China.', 'Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510095, China; Guangzhou Municipal and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 511436, China.', 'Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510095, China; Guangzhou Municipal and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 511436, China.', 'Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510095, China; Guangzhou Municipal and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 511436, China.', 'Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510095, China; Guangzhou Municipal and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 511436, China.', 'Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510095, China; Guangzhou Municipal and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 511436, China.', 'Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510095, China; Guangzhou Municipal and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 511436, China.', 'Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510095, China; Guangzhou Municipal and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 511436, China.', 'Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510095, China; Guangzhou Municipal and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 511436, China.', 'Affiliated Cancer Hospital & Institute of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510095, China; Guangzhou Municipal and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Protein Modification and Degradation, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 511436, China.

We aimed to identify risk factors for COVID-19 severity and assess outcomes in patients where COVID-19 complicated the treatment of their haematological disorder. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 55 patients with haematological disorders and COVID-19, including 52 with malignancy, two with bone marrow failure and one immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). COVID-19 diagnosis coincided with a new diagnosis of a haematological malignancy in four patients. Among patients, 82% were on systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Of hospitalised patients, 37% (19/51) died while all four outpatients recovered. Risk factors for severe disease or mortality were similar to those in other published cohorts. Raised C-reactive protein at diagnosis predicted an aggressive clinical course. The majority of patients recovered from COVID-19, despite receiving recent SACT. This suggests that SACT, where urgent, should be administered despite intercurrent COVID-19 infection, which should be managed according to standard pathways. Delay or modification of therapy should be considered on an individual basis. Long-term follow-up studies in larger patient cohorts are required to assess the efficacy of treatment strategies employed during the pandemic.","['Fox, Thomas A', 'Troy-Barnes, Ethan', 'Kirkwood, Amy A', 'Chan, Wei Yee', 'Day, James W', 'Chavda, Selina J', 'Kumar, Emil A', 'David, Kate', 'Tomkins, Oliver', 'Sanchez, Emilie', 'Scully, Marie', 'Khwaja, Asim', 'Lambert, Jonathan', 'Singer, Mervyn', 'Roddie, Claire', 'Morris, Emma C', 'Yong, Kwee L', 'Thomson, Kirsty J', 'Ardeshna, Kirit M']","['Fox TA', 'Troy-Barnes E', 'Kirkwood AA', 'Chan WY', 'Day JW', 'Chavda SJ', 'Kumar EA', 'David K', 'Tomkins O', 'Sanchez E', 'Scully M', 'Khwaja A', 'Lambert J', 'Singer M', 'Roddie C', 'Morris EC', 'Yong KL', 'Thomson KJ', 'Ardeshna KM']","['Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'UCL Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'CR UK & UCL Cancer Trials Centre, UCL Cancer Institute, UCL, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'UCL Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Centre for Cancer Genomics and Computational Biology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Department of Clinical Virology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Department of Clinical Virology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'UCLH NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'UCLH NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.', 'UCLH NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.', 'Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, UCL, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'UCLH NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'UCL Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL, London, UK.', 'UCLH NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.', 'Department Immunology, Royal Free London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', 'UCLH NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'UCLH NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'UCLH NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Blacks', 'COVID-19/*complications/mortality/therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Cross Infection/complications', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'London/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Thrombophilia/drug therapy/etiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Covid-19', '*chemotherapy', '*risk factors']",2020/07/18 06:00,2020/12/19 06:00,['2020/07/18 06:00'],"['2020/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.17027 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Oct;191(2):194-206. doi: 10.1111/bjh.17027.

Clinical features are heterogeneous among patients with CEP but usually combine skin photosensitivity and chronic hemolytic anemia, the severity of which is related to porphyrin overload. Therapeutic options include symptomatic strategies only and are unsatisfactory. One promising approach to treating CEP is to reduce the erythroid production of porphyrins through substrate reduction therapy by inhibiting 5-aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. We efficiently reduced porphyrin accumulation after RNA interference-mediated downregulation of ALAS2 in human erythroid cellular models of CEP disease. Taking advantage of the physiological iron-dependent posttranscriptional regulation of ALAS2, we evaluated whether iron chelation with deferiprone could decrease ALAS2 expression and subsequent porphyrin production in vitro and in vivo in a CEP murine model. Treatment with deferiprone of UROS-deficient erythroid cell lines and peripheral blood CD34+-derived erythroid cultures from a patient with CEP inhibited iron-dependent protein ALAS2 and iron-responsive element-binding protein 2 expression and reduced porphyrin production. Furthermore, porphyrin accumulation progressively decreased in red blood cells and urine, and skin photosensitivity in CEP mice treated with deferiprone (1 or 3 mg/mL in drinking water) for 26 weeks was reversed. Hemolysis and iron overload improved upon iron chelation with full correction of anemia in CEP mice treated at the highest dose of deferiprone.

Many evidences indicate that Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is not completely silent in vivo. However, signals that trigger HTLV-1 latency-reactivation switching remain poorly understood. Here, we show that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, plays a critical role in HTLV-1 plus-strand expression. Importantly, HTLV-1 reactivation could be tunably manipulated by modulating the level of AHR ligands. Mechanistically, activated AHR binds to HTLV-1 LTR dioxin response element (DRE) site (CACGCATAT) and drives plus-strand transcription. On the other hand, persistent activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway constitutes one key prerequisite for AHR overexpression in HTLV-1 infected T-cells, setting the stage for the advent of AHR signaling. Our findings suggest that HTLV-1 might achieve its reactivation in vivo when encountering environmental, dietary, microbial and metabolic cues that induce sufficient AHR signaling.","['Hong, Weihao', 'Cheng, Wenzhao', 'Zheng, Tingjin', 'Jiang, Nan', 'Xu, Ruian']","['Hong W', 'Cheng W', 'Zheng T', 'Jiang N', 'Xu R']","['School of Medicine, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou, China.', 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine & Xiamen Key Lab of Marine and Gene Drugs, Xiamen, China.', 'School of Medicine, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou, China.', 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine & Xiamen Key Lab of Marine and Gene Drugs, Xiamen, China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Molecular Medicine, Ministry of Education, Xiamen, China.', 'School of Medicine, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou, China.', 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine & Xiamen Key Lab of Marine and Gene Drugs, Xiamen, China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Molecular Medicine, Ministry of Education, Xiamen, China.', 'School of Medicine, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou, China.', 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine & Xiamen Key Lab of Marine and Gene Drugs, Xiamen, China.', 'School of Medicine, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou, China.', 'Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine & Xiamen Key Lab of Marine and Gene Drugs, Xiamen, China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Molecular Medicine, Ministry of Education, Xiamen, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (AHR protein, human)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'HTLV-I Infections/metabolism/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Virus Activation/*physiology', 'Virus Latency/*physiology']",,,2020/07/18 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2020/07/18 06:00'],"['2020/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1008664 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-20-00144 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2020 Jul 17;16(7):e1008664. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008664. eCollection 2020 Jul.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1339-3160'],20200717,,,,PMC7367443,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A primary challenge of this problem is the prohibitively high computational cost when dealing with large-scale networks. We attempt to develop a more efficient approach from a novel graph-theoretical perspective. First, a weighted directed graph structure called the optimal state transition graph (OSTG) is established, whose edges encode the optimal action for each admissible state transition between states reachable from a given initial state subject to various constraints. Then, we reduce the IHOC problem into a minimum-mean cycle (MMC) problem in the OSTG. Finally, we develop an algorithm that can quickly find a particular MMC by resorting to Karp's algorithm in the graph theory and construct an optimal switching control law based on state feedback. The time complexity analysis shows that our algorithm, albeit still running in exponential time, can outperform all the existing methods in terms of time efficiency. A 16-state-3-input signaling network in leukemia is used as a benchmark to test its effectiveness. Results show that the proposed graph-theoretical approach is much more computationally efficient and can reduce the running time dramatically: it runs hundreds or even thousands of times faster than the existing methods. The Python implementation of the algorithm is available at https://github.com/ShuhuaGao/sbcn_mmc.","['Gao, Shuhua', 'Sun, Changkai', 'Xiang, Cheng', 'Qin, Kairong', 'Lee, Tong Heng']","['Gao S', 'Sun C', 'Xiang C', 'Qin K', 'Lee TH']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,IEEE Trans Cybern,IEEE transactions on cybernetics,101609393,,IM,,,,2020/07/18 06:00,2020/07/18 06:00,['2020/07/18 06:00'],"['2020/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1109/TCYB.2020.3003552 [doi]'],aheadofprint,IEEE Trans Cybern. 2020 Jul 17;PP. doi: 10.1109/TCYB.2020.3003552.,,20200717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a pooled analysis of cohort studies, we found that carriers of the IL13rs1295686A/A genotype had an increased risk of AML (PCorr = 0.0144) whereas carriers of the VEGFArs25648T allele had a decreased risk of developing the disease (PCorr = 0.00086). In addition, we found an association of the IL8rs2227307 SNP with a decreased risk of developing AML that remained marginally significant after multiple testing (PCorr = 0.072). Functional experiments suggested that the effect of the IL13rs1295686 SNP on AML risk might be explained by its role in regulating IL1Ra secretion that modulates AML blast proliferation. Likewise, the protective effect of the IL8rs2227307 SNP might be mediated by TLR2-mediated immune responses that affect AML blast viability, proliferation and chemorresistance. Despite the potential interest of these results, additional functional studies are still warranted to unravel the mechanisms by which these variants modulate the risk of AML. These findings suggested that IL13, VEGFA and IL8 SNPs play a role in modulating AML risk.","['Sanchez-Maldonado, J M', 'Campa, D', 'Springer, J', 'Badiola, J', 'Niazi, Y', 'Moniz-Diez, A', 'Hernandez-Mohedo, F', 'Gonzalez-Sierra, P', 'Ter Horst, R', 'Macauda, A', 'Brezina, S', 'Cunha, C', 'Lackner, M', 'Lopez-Nevot, M A', 'Fianchi, L', 'Pagano, L', 'Lopez-Fernandez, E', 'Potenza, L', 'Luppi, M', 'Moratalla, L', 'Rodriguez-Sevilla, J J', 'Fonseca, J E', 'Tormo, M', 'Solano, C', 'Clavero, E', 'Romero, A', 'Li, Y', 'Lass-Florl, C', 'Einsele, H', 'Vazquez, L', 'Loeffler, J', 'Hemminki, K', 'Carvalho, A', 'Netea, M G', 'Gsur, A', 'Dumontet, C', 'Canzian, F', 'Forsti, A', 'Jurado, M', 'Sainz, J']","['Sanchez-Maldonado JM', 'Campa D', 'Springer J', 'Badiola J', 'Niazi Y', 'Moniz-Diez A', 'Hernandez-Mohedo F', 'Gonzalez-Sierra P', 'Ter Horst R', 'Macauda A', 'Brezina S', 'Cunha C', 'Lackner M', 'Lopez-Nevot MA', 'Fianchi L', 'Pagano L', 'Lopez-Fernandez E', 'Potenza L', 'Luppi M', 'Moratalla L', 'Rodriguez-Sevilla JJ', 'Fonseca JE', 'Tormo M', 'Solano C', 'Clavero E', 'Romero A', 'Li Y', 'Lass-Florl C', 'Einsele H', 'Vazquez L', 'Loeffler J', 'Hemminki K', 'Carvalho A', 'Netea MG', 'Gsur A', 'Dumontet C', 'Canzian F', 'Forsti A', 'Jurado M', 'Sainz J']","['Genomic Oncology Area, GENYO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research: Pfizer / University of Granada / Andalusian Regional Government, PTS Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Hematology department, Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital, Granada, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Biosanitaria de Granada (ibs.Granada), Complejo Hospitales Universitarios de Granada/Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Medizinische Klinik II, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Hematology department, Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital, Granada, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Biosanitaria de Granada (ibs.Granada), Complejo Hospitales Universitarios de Granada/Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Hopp Children's Cancer Center (KiTZ), Heidelberg, Germany."", 'Division of Pediatric Neurooncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genomic Oncology Area, GENYO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research: Pfizer / University of Granada / Andalusian Regional Government, PTS Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Hematology department, Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital, Granada, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Biosanitaria de Granada (ibs.Granada), Complejo Hospitales Universitarios de Granada/Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Hematology department, Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital, Granada, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Biosanitaria de Granada (ibs.Granada), Complejo Hospitales Universitarios de Granada/Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Hematology department, Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital, Granada, Spain.', 'Instituto de Investigacion Biosanitaria de Granada (ibs.Granada), Complejo Hospitales Universitarios de Granada/Universidad de Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Radboud Center for Infectious Diseases, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Genomic Epidemiology Group, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Cancer Research, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Medicine, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', ""ICVS/3B's - PT Government Associate Laboratory, Braga/Guimaraes, Guimaraes, Portugal."", 'Division of Hygiene and Medical Microbiology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Immunology department, Virgen de las Nieves University Hospital, Granada, Spain.', 'Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del S.

It plays an integral role in various immune responses as well as autoimmunity, by sending a potent ""don't eat me"" signal to prevent phagocytosis. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that CD47 is overexpressed in various hematological malignancies and its interaction with SIRPalpha on the phagocytic cells prevents phagocytosis of cancer cells. Additionally, it is expressed by different cell types in the tumor microenvironment and is required for establishing tumor metastasis. Overexpression of CD47 is thus often associated with poor clinical outcomes. CD47 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target and is being investigated in various preclinical studies as well as clinical trials to prove its safety and efficacy in treating hematological neoplasms. This review focuses on different therapeutic mechanisms to target CD47, either alone or in combination with other cell surface markers, and its pivotal role in impairing tumor growth and metastatic spread of various types of hematological malignancies.","['Eladl, Entsar', 'Tremblay-LeMay, Rosemarie', 'Rastgoo, Nasrin', 'Musani, Rumina', 'Chen, Wenming', 'Liu, Aijun', 'Chang, Hong']","['Eladl E', 'Tremblay-LeMay R', 'Rastgoo N', 'Musani R', 'Chen W', 'Liu A', 'Chang H']","['Laboratory Medicine Program, Toronto General Hospital, University Health Network, University of Toronto, 11th floor, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C4, Canada.', 'Laboratory Medicine Program, Toronto General Hospital, University Health Network, University of Toronto, 11th floor, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C4, Canada.', 'Laboratory Medicine Program, Toronto General Hospital, University Health Network, University of Toronto, 11th floor, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C4, Canada.', 'Laboratory Medicine Program, Toronto General Hospital, University Health Network, University of Toronto, 11th floor, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C4, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital University, Beijing, China. aijun.liu72@yahoo.com.', 'Laboratory Medicine Program, Toronto General Hospital, University Health Network, University of Toronto, 11th floor, 200 Elizabeth Street, Toronto, ON, M5G 2C4, Canada. hong.chang@uhn.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Angiogenic Proteins)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (CD47 protein, human)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (SIRPA protein, human)']",IM,"['Angiogenic Proteins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Differentiation/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/therapeutic use', 'CD47 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Molecular Mimicry', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Oligopeptides/therapeutic use', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Receptors, Immunologic/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CD47', '*Hematological cancers', '*Immunotherapy', '*Targeted therapy']",2020/07/18 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2020/07/18 06:00'],"['2020/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-020-00930-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-020-00930-1 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2020 Jul 16;13(1):96. doi: 10.1186/s13045-020-00930-1.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3106-2776'],20200716,,,,PMC7364564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: RPMI-8226 and U266 cells were treated by GANT61 (0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0 mumol/L) for 18, 24 and 36 hours (h), and cell proliferation was detected by Cell Counting Kit 8. Then these cells were treated by GANT61 at 0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 mumol/L for 24 h or treated by 10.0 mumol/L GANT61 for 0, 18, 24 and 36 h, and cell apoptosis rate, apoptosis markers and cell cycle were detected by AV/PI, Western blot, and PI staining. Notch1, Jagged1, Jagged2 and Hes1 expressions were detected by qPCR and Western blot. Further rescue experiments were conducted by upregulating Notch1. Results: In RPMI-8226 and U266 cells, GANT61 inhibited cell proliferation, increased cell apoptosis rate and cell percentage of G1/G0 phase while decreased cell percentage of S phase in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Besides, GANT61 inhibited Notch1, Jagged1, Jagged2 and Hes1 expressions in a dose- and time-dependent manner as well. In rescue experiments, Notch1 upregulation attenuated the inhibition of cell proliferation, promotion of cell apoptosis, induction of G1/G0 cycle retardation and repression of Notch signaling pathway induced by GANT61 treatment in RPMI-8226 and U266 cells. Conclusions: GANT61 suppresses cell proliferation, promotes cell apoptosis and induces G1/G0 cycle retardation with a dose- and time-dependent manner through inhibiting Notch pathway in MM.

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate the performance of the commercialized Oncomine myeloid research assay (OMA) for myeloid neoplasms. METHODS: Certified reference materials and clinical research samples were used, including 60 genomic DNA and 56 RNA samples. NGS was performed using OMA, which enables the interrogation of 40 target genes, 29 gene fusions, and five expression target genes with five expression control genes by the Ion S5 XL Sequencer. The analyzed data were compared with clinical data using karyotyping, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization, Sanger sequencing, customized NGS panel, and fragment analysis. RESULTS: All targets of reference materials were detected except three (two ASXL1 and one CEBPA) mutations, which we had not expected OMA to detect. In clinical search samples, OMA satisfactorily identified DNA variants, including 90 single nucleotide variants (SNVs), 48 small insertions and deletions (indels), and eight FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs) (Kappa agreement 0.938). The variant allele frequencies of SNVs and indels measured by OMA correlated well with clinical data, whereas those of FLT3-ITDs were significantly lower than with fragment analysis (P = 0.008). Together, OMA showed strong ability to identify RNA gene fusions (Kappa agreement 0.961), except one RUNX1-MECOM. The MECOM gene was highly expressed in all five samples with MECOM-associated rearrangements, including inv(3), t(3;3), and t(3;21). CONCLUSION: OMA revealed excellent analytical and potential clinical performance and could be a good replacement for conventional molecular tests.","['Park, Joonhong', 'Kim, Hoon Seok', 'Lee,

Don in adverse-risk acute myeloid leukaemia.,2351-2365,10.1007/s11030-020-10124-z [doi],"A poor prognosis, relapse and resistance are burning issues during adverse-risk acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) treatment. As a natural medicine, Scutellaria barbata D. Don (SBD) has shown impressive antitumour activity in various cancers. Thus, SBD may become a potential drug in adverse-risk AML treatment. This study aimed to screen the key targets of SBD in adverse-risk AML using the drug-biomarker interaction model through bioinformatics and network pharmacology methods. First, the adverse-risk AML-related critical biomarkers and targets of SBD active ingredient were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and several pharmacophore matching databases. Next, the protein-protein interaction network was constructed, and topological analysis and pathway enrichment were used to screen key targets and main pathways of intervention of SBD in adverse-risk AML. Finally, molecular docking was implemented for key target verification. The results suggest that luteolin and quercetin are the main active components of SBD against adverse-risk AML, and affected drug resistance, apoptosis, immune regulation and angiogenesis through the core targets AKT1, MAPK1, IL6, EGFR, SRC, VEGFA and TP53. We hope the proposed drug-biomarker interaction model provides an effective strategy for the research and development of antitumour drugs.","['Wang, Teng', 'Lyu, Chun-Yi', 'Jiang, Yue-Hua', 'Dong, Xue-Yan', 'Wang, Yan', 'Li, Zong-Hong', 'Wang, Jin-Xin', 'Xu, Rui-Rong']","['Wang T', 'Lyu CY', 'Jiang YH', 'Dong XY', 'Wang Y', 'Li ZH', 'Wang JX', 'Xu RR']","[""Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, 250014, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, 250014, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Central Laboratory of Affiliated Hospital of Shandong, University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, 250014, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, 250014, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, 250014, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, 250014, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, 250014, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, 250014, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China. shandongxuruirong@163.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mol Divers,Molecular diversity,9516534,,IM,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukaemia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cytogenetics risk category', 'Network pharmacology', 'Scutellaria barbata D.

Retrospective studies have suggested that acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) regimens are more effective than acute myeloid leukemia (AML) regimens. We retrospectively examined the effectiveness of the widely-used adult ALL regimen hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyperCVAD) as initial therapy in patients with ALAL at five academic institutions. Twenty-five patients were identified, including 23 with mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) and two with acute undifferentiated leukemia. Five of 8 tested (63%) had FLT3-ITD and 3 of 25 (12%) were Philadelphia chromosome-positive. The complete remission (CR) rate was 76%, with CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) in an additional 8%, for an overall response rate of 84%. Median number of cycles to CR/CRi was 1. There were no deaths in the first 30 days. Of the 21 patients achieving CR or CRi, 14 (66%) proceeded to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. With a median follow-up time of 31.6 months, median overall survival for the entire cohort was not reached, and the estimated 2-year survival was 63%. HyperCVAD can be considered an effective and tolerable front-line regimen for patients with ALAL, and warrants further prospective study.","['Duong, Vu H', 'Begna, Kebede H', 'Kashanian, Sarah', 'Sweet, Kendra', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Caddell, Ryan', 'Shafer, Danielle A', 'Singh, Zeba N', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Al-Kali, Aref']","['Duong VH', 'Begna KH', 'Kashanian S', 'Sweet K', 'Wang ES', 'Caddell R', 'Shafer DA', 'Singh ZN', 'Baer MR', 'Al-Kali A']","['University of Maryland School of Medicine and Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, 22 S.

CircRNAs expressed in the hematopoietic compartment have been increasingly recognized as modulators of physiological and pathological features of hematopoetic stem cell (HSC)-derived populations. In particular, several circRNAs were found to enhance or suppress tumor progression in blood malignancies such as leukemias and lymphomas. Moreover, numerous circRNAs have been proposed to help confer resistance to the conventional treatments used in hematopoietic cancers. Here, we review the most important circRNAs described thus far in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lymphomas, and multiple myeloma (MM). We discuss the usefulness of circRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic markers and their potential value as therapeutic targets.","['Perez de Acha, Olivia', 'Rossi, Martina', 'Gorospe, Myriam']","['Perez de Acha O', 'Rossi M', 'Gorospe M']","['Laboratory of Genetics and Genomics, National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Laboratory of Genetics and Genomics, National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Laboratory of Genetics and Genomics, National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program, National Institutes of Health, Baltimore, MD, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Mol Biosci,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,101653173,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['blood malignancies', 'circular RNAs', 'leukemias', 'lymphomas', 'non-coding RNA']",2020/07/18 06:00,2020/07/18 06:01,['2020/07/18 06:00'],"['2020/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmolb.2020.00109 [doi]'],epublish,Front Mol Biosci. 2020 Jun 26;7:109. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2020.00109. eCollection 2020.,,20200626,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Perez de Acha, Rossi and Gorospe.']",,PMC7333357,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDR is a major obstacle to the success of cancer chemotherapy. The mechanism of MDR involves active drug efflux transport of ABC superfamily of proteins such as Pglycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2/ABCC2), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) that weaken the effectiveness of chemotherapeutics and negative impact on the future of anticancer therapy. In this review, the authors aim to provide an overview of various multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms observed in cancer cells as well as the various strategies developed to overcome these MDR. Extensive studies have been carried out since last several years to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy by defeating these MDR mechanisms with the use of novel anticancer drugs that could escape from the efflux reaction, MDR modulators or chemosensitizers, multifunctional nanotechnology, and RNA interference (RNAi) therapy.","['Gupta, Sonu Kumar', 'Singh, Priyanka', 'Ali, Villayat', 'Verma, Malkhey']","['Gupta SK', 'Singh P', 'Ali V', 'Verma M']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Basic & Applied Sciences, Central University of Punjab, Punjab, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Basic & Applied Sciences, Central University of Punjab, Punjab, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Basic & Applied Sciences, Central University of Punjab, Punjab, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Basic & Applied Sciences, Central University of Punjab, Punjab, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Oncol Rev,Oncology reviews,101519906,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABC transporter', 'P-glycoprotein', 'breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)', 'chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'multidrug resistance (MDR)']",2020/07/18 06:00,2020/07/18 06:01,['2020/07/18 06:00'],"['2019/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4081/oncol.2020.448 [doi]'],epublish,Oncol Rev. 2020 Jul 6;14(2):448. doi: 10.4081/oncol.2020.448. eCollection 2020 Jul 6.,,20200706,,['(c)Copyright: the Author(s).'],,PMC7358983,,,['Conflicts of interest: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal B cell development and function cause a variety of hematological malignancies such as myeloma, B cell lymphoma, and leukemia. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors alone or in combination with other drugs have shown efficacy in several hematological malignancies, including those resistant to targeted therapies. Mechanistically, HDAC6 inhibitors promote malignant tumor cell apoptosis by inhibiting protein degradation, reinvigorating anti-tumor immunity, and inhibiting cell survival signaling pathways. Due to their specificity, HDAC6 inhibitors represent a very promising and feasible new development pipeline for high-efficacy drugs with limited side effects. This article reviews recent progress in the mechanisms of action of HDAC6 inhibitors for the treatment of B cell-associated hematological malignancies, such as multiple myeloma and B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which are often resistant to targeted therapies.","['Yang, Jia', 'Li, Dengwen', 'Zhou, Jun']","['Yang J', 'Li D', 'Zhou J']","['State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Resistance Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cell Biology in Universities of Shandong, College of Life Sciences, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B lymphocyte', 'B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'hematological malignancy', 'histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)', 'inhibitor', 'multiple myeloma', 'therapy']",2020/07/18 06:00,2020/07/18 06:01,['2020/07/18 06:00'],"['2020/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2020.00971 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Jun 26;11:971. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2020.00971. eCollection 2020.,,20200626,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Yang, Li and Zhou.']",,PMC7333221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: FGD5-AS1 was significantly increased in OC tissues and cells. Loss of FGD5-AS1 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of OC cells. FGD5-AS1 acted as a sponge of miR-153-3p, and MCL1 was direct target of miR-153-3p. Forced expression of miR-153-3p or inhibition of MCL1 reversed the promoted role of FGD5-AS1 on OC cells' migration and invasion. The in vivo tumor growth assay showed that FGD5-AS1 promoted OC tumorigenesis by regulating miR-153-3p/MCL1 axis. CONCLUSIONS: Our research revealed lncRNA FGD5-AS1 acted as an oncogene by regulating MCL1 via sponging miR-153-3p, thus providing some novel experimental basis for clinical treatment or prevention of OC.

However, the mutational dynamics and clonal evolution underlying disease progression are poorly understood at present. To elucidate the mutational dynamics of pathways and genes occurring during the evolution to sAML, next generation sequencing was performed on 84 serially paired samples of MDS patients who developed sAML (discovery cohort) and 14 paired samples from MDS patients who did not progress to sAML during follow-up (control cohort). Results were validated in an independent series of 388 MDS patients (validation cohort). We used an integrative analysis to identify how mutations, alone or in combination, contribute to leukemic transformation. The study showed that MDS progression to sAML is characterized by greater genomic instability and the presence of several types of mutational dynamics, highlighting increasing (STAG2) and newly-acquired (NRAS and FLT3) mutations. Moreover, we observed cooperation between genes involved in the cohesin and Ras pathways in 15-20% of MDS patients who evolved to sAML, as well as a high proportion of newly acquired or increasing mutations in the chromatin-modifier genes in MDS patients receiving a disease-modifying therapy before their progression to sAML.","['Martin-Izquierdo, Marta', 'Abaigar, Maria', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Jesus M', 'Tamborero, David', 'Lopez-Cadenas, Felix', 'Ramos, Fernando', 'Lumbreras, Eva', 'Madinaveitia-Ochoa, Andres', 'Megido, Marta', 'Labrador, Jorge', 'Sanchez-Real, Javier', 'Olivier, Carmen', 'Davila, Julio', 'Aguilar, Carlos', 'Rodriguez, Juan N', 'Martin-Nunez, Guillermo', 'Santos-Minguez, Sandra', 'Miguel-Garcia, Cristina', 'Benito, Rocio', 'Diez-Campelo, Maria', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M']","['Martin-Izquierdo M', 'Abaigar M', 'Hernandez-Sanchez JM', 'Tamborero D', 'Lopez-Cadenas F', 'Ramos F', 'Lumbreras E', 'Madinaveitia-Ochoa A', 'Megido M', 'Labrador J', 'Sanchez-Real J', 'Olivier C', 'Davila J', 'Aguilar C', 'Rodriguez JN', 'Martin-Nunez G', 'Santos-Minguez S', 'Miguel-Garcia C', 'Benito R', 'Diez-Campelo M', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM']","['Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Cancer Research Center-University of Salamanca, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Cancer Research Center-University of Salamanca, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Cancer Research Center-University of Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute (IMIM), Barcelona and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm.', 'University of Salamanca, IBSAL, Hematology, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Leon, Institute of Biomedicine (IBIOMED), Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Cancer Research Center-University of Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital del Bierzo, Ponferrada, Leon, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Burgos, Burgos, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Leon, Institute of Biomedicine (IBIOMED), Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital General de Segovia, Segovia, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital Nuestra Senora de Sonsoles, Avila, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital Santa Barbara, Soria, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital Juan Ramon Jimenez, Huelva, Spain.', 'Hematology, Hospital Virgen del Puerto, Plasencia, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Cancer Research Center-University of Salamanca, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Cancer Research Center-University of Salamanca, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Cancer Research Center-University of Salamanca, Spain.', 'University of Salamanca, IBSAL, Hematology, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca, Cancer Research Center-University of Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (cohesins)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mutation', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary']",,,2020/07/18 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2020/07/18 06:00'],"['2020/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2020.248807 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2020.248807 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Aug 1;106(8):2215-2223. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.248807.,,20210801,,,,PMC8327724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunosuppressive treatment for graft-versus-host disease can impair the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia effect and facilitate malignancy relapse. Therefore, novel approaches that protect and regenerate injured tissues without impeding the donor immune system are needed. Bile acids regulate multiple cellular processes and are in close contact with the intestinal epithelium, a major target of acute graft-versus-host disease. Here, we found that the bile acid pool is reduced following graft-versus-host disease induction in a preclinical model. We evaluated the efficacy of bile acids to protect the intestinal epithelium without reducing anti-tumor immunity. We observed that application of bile acids decreased cytokine-induced cell death in intestinal organoids and cell lines. Systemic prophylactic administration of tauroursodeoxycholic acid, the most potent compound in our in vitro studies, reduced graft-versus-host disease severity in three different murine transplantation models. This effect was mediated by decreased activity of the antigen presentation machinery and subsequent prevention of apoptosis of the intestinal epithelium. Moreover, bile acid administration did not alter the bacterial composition in the intestine suggesting that its effects are cell-specific and independent of the microbiome. Treatment of human and murine leukemic cell lines with tauroursodeoxycholic acid did not interfere with the expression of antigen presentation-related molecules. Systemic T cell expansion and especially their cytotoxic capacity against leukemic cells remained intact. This study establishes a role for bile acids in the prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease without impairing the graft-versus-leukemia effect. In particular, we provide a scientific rationale for the systematic use of tauroursodeoxycholic acid in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.","['Haring, Eileen', 'Uhl, Franziska M', 'Andrieux, Geoffroy', 'Proietti, Michele', 'Bulashevska, Alla', 'Sauer, Barbara', 'Braun, Lukas M', 'de Vega Gomez, Enrique', 'Esser, Philipp R', 'Martin, Stefan F', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Follo, Marie', 'Schmitt-Graeff, Annette', 'Buescher, Joerg', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Grimbacher, Bodo', 'Boerries, Melanie', 'Pearce, Erika L', 'Zeiser, Robert', 'Apostolova, Petya']","['Haring E', 'Uhl FM', 'Andrieux G', 'Proietti M', 'Bulashevska A', 'Sauer B', 'Braun LM', 'de Vega Gomez E', 'Esser PR', 'Martin SF', 'Pfeifer D', 'Follo M', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Buescher J', 'Duyster J', 'Grimbacher B', 'Boerries M', 'Pearce EL', 'Zeiser R', 'Apostolova P']","['Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Bioinformatics and Systems Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Immunodeficiency, CCI, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Immunodeficiency, CCI, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Max-Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Max-Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Bile Acids and Salts)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Bile Acids and Salts', '*Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Intestines', '*Leukemia', 'Mice', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2020/07/18 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2020/07/18 06:00'],"['2019/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.242990 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.242990 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Aug 1;106(8):2131-2146. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.242990.,,20210801,,,,PMC8327708,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interventions to lower triglycerides have been considered, but there have been no pre-clinical studies investigating impact of lowering triglycerides on osteonecrosis risk, nor whether such interventions interfere with the antileukemic efficacy of ALL treatment. We utilized our clinically relevant mouse model of dexamethasone-induced osteonecrosis to determine if fenofibrate decreased osteonecrosis. To test whether fenofibrate affected the antileukemic efficacy of dexamethasone, we utilized a BCR-ABL+ model of ALL. Serum triglycerides were reduced with fenofibrate throughout treatment, with the most pronounced 4.5-fold decrease at week 3 (p<1x10-6). Both frequency (33% versus 74%, p=0.006) and severity (median necrosis score of 0 versus 75; p=6x10-5) of osteonecrosis were reduced with fenofibrate. Fenofibrate had no impact on BCR-ABL+ ALL survival (p=0.65) nor on the antileukemic properties of dexamethasone (p=0.49). These data suggest that lowering triglycerides with fenofibrate reduces dexamethasone-induced osteonecrosis while maintaining antileukemic efficacy, and thus may be considered for clinical trials.","['Finch, Emily R', 'Payton, Monique A', 'Jenkins, David A', 'Cai, Xiangjun', 'Li, Lie', 'Karol, Seth E', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Janke, Laura J']","['Finch ER', 'Payton MA', 'Jenkins DA', 'Cai X', 'Li L', 'Karol SE', 'Relling MV', 'Janke LJ']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Triglycerides)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'U202363UOS (Fenofibrate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dexamethasone', '*Fenofibrate', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Mice', '*Osteonecrosis/chemically induced/drug therapy', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Triglycerides']",,,2020/07/18 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2020/07/18 06:00'],"['2020/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2020.252767 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2020.252767 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Aug 1;106(8):2095-2101. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.252767.,,20210801,,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM115279/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA142665/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC8327737,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-one patients with an MPN (35 polycythemia vera (PV), 5 primary myelofibrosis, 1 essential thrombocythemia) and a CMML-like phenotype (MPN/CMML) were comprehensively characterized regarding clinical, hematologic, biologic and molecular features. The white blood cell counts in MPN/CMML patients were not different from CMML patients and PV patients. The hemoglobin values and platelet counts of these patients were higher than in CMML but lower than in PV, respectively. MPN/CMML patients showed myelomonocytic skewing, a typical in vitro feature of CMML but not of PV. The mutational landscape of MPN/CMML was not different from JAK2-mutated CMML. In two MPN/CMML patients, development of a CMML-like phenotype was associated with a decrease in the JAK2 V617F allelic burden. Finally, the prognosis of MPN/CMML (median overall survival (OS) 27 months) was more similar to CMML (JAK2-mutated, 28 months; JAK2-nonmutated 29 months) than to PV (186 months). In conclusion, we show that patients with MPN and a CMML-like phenotype share more characteristics with CMML than with PV, which may be relevant for their classification and clinical management.","['Heibl, Sonja', 'Gisslinger, Bettina', 'Jager, Eva', 'Barna, Agnes', 'Gurbisz, Michael', 'Stegemann, Maike', 'Bettelheim, Peter', 'Machherndl-Spandl, Sigrid', 'Pfeilstocker, Michael', 'Nosslinger, Thomas', 'Uyanik, Gokhan', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Stauder, Reinhard', 'Thaler, Josef', 'Kusec, Rajko', 'Valent, Peter', 'Gisslinger, Heinz', 'Geissler, Klaus']","['Heibl S', 'Gisslinger B', 'Jager E', 'Barna A', 'Gurbisz M', 'Stegemann M', 'Bettelheim P', 'Machherndl-Spandl S', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Nosslinger T', 'Uyanik G', 'Hoermann G', 'Stauder R', 'Thaler J', 'Kusec R', 'Valent P', 'Gisslinger H', 'Geissler K']","['Department of Internal Medicine IV, Hospital Wels-Grieskirchen, 4600 Wels, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Blood Transfusion Service, Blood Transfusion Service for Upper Austria, Austrian Red Cross, 4020 Linz, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V with Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Care, Hospital Hietzing, 1130 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I with Hematology with Stem Cell Transplantation, Hemostaseology and Medical Oncology, Ordensklinikum Linz Barmherzige Schwestern-Elisabethinen, 4020 Linz, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I with Hematology with Stem Cell Transplantation, Hemostaseology and Medical Oncology, Ordensklinikum Linz Barmherzige Schwestern-Elisabethinen, 4020 Linz, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hanusch Hospital, 1140 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Hanusch Hospital, 1140 Vienna, Austria.', 'Center for Medical Genetics, Hanusch Hospital, 1140 Vienna, Austria.', 'Medical School, Sigmund Freud University, 1020 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Central Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Internal Medicine V with Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine IV, Hospital Wels-Grieskirchen, 4600 Wels, Austria.', 'School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, University Hospital Dubrava, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology (LBI HO), Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Internal Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V with Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Care, Hospital Hietzing, 1130 Vienna, Austria.', 'Medical School, Sigmund Freud University, 1020 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['NGS', 'chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'progenitor cells', 'prognosis']",2020/07/18 06:00,2020/07/18 06:01,['2020/07/18 06:00'],"['2020/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/18 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12071891 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12071891 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jul 14;12(7). pii: cancers12071891. doi: 10.3390/cancers12071891.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8182-990X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8993-9561', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0456-5095']",20200714,,,"['ABCMML-112015/Gesellschaft zur Erforschung der Biologie und Therapie von', 'Tumorkrankheiten', 'F4704-B20/Austrian Science Fund (FWF)']",PMC7409251,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemical structures were confirmed by spectral data and elemental analyses. Nine compounds were selected and screened for their cytotoxic activity at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA against 60 cancer cell lines in a single dose assay. Compounds 4 and 5 exerted the most potent growth inhibitory activity against most cancer cell lines with growth inhibition (GI%) ranges from 44.86% to 84.59% and 31.20% to 52.36%, respectively. Consequently, they were further investigated through IC50 determination using five dose MTT colorimetric assay against three sensitive cell lines, leukemia CCRF-CEM, non-small cell lung cancer HOP-92 and liver cancer Hep-G2. Compound 4 exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against the three tested cell lines with IC50 16.34, 3.45 and 7.79 muM, respectively representing half potency, 3.5 folds potency and nearly equipotent to roscovitine. To investigate its mechanism of action, cell cycle analysis of compound 4 was conducted and showed that it induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis in HOP-92 cells. In correlation with the previous results, caspase-3 activation was tested and illustrated elevation in its concentration by nearly 14 folds than control. Besides, enzyme inhibition assay of compound 4 was evaluated towards two common antitumor targets namely KDM1 and CDK1 showing significant inhibitory activity with IC50 0.096 and 0.078 muM, respectively.","['Husseiny, Ebtehal M']",['Husseiny EM'],"['Department of Pharmaceutical Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy (Girls), Al-Azhar University, Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt.

Considering the frequency of cytokine release syndrome and CAR-T-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRS/CRES) after CAR-T administration, strategies enabling timely prediction of impending CRS/CRES are a clinical need. METHODS: We evaluated the dynamics of serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels and CAR-T transgene copy numbers by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction in the peripheral blood of 11 consecutive patients with aggressive B-cell malignancies. RESULTS: Four of 11 patients developed CRS, and 3 patients had CRES (33%), 2 of them had previous CRS. IL-6 levels increased on the day of clinical manifestation of CRS. All CRS patients had increased IL-6 peak levels (median IL-6 peak 606 pg/mL in CRS patients vs. 22 pg/mL in non-CRS patients, p=0.0061). Different patterns emerged from the dynamics of CAR-T/microg genomic DNA: ""rapid increase and rapid decrease with complete disappearance,"" ""rapid increase and slow decrease with higher persistence,"" ""rapid increase and rapid decrease with lower persistence,"" and ""slow increase and rapid decrease with almost disappearance."" Patients with the pattern ""rapid increase and slow decrease with higher persistence"" of CAR-T/microg genomic DNA concentration seemed to be at higher risk of developing CRS/CRES. CONCLUSION: Thus, the dynamics of CAR-T transgene copy numbers merits further evaluation for a possible association with manifestation of CRS. Increased IL-6 serum levels at CRS manifestation may contribute to the interpretation of symptoms.","['Pabst, Thomas', 'Joncourt, Raphael', 'Shumilov, Evgenii', 'Heini, Alexander', 'Wiedemann, Gertrud', 'Legros, Myriam', 'Seipel, Katja', 'Schild, Christof', 'Jalowiec, Katarzyna', 'Mansouri Taleghani, Behrouz', 'Fux, Michaela', 'Novak, Urban', 'Porret, Naomi', 'Zeerleder, Sacha', 'Bacher, Ulrike']","['Pabst T', 'Joncourt R', 'Shumilov E', 'Heini A', 'Wiedemann G', 'Legros M', 'Seipel K', 'Schild C', 'Jalowiec K', 'Mansouri Taleghani B', 'Fux M', 'Novak U', 'Porret N', 'Zeerleder S', 'Bacher U']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital Bern, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.

Somatic DNMT3A mutations arise in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) many years before malignancies develop, but difficulties in comparing their impact before malignancy with wild-type cells have limited the understanding of their contributions to transformation. To circumvent this limitation, we derived normal and DNMT3A mutant lymphoblastoid cell lines from a germline mosaic individual in whom these cells co-existed for nearly 6 decades. Mutant cells dominated the blood system, but not other tissues. Deep sequencing revealed similar mutational burdens and signatures in normal and mutant clones, while epigenetic profiling uncovered the focal erosion of DNA methylation at oncogenic regulatory regions in mutant clones. These regions overlapped with those sensitive to DNMT3A loss after DNMT3A ablation in HSCs and in leukemia samples. These results suggest that DNMT3A maintains a conserved DNA methylation pattern, the erosion of which provides a distinct competitive advantage to hematopoietic cells.","['Tovy, Ayala', 'Reyes, Jaime M', 'Gundry, Michael C', 'Brunetti, Lorenzo', 'Lee-Six, Henry', 'Petljak, Mia', 'Park, Hyun Jung', 'Guzman, Anna G', 'Rosas, Carina', 'Jeffries, Aaron R', 'Baple, Emma', 'Mill, Jonathan', 'Crosby, Andrew H', 'Sency, Valerie', 'Xin, Baozhong', 'Machado, Heather E', 'Castillo, Danielle', 'Weitzel, Jeffrey N', 'Li, Wei', 'Stratton, Michael R', 'Campbell, Peter J', 'Wang, Heng', 'Sanders, Mathijs A', 'Goodell, Margaret A']","['Tovy A', 'Reyes JM', 'Gundry MC', 'Brunetti L', 'Lee-Six H', 'Petljak M', 'Park HJ', 'Guzman AG', 'Rosas C', 'Jeffries AR', 'Baple E', 'Mill J', 'Crosby AH', 'Sency V', 'Xin B', 'Machado HE', 'Castillo D', 'Weitzel JN', 'Li W', 'Stratton MR', 'Campbell PJ', 'Wang H', 'Sanders MA', 'Goodell MA']","['Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Cancer, Ageing, and Somatic Mutation, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Cancer, Ageing, and Somatic Mutation, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Dan L.

We undertook an evaluation of the Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi ICU to analyze patient clinical-demographic characteristics, compare the performance of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), delta-SOFA at 48 hours and Mortality Prediction Model-III (MPM-III) mortality prediction systems, and identify factors associated with increased risk of mortality. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of adult patients admitted to the ICU between January 2015 and September 2017. SOFA and MPM-III scores were determined at admission and SOFA repeated at 48 hours. RESULTS: Approximately 33% of patients did not meet ICU admission criteria. Mortality among the population of critically ill patients in the ICU was 31.7%, most of whom were male (61.4%) with a median age of 53.4 years. High adjusted odds of mortality were found among critically ill patients with leukemia (aOR 6.32, p<0.01), tuberculosis (aOR 3.96, p<0.01), post-cardiac arrest (aOR 3.57, p<0.01), admissions from the step-down unit (aOR 3.13, p<0.001), acute kidney injury (aOR 2.97, p<0.001) and metastatic cancer (aOR 2.45, p = 0.04). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve of admission SOFA was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.73-0.81), MPM-III 0.74 (95% CI, 0.69-0.79), delta-SOFA 0.69 (95% CI, 0.63-0.75) and 48-hour SOFA 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79-0.87). The difference between SOFA at 48 hours and admission SOFA, MPM-III and delta-SOFA was statistically significant (chi2 = 17.1, 24.2 and 26.5 respectively; p<0.001). Admission SOFA, MPM-III and 48-hour SOFA were well calibrated (p >0.05) while delta-SOFA was borderline (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Mortality among the critically ill was higher than expected in this well-resourced ICU. 48-hour SOFA performed better than admission SOFA, MPM-III and delta-SOFA in our cohort. While a large proportion of patients did not meet admission criteria but were boarded in the ICU, critically ill patients stepped-up from the step-down unit were unlikely to survive. Patients admitted following a cardiac arrest, and those with advanced disease such as leukemia, stage-4 HIV and metastatic cancer, had particularly poor outcomes. Policies for fair allocation of beds, protocol-driven admission criteria and appropriate case selection could contribute to lowering the risk of mortality among the critically ill to a level on par with HICs.","['Lukoko, Lillian N', 'Kussin, Peter S', 'Adam, Rodney D', 'Orwa, James', 'Waweru-Siika, Wangari']","['Lukoko LN', 'Kussin PS', 'Adam RD', 'Orwa J', 'Waweru-Siika W']","['Department of Anesthesia, Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, United States of America.', 'Departments of Pathology and Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Department of Population Health, Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Department of Anesthesia, Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Critical Illness/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals, Private', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Kenya/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Organ Dysfunction Scores', 'ROC Curve', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers']",,,2020/07/17 06:00,2020/09/18 06:00,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0235809 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-20762 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Jul 16;15(7):e0235809. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0235809. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3045-3372'],20200716,,,,PMC7365402,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is currently unknown whether a maintenance therapy using FLT3 inhibitors, such as the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib, improves outcome after HCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase II trial (SORMAIN; German Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00000591), 83 adult patients with FLT3-ITD-positive AML in complete hematologic remission after HCT were randomly assigned to receive for 24 months either the multitargeted and FLT3-kinase inhibitor sorafenib (n = 43) or placebo (n = 40 placebo). Relapse-free survival (RFS) was the primary endpoint of this trial. Relapse was defined as relapse or death, whatever occurred first. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 41.8 months, the hazard ratio (HR) for relapse or death in the sorafenib group versus placebo group was 0.39 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.85; log-rank P = .013). The 24-month RFS probability was 53.3% (95% CI, 0.36 to 0.68) with placebo versus 85.0% (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.93) with sorafenib (HR, 0.256; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.65; log-rank P = .002). Exploratory data show that patients with undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) before HCT and those with detectable MRD after HCT derive the strongest benefit from sorafenib. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib maintenance therapy reduces the risk of relapse and death after HCT for FLT3-ITD-positive AML.","['Burchert, Andreas', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Fritz, Lea V', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Stelljes, Matthias', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Wollmer, Ellen', 'Wasch, Ralph', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Berg, Tobias', 'Lang, Fabian', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Zeiser, Robert', 'Wagner, Eva-Maria', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Wolschke, Christine', 'Schleuning, Michael', 'Gotze, Katharina S', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Crysandt, Martina', 'Esseling, Eva', 'Wolf, Dominik', 'Wang, Ying', 'Bohm, Alexandra', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Michel, Christian', 'Bethge, Wolfgang', 'Wundisch, Thomas', 'Brandts, Christian', 'Harnisch, Susanne', 'Wittenberg, Michael', 'Hoeffkes, Heinz-Gert', 'Rospleszcz, Susanne', 'Burchardt, Alexander', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Brugger, Markus', 'Strauch, Konstantin', 'Schade-Brittinger, Carmen', 'Metzelder, Stephan K']","['Burchert A', 'Bug G', 'Fritz LV', 'Finke J', 'Stelljes M', 'Rollig C', 'Wollmer E', 'Wasch R', 'Bornhauser M', 'Berg T', 'Lang F', 'Ehninger G', 'Serve H', 'Zeiser R', 'Wagner EM', 'Kroger N', 'Wolschke C', 'Schleuning M', 'Gotze KS', 'Schmid C', 'Crysandt M', 'Esseling E', 'Wolf D', 'Wang Y', 'Bohm A', 'Thiede C', 'Haferlach T', 'Michel C', 'Bethge W', 'Wundisch T', 'Brandts C', 'Harnisch S', 'Wittenberg M', 'Hoeffkes HG', 'Rospleszcz S', 'Burchardt A', 'Neubauer A', 'Brugger M', 'Strauch K', 'Schade-Brittinger C', 'Metzelder SK']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University Marburg and University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Campus Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology and Oncology, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University Marburg and University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Campus Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Freiburg University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Munster, Germany.', 'Medical Department I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University Marburg and University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Campus Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Freiburg University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Medical Department I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology and Oncology, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology and Oncology, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Medical Department I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology and Oncology, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Freiburg University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Medical Department III, Hematology, Medical Oncology and Pneumology, University Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'German Clinic for Diagnostics, Helios Clinic, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Hospital Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany;

Although remissions are durable, relapses remain a challenge. AREAS COVERED: Data from recent studies indicate that most patients relapsing on ibrutinib have mutations in BTK or PLCG2. The result of the C418S mutation in BTK is loss of covalent binding of ibrutinib to BTK resulting in reversible, transient inhibition in BTK mutant patients. There is downstream gain of function of BCR signaling with PLCG2 mutations allowing continued cell proliferation despite inhibition of BTK by ibrutinib. Agents targeting other pathways such as the BCL2 pathway, or agents binding to other BTK binding sites are promising therapies in patients with BTK-mutated resistance. Authors conducted a review of available literature on mechanism of ibrutinib resistance and management using PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov. EXPERT OPINION: The current approach is to offer a clinical trial or the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax to patients with ibrutinib-resistant CLL. We await more data from ongoing clinical trials combining different targeted therapies or using reversible BTK inhibitors will provide more options for overcoming ibrutinib resistance.","['Lama, Tsering Gyalpo', 'Kyung, Daniel', ""O'Brien, Susan""]","['Lama TG', 'Kyung D', ""O'Brien S""]","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, UI Health , Orange, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, UI Health , Orange, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, UI Health , Orange, CA, USA.', 'Associate Director for Clinical Sciences, Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, UCI Health , Orange Country, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Drug Development', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Retreatment', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR', '*BTK', '*CLL', '*Leukemia', '*chronic', '*ibrutinib', '*inhibitor', '*lymphocytic', '*mutation', '*resistance']",2020/07/17 06:00,2021/05/27 06:00,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2020.1797482 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2020 Aug;13(8):871-883. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2020.1797482.

There is little consensus regarding choice of optimal induction chemotherapy regimen for relapsed pediatric AML. PROCEDURE: A prospective single arm phase II study (CTRI/2017/02/007757) was carried out at our center to evaluate the safety and efficacy of outpatient cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide (ADE) regimen in pediatric AML (</=18 years) at the first relapse. Response evaluation was done by bone marrow aspiration morphology along with minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment. All adverse events including need and duration of hospitalization, transfusion support, and antimicrobial use were recorded. RESULTS: Total 45 patients were included with median age of 12 years. The CR rate of the cohort was 66% and 54% of patients were MRD negative. The estimated 2-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 29% (+/-7%) and 34% (+/-7%), respectively. The presence of fever at relapse was associated with inferior CR rate (P = .001), positive MRD (P = .01), and inferior EFS (P = .02), while not achieving nadir absolute neutrophil count of zero during induction was associated with inferior CR rate (P = .03) and inferior OS (P = .04). Approximately all patients developed >/=Grade 3 cytopenia and febrile neutropenia. Twenty-six (59%) patients required hospitalization for management of toxicity and there were four (9%) deaths attributed to infection. CONCLUSION: ADE is an effective induction regimen for pediatric AML patients at the first relapse with reasonable toxicity profile. Outpatient administration of the regimen is feasible in the presence of proper support structure and rigorous follow up.","['Garg, Arun', 'Ganguly, Shuvadeep', 'Vishnubhatla, Sreenivas', 'Chopra, Anita', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Garg A', 'Ganguly S', 'Vishnubhatla S', 'Chopra A', 'Bakhshi S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.R.A.

Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors represent a distinct and vulnerable group. This study aimed to explore how AYA survivors of childhood ALL experience everyday life after cancer while adjusting to the potential impact of prior disease and treatment. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were performed with survivors aged 15-22 years. Criterion-based homogenous purposive sampling was used to identify similarities within the group. Data were analyzed using an inductive, thematic approach. RESULTS: Data saturation occurred after 18 interviews. Identified themes included the post-chemo body, negotiating identities, and disruption. More than 80% reported physical or cognitive late effects, but survivors adapted to these and had a positive view on own health. However, a co-existing experience of frailty persisted. Social disruption during treatment had a negative impact on social relations even years following cure. Identity issues revolved around the paradox of seeking recognition for their cancer-related experiences, while also wanting to be treated like everyone else. Some participants aged 18-22 years experienced delayed reactions and a new, but unmet, need to process the past. CONCLUSIONS: AYA survivors of childhood ALL adapt well to their new life situations, but many experience ongoing cancer-related disruptions and experience not being fully understood. We suggest exploration and verbalization of these issues alongside somatic follow-up around the age of 16-18 years to support the AYA survivors during their transition into adulthood.","['Andres-Jensen, Liv', 'Larsen, Hanne Baekgaard', 'Johansen, Christoffer', 'Frandsen, Thomas Leth', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Wahlberg, Ayo']","['Andres-Jensen L', 'Larsen HB', 'Johansen C', 'Frandsen TL', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Wahlberg A']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Late Effects Research Unit CASTLE, Finsen Center, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Survivorship Research Unit, Danish Cancer Society Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Anthropology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Adolescent', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology/therapy', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*adolescent', '*cancer survivors', '*leukemia', '*long-term adverse effects', '*pediatrics', '*psycho-oncology', '*qualitative research', '*quality of life', '*survivorship', '*young adult']",2020/07/17 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2020/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.5480 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2020 Oct;29(10):1630-1637. doi: 10.1002/pon.5480.

METHOD: After in vitro testing and a phase I study (n = 20), 59 patients were randomized in the IM/HU and 29 in the IM arm. According to protocol, 49 propensity-score matched IM patients were included from the CML-IV study. RESULTS: Additive specific inhibition of CML cells by IM/HU was detected in vitro. HU 500 mg qd in combination with IM 400 mg qd proved feasible in the phase I study. Overall, no significant difference with respect to major molecular response (MMR) at 18 months (IM/HU and IM 66%; primary endpoint) was observed. Significant differences were noted for MMR at 6 months (p = 0.04) and for cumulative incidences of adverse events (p = 0.03) in favor of IM monotherapy (secondary endpoints). CONCLUSION: IM/HU combination was more potent in selectively inhibiting CML cells in vitro, but not superior to IM in vivo.

However, the involvement of TRIM24 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been well investigated. The present study aims to investigate the significance, cellular function, and potential regulatory mechanism of TRIM24 in AML. We found that TRIM24 expression was significantly upregulated in AML compared with normal tissues. AML patients with low expression of TRIM24 had higher survival rates than those expressing TRIM24 at higher levels. High expression of TRIM24 was also detected in AML cells and its knockdown markedly restricted proliferation and promoted apoptosis in AML cells. Further investigation revealed that TRIM24 contributed to the regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, which was associated with modulating the phosphorylation status of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). Inactivation of GSK-3beta partially reversed the TRIM24 knockdown-mediated antitumor effects observed in AML cells. Furthermore, knockdown of TRIM24 retarded the growth of AML-derived xenograft tumors in nude mice in vivo. Overall, these findings demonstrate that knockdown of TRIM24 impedes the AML tumor growth through the modulation of Wnt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling. These findings highlight the potential TRIM24 as an attractive anticancer target to treat AML.","['Li, C', 'Xin, H', 'Shi, Y', 'Mu, J']","['Li C', 'Xin H', 'Shi Y', 'Mu J']","[""Department of General Practice, 162798The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Cardiology, 162798The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Cardiology, 162798The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of General Practice, 162798The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Cardiology, 162798The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (TRIM24 protein, human)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Prognosis', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'TRIM24', 'Wnt', 'beta-catenin']",2020/07/17 06:00,2021/04/23 06:00,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0960327120938845 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 2020 Dec;39(12):1725-1736. doi: 10.1177/0960327120938845.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has traditionally been treated with multi-agent chemotherapy, but conventional therapies have not improved the long-term survival for decades. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is an indolent disease which requires lifelong treatment, is associated with significant side effects, and carries a risk of progression to potentially lethal blast crises. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances in molecular biology, virology, and immunology have enabled researchers to grow and modify T lymphocytes ex-vivo. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has been shown to specifically target cells of lymphoid lineage and induce remission in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. While the success of CAR T-cells against ALL is considered a defining moment in modern oncology, similar efficacy against myeloid leukemia cells remains elusive. Over the past 10 years, numerous CAR T-cells have been developed that can target novel myeloid antigens, and many clinical trials are finally starting to yield encouraging results. In this review, we present the recent advances in this field and discuss strategies for future development of myeloid targeting CAR T-cell therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The field of CAR T-cell therapy has rapidly evolved over the past few years. It represents a radically new approach towards cancers, and with continued refinement it may become a viable therapeutic option for patients of acute and chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Pratap, Suraj', 'Zhao, Zhizhuang J']","['Pratap S', 'Zhao ZJ']","['University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA.', 'University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Department of Pathology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Rep (Hoboken),"Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",101747728,"['0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",,"['Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/physiology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T-cells', '*CD123 CAR T-cells', '*CD33 CAR T-cells', '*acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*adoptive cell therapy', '*chimeric antigen receptor']",2020/07/17 06:00,2021/11/30 06:00,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cnr2.1222 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Rep (Hoboken). 2020 Apr;3(2):e1222. doi: 10.1002/cnr2.1222.

However, redirecting CAR T cells to malignant T cells is more challenging due to product-specific cis- and trans-activation causing fratricide. Other challenges include the potential for product contamination and T cell aplasia. We expressed non-signaling CARs (NSCARs) in gammadelta T cells since donor-derived gammadelta T cells can be used to prevent product contamination, and NSCARs lack signaling/activation domains, but retain antigen-specific tumor cell-targeting capability. As a result, NSCAR targeting requires an alternative cytotoxic mechanism, which can be achieved through utilization of gammadelta T cells that possess major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent cytotoxicity. We designed two distinct NSCARs and demonstrated that they do not enhance tumor-killing by alphabeta T cells, as predicted. However, both CD5-NSCAR- and CD19-NSCAR-modified gammadelta T cells enhanced cytotoxicity against T and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL and B-ALL) cell lines, respectively. CD5-NSCAR expression in gammadelta T cells resulted in a 60% increase in cytotoxicity of CD5-expressing T-ALL cell lines. CD19-NSCAR-modified gammadelta T cells exhibited a 350% increase in cytotoxicity against a CD19-expressing B-ALL cell line compared to the cytotoxicity of naive cells. NSCARs may provide a mechanism to enhance antigen-directed anti-tumor cytotoxicity of gammadelta T cells through the introduction of a high-affinity interaction while avoiding self-activation.","['Fleischer, Lauren C', 'Becker, Scott A', 'Ryan, Rebecca E', 'Fedanov, Andrew', 'Doering, Christopher B', 'Spencer, H Trent']","['Fleischer LC', 'Becker SA', 'Ryan RE', 'Fedanov A', 'Doering CB', 'Spencer HT']","['Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Program in Molecular and Systems Pharmacology, Graduate Division of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Laney Graduate School, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Program in Molecular and Systems Pharmacology, Graduate Division of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Laney Graduate School, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Program in Molecular and Systems Pharmacology, Graduate Division of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Laney Graduate School, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Program in Molecular and Systems Pharmacology, Graduate Division of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Laney Graduate School, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Program in Molecular and Systems Pharmacology, Graduate Division of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Laney Graduate School, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Ther Oncolytics,Molecular therapy oncolytics,101666776,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR', 'CD19 nonstimulating CAR', 'NSCAR', 'anti-CD5CAR', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'gamma delta T cells', 'non-stimulating chimeric antigen receptor']",2020/07/17 06:00,2020/07/17 06:01,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2020/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.omto.2020.06.003 [doi]', 'S2372-7705(20)30082-6 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Ther Oncolytics. 2020 Jun 4;18:149-160. doi: 10.1016/j.omto.2020.06.003. eCollection 2020 Sep 25.,,20200604,,['(c) 2020 The Author(s).'],['T32 GM008602/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7341062,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The discovery of imatinib represents a major success story in the treatment against CML. However, mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain are a major cause of resistance to imatinib, demonstrating that BCR-ABL remains a critical drug target. Here, we investigate a novel small molecule inhibitor, OGP46, for its inhibitory activity against K562, a panel of murine BaF3 cell lines stably expressing either wild-type BCR-ABL or its mutant forms, including T315I. OGP46 exhibits potent activity against imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutations, including T315I. OGP46 induced cell differentiation accompanied by G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest and suppressed the colony formation capacity of cells. Treatment with OGP46 significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression of BCR-ABL in K562 and BaF3-p210-T315I cells. Mechanistically, the anti-cancer activity of OGP46 induced by cell differentiation is likely through the BCR-ABL/JAK-STAT pathway in native BCR-ABL and mutant BCR-ABL, including T315I, of CML cells. Our findings highlight that OGP46 is active against not only native BCR-ABL but also 11 clinically relevant BCR-ABL mutations, including T315I mutation, which are resistant to imatinib. Thus, OGP46 may be a novel strategy for overcoming imatinib-resistance BCR-ABL mutations, including T315I.","['Wei, Liuya', 'Yang, Yang', 'Gupta, Pranav', 'Wang, Aihong', 'Zhao, Min', 'Zhao, Yao', 'Qu, Mei', 'Ke, Yu', 'Liu, Ying', 'Liu, Hong-Min', 'Xu, Xin', 'Sun, Yanli', 'Chen, Zhe-Sheng', 'Hu, Zhenbo']","['Wei L', 'Yang Y', 'Gupta P', 'Wang A', 'Zhao M', 'Zhao Y', 'Qu M', 'Ke Y', 'Liu Y', 'Liu HM', 'Xu X', 'Sun Y', 'Chen ZS', 'Hu Z']","['Laboratory for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang 261042, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Weifang Medical University, Weifang 261053, China.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA."", 'School of Pharmacy, Weifang Medical University, Weifang 261053, China.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA."", 'Laboratory for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang 261042, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Weifang Medical University, Weifang 261053, China.', 'Laboratory for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang 261042, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Weifang Medical University, Weifang 261053, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.', 'College of Bioscience and Technology, Weifang Medical University, Weifang 261053, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Weifang Medical University, Weifang 261053, China.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY 11439, USA."", 'Laboratory for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang 261042, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Ther Oncolytics,Molecular therapy oncolytics,101666776,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL kinase', 'BCR-ABL mutations', 'JAK-STAT pathway', 'T315I mutation', 'cell differentiation', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imatinib resistance', 'targeted therapies']",2020/07/17 06:00,2020/07/17 06:01,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2020/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.omto.2020.06.008 [doi]', 'S2372-7705(20)30087-5 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Ther Oncolytics. 2020 Jun 9;18:137-148. doi: 10.1016/j.omto.2020.06.008. eCollection 2020 Sep 25.,,20200609,,['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],,PMC7341061,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite significant efficacy in most CLL patients, some patients develop resistance to these agents and progress on these drugs. We provide a state-of-the-art overview of the acquired resistance to novel agents. In 80% of patients with ibrutinib failure, acquired mutations in BTK and PLCG2 genes were detected. No distinct unifying resistance-associated mutations or deregulated signaling pathways have been reported in idelalisib failure. Acquired mutations in the BCL2 gene were detected in patients who had failed on venetoclax. In most cases, patients who have progressed on ibrutinib and venetoclax experience resistance-associated mutations, often present at low allelic frequencies. Resistance-associated mutations tend to occur between the second and fourth years of treatment and may already be detected several months before clinical relapse. We also discuss the development of next-generation agents for CLL patients who have acquired resistant mutations to current inhibitors.","['Sedlarikova, Lenka', 'Petrackova, Anna', 'Papajik, Tomas', 'Turcsanyi, Peter', 'Kriegova, Eva']","['Sedlarikova L', 'Petrackova A', 'Papajik T', 'Turcsanyi P', 'Kriegova E']","['Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and University Hospital, Olomouc, Czechia.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and University Hospital, Olomouc, Czechia.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and University Hospital, Olomouc, Czechia.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and University Hospital, Olomouc, Czechia.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and University Hospital, Olomouc, Czechia.']",['eng'],['Systematic Review'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'genetic aberrations', 'resistance-associated mutations', 'targeted therapy', 'treatment resistance']",2020/07/17 06:00,2020/07/17 06:01,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2020/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00894 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jun 25;10:894. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00894. eCollection 2020.,,20200625,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Sedlarikova, Petrackova, Papajik, Turcsanyi and Kriegova.']",,PMC7330112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The commercial availability of the first two products has facilitated the development of real-world experience in treating relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphomas, shed light on anti-CD19 CAR T-cell products' feasibility in trial-ineligible patients, and raised the need for strategies to mitigate the adverse effects associated with anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, such as cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, and cytopenia. In addition, promising clinical data supporting the use of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in patients with indolent B-cell lymphomas or chronic lymphocytic leukemia have recently become available, breaking the paradigm that these conditions are not curable. Multiple clinical CAR T-cell therapy-based trials are ongoing.

Daunorubicin and cytarabine are first-line chemotherapy for AML, with bone marrow transplantation in most cases. Recently, cancer immunotherapy has been challenged in AML and leukemia-niche myeloid cells are promising targets for the AML immunotherapy. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) is an antioxidative and cytoprotective enzyme inducing chemo-resistant AML and has been focused as an immune checkpoint molecule in tumor microenvironments. Herein, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle (hNP) is loaded with tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP), a HO1-inhibitor, and non-covalently modified with an engineered antibody for leukemic cell-targeted delivery. HO1-inhibiting T-hNP (T-hNP/SnMP) enhances chemo-sensitivity in human leukemia cells. In a human AML-bearing orthotopic mouse model, intravenously injected T-hNP not only actively targets to human leukemia cells but passively targets to CD11b+ myeloid cells in a bone marrow niche. The T-hNP/SnMP enhances the chemo-therapeutic effect of daunorubicin and boosts immune response by reprogramming bone marrow myeloid cells resulting from the recruitment of the monocyte-lineage and induction of inflammatory genes. The ex vivo study demonstrates an enhanced immune response of HO1-inhibited bone marrow CD11b+ myeloid cells against apoptotic leukemia cells. Collectively, HO1-inhibiting dual cell-targeted T-hNP/SnMP has a strong potential as a novel therapeutic in AML.","['Yong, Seok-Beom', 'Kim, Jaehyun', 'Chung, Jee Young', 'Ra, Sehee', 'Kim, Seong Su', 'Kim, Yong-Hee']","['Yong SB', 'Kim J', 'Chung JY', 'Ra S', 'Kim SS', 'Kim YH']","['Department of Bioengineering Institute for Bioengineering and Biopharmaceutical Research BK 21 Plus Future Biopharmaceutical Human Resources Training and Research Team Hanyang University Seoul 133-791 Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bioengineering Institute for Bioengineering and Biopharmaceutical Research BK 21 Plus Future Biopharmaceutical Human Resources Training and Research Team Hanyang University Seoul 133-791 Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bioengineering Institute for Bioengineering and Biopharmaceutical Research BK 21 Plus Future Biopharmaceutical Human Resources Training and Research Team Hanyang University Seoul 133-791 Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bioengineering Institute for Bioengineering and Biopharmaceutical Research BK 21 Plus Future Biopharmaceutical Human Resources Training and Research Team Hanyang University Seoul 133-791 Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bioengineering Institute for Bioengineering and Biopharmaceutical Research BK 21 Plus Future Biopharmaceutical Human Resources Training and Research Team Hanyang University Seoul 133-791 Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Bioengineering Institute for Bioengineering and Biopharmaceutical Research BK 21 Plus Future Biopharmaceutical Human Resources Training and Research Team Hanyang University Seoul 133-791 Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Adv Sci (Weinh),"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",101664569,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myelogenous leukemia', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'heme oxygenase 1-targeted leukemia immunotherapy', 'heme oxygenase 1-targeted nanomedicine', 'immunotherapeutic nanomedicine']",2020/07/17 06:00,2020/07/17 06:01,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2020/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/advs.202000487 [doi]', 'ADVS1863 [pii]']",epublish,Adv Sci (Weinh). 2020 Jun 3;7(13):2000487. doi: 10.1002/advs.202000487. eCollection 2020 Jul.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3709-507X'],20200603,,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

We present the first case of female on sulfasalazine for psoriatic arthritis, otherwise healthy, who was diagnosed with NE involving the cecum and rectum. This adds up to the cases of NE diagnosed in nononcologic conditions. A 65-year-old female with a history of psoriatic arthritis on sulfasalazine, presented to the emergency department (ED) after an episode of syncope. She was complaining of a fever and mild generalized abdominal pain. Physical exam was remarkable for peri-umbilical tenderness. Severe neutropenia and acute kidney injury were found on blood work. CT scan of the abdomen showed evidence of colitis, involving the cecum, ascending colon and rectum, which in light of neutropenia was consistent with NE. Clostridium difficile colitis was ruled out. Intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated, and sulfasalazine was discontinued. The patient was subsequently afebrile and was out of neutropenia by day 3 without the need for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). By day 5, the patient was pain free and was discharged. Even though NE is primarily described in the setting of malignancies and chemotherapy, one should keep in mind that this entity can occur in people on any immunosuppressive therapy. Early discontinuation of sulfasalazine and conservative management were essential in the treatment of NE in this case. Whether neutropenia precipitates colitis or the latter causes agranulocytosis by bone marrow suppression through cytokines remains to be proved. The diagnosis of medication-related adverse reactions remains a big challenge for clinicians and therefore requires a high index of suspicion. Resolution of the symptoms can simply occur with the discontinuation of the offending drug and often does not require extensive workup or treatments that might cause harm to the patient's health.","['Homsy, Sylvester', 'Elfiky, Ahmed', 'Abureesh, Mohammad', 'Daneshvar, Danial', 'Bershadskiy, Alexander']","['Homsy S', 'Elfiky A', 'Abureesh M', 'Daneshvar D', 'Bershadskiy A']","['Internal Medicine, Staten Island University Hospital - Northwell Health, Staten Island, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Staten Island University Hospital - Northwell Health, Staten Island, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Staten Island University Hospital - Northwell Health, Staten Island, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Staten Island University Hospital - Northwell Health, Staten Island, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Staten Island University Hospital, Staten Island, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['neutropenia', 'neutropenic enterocolitis', 'psoriatic arthritis', 'sulfasalazine', 'typhlitis']",2020/07/17 06:00,2020/07/17 06:01,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.8576 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 Jun 12;12(6):e8576. doi: 10.7759/cureus.8576.,,20200612,,"['Copyright (c) 2020, Homsy et al.']",,PMC7358926,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NKp44 is only expressed by activated natural killer cells and detects a variety of transformed cells, while it reportedly does not react with normal tissues. The aim of this study is to develop CAR-T cell that can target multiple types of tumor cells. Methods: We created a series of novel CAR constructs in first-generation (1G) and second-generation (2G) CAR format with the extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain of NKp44 (NKp44-CAR). Results: Transduction of the best 1G construct into human primary T cells led to specific cytotoxic effects and cytokine secretion upon encountering multiple types of neoplastic cells including AML, T-ALL and childhood solid tumors. Replacement of the extracellular hinge domain of NKp44 with that of CD8alpha resulted in diminished CAR function. The 1G NKp44-CAR-T cells exhibited significantly better tumor control in long-term co-culture assays compared with activated NK cells, as well as with NK cells transduced with identical NKp44-CAR. T cells transduced with the best 2G-CAR construct with 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain proliferated at significantly higher levels upon single antigen exposure and showed significantly better tumor control compared with the 1G-CAR and 2G-CAR with CD28 co-stimulatory domain. Conclusions: NKp44-based CAR endows T cells with NK cell-like anti-tumor specificity. The CAR gene created in this study will be useful for the development of novel gene-modified T-cell immunotherapy.","['Kasahara, Yasushi', 'Shin, Chansu', 'Kubo, Nobuhiro', 'Mihara, Keichiro', 'Iwabuchi, Haruko', 'Takachi, Takayuki', 'Imamura, Masaru', 'Saitoh, Akihiko', 'Imai, Chihaya']","['Kasahara Y', 'Shin C', 'Kubo N', 'Mihara K', 'Iwabuchi H', 'Takachi T', 'Imamura M', 'Saitoh A', 'Imai C']","['Department of Pediatrics Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences Niigata Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences Niigata Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences Niigata Japan.', 'International Regenerative Medical Center Fujita Health University Aichi Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences Niigata Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences Niigata Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences Niigata Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences Niigata Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences Niigata Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Clin Transl Immunology,Clinical & translational immunology,101638268,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['NKp44', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'natural killer cell', 'paediatric solid tumors']",2020/07/17 06:00,2020/07/17 06:01,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/cti2.1147 [doi]', 'CTI21147 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Transl Immunology. 2020 Jul 8;9(7):e1147. doi: 10.1002/cti2.1147. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7435-3464'],20200708,,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Design: A total of 17 Centers, from 10 countries, following 9,499 patients with hemoglobinopathies, participated in the survey. Main outcome data: Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 were collected from medical records and summarized. Results: A total of 13 patients, 7 with TM, 3 with TI, and 3 with SCD, with confirmed COVID-19, were identified in 6 Centers from different countries. The overall mean age of patients was 33.7+/-12.3 years (range:13-66); 9/13 (69.2%) patients were females. Six patients had pneumonia, and 4 needed oxygen therapy. Increased C-reactive protein (6/10), high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 6/10), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; 6/10) were the most common laboratory findings. 6/10 patients had an exacerbation of anemia (2 with SCD). In the majority of patients, the course of COVID-19 was moderate (6/10) and severe in 3/10 patients. A 30-year-old female with TM, developed a critical SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by death in an Intensive Care Unit. In one Center (Oman), the majority of suspected cases were observed in patients with SCD between the age of 21 and 40 years. A rapid clinical improvement of tachypnea/dyspnea and oxygen saturation was observed, after red blood cell exchange transfusion, in a young girl with SCD and worsening of anemia (Hb level from 9.2 g/dl to 6.1g/dl). Conclusions: The data presented in this survey permit an early assessment of the clinical characteristics of COVID 19 in different countries. 70% of symptomatic patients with COVID- 19 required hospitalization. The presence of associated co-morbidities can aggravate the severity of COVID- 19, leading to a poorer prognosis irrespective of age.","['de Sanctis, Vincenzo', 'Canatan, Duran', 'Corrons, Joan Lluis Vives', 'Karimi, Mehran', 'Daar, Shahina', 'Kattamis, Christos', 'Soliman, Ashraf T', 'Wali, Yasser', 'Alkindi, Salam', 'Huseynov, Valeh', 'Nasibova, Afag', 'Tiryaki, Tarik Onur', 'Evim, Melike Sezgin', 'Gunes, Adalet Meral', 'Karakas, Zeynep', 'Christou, Soteroula', 'Campisi, Saveria', 'Zarei, Tahereh', 'Khater, Doaa', 'Oymak, Yesim', 'Kaleva, Valeriya', 'Stoyanova, Denka', 'Banchev, Atanas', 'Galati, Maria Concetta', 'Yassin, Mohamed A', 'Kakar, Shruti', 'Skafida, Myrto', 'Kilinc, Yurdanur', 'Alyaarubi, Saif', 'Verdiyevas, Narmin', 'Stoeva, Iva', 'Raiola, Giuseppe', 'Mariannis, Demetris', 'Ruggiero, Leopoldo', 'Di Maio, Salvatore']","['de Sanctis V', 'Canatan D', 'Corrons JLV', 'Karimi M', 'Daar S', 'Kattamis C', 'Soliman AT', 'Wali Y', 'Alkindi S', 'Huseynov V', 'Nasibova A', 'Tiryaki TO', 'Evim MS', 'Gunes AM', 'Karakas Z', 'Christou S', 'Campisi S', 'Zarei T', 'Khater D', 'Oymak Y', 'Kaleva V', 'Stoyanova D', 'Banchev A', 'Galati MC', 'Yassin MA', 'Kakar S', 'Skafida M', 'Kilinc Y', 'Alyaarubi S', 'Verdiyevas N', 'Stoeva I', 'Raiola G', 'Mariannis D', 'Ruggiero L', 'Di Maio S']","['Pediatric and Adolescent Outpatient Clinic, Quisisana Hospital, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Antalya Genetic Diseases Diagnostic Center, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Red Blood Cell, and Haematopoietic Disorders Unit, Institute for Leukaemia Research Josep Carreras (IJC) and University of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.

Yet, about 200 cases were reported. However, dicentric dic(9;20) is a subtle abnormality which easily may be mixed up with monosomy 20 and/or del(9p). The dicentric dic(9;20) can be found as a sole chromosomal abnormality or can be masked within complex rearrangements; also, a dicentric dic(9;20) is often associated with mono- or biallelic loss of CDKN2A gene. Case presentation: Here we report a case of 16-year-old male diagnosed with a de novo pre-B-ALL. Molecular approaches (array-based multicolor banding (aMCB) and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)) were applied, and a unique complex karyotype involving six chromosomes was identified. It included three previously unreported chromosomal aberrations: dicentric dic(9;20;X), deletion del(7)(p22.2p15.2) and dicentric dic(7;13). The dicentric dic(9;20;X) also led to monoallelic loss of tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A. After successful chemotherapeutic treatment the patient experienced a relapse with a secondary ALL without complex karyotype but a deletion del(19)(p13). Unfortunately, the patient died after 17 months of the initial diagnosis. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, a comparable childhood ALL associated with such complex karyotype and deletion del(19)(p13) in secondary ALL was not previously reported. Thus, the complex karyotype with dicentrc dic(9;20;X) seems to indicate for a poor prognosis.","['Wafa, Abdulsamad', 'Jarjour, Rami A', 'Aljapawe, Abdulmunim', 'ALmedania, Suher', 'Liehr, Thomas', 'Melo, Joana B', 'Carreira, Isabel M', 'Othman, Moneeb A K', 'Al-Achkar, Walid']","['Wafa A', 'Jarjour RA', 'Aljapawe A', 'ALmedania S', 'Liehr T', 'Melo JB', 'Carreira IM', 'Othman MAK', 'Al-Achkar W']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Human Genetics Division, Atomic Energy Commission, Damascus, Syria.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Human Genetics Division, Atomic Energy Commission, Damascus, Syria.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Mammalians Biology Division, Atomic Energy Commission, Damascus, Syria.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Human Genetics Division, Atomic Energy Commission, Damascus, Syria.', 'Jena University Hospital, Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany.grid.275559.90000 0000 8517 6224', 'Cytogenetics and Genomics Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.grid.8051.c0000 0000 9511 4342', 'CIMAGO-Center of Investigation On Environment Genetics and Oncobiology-Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.grid.8051.c0000 0000 9511 4342', 'Cytogenetics and Genomics Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.grid.8051.c0000 0000 9511 4342', 'CIMAGO-Center of Investigation On Environment Genetics and Oncobiology-Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.grid.8051.c0000 0000 9511 4342', 'Jena University Hospital, Institute of Human Genetics, Jena, Germany.grid.275559.90000 0000 8517 6224', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Human Genetics Division, Atomic Energy Commission, Damascus, Syria.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)', 'Array-based multicolor banding (aMCB)', 'Complex karyotype', 'Dicentric dic(9;20)', 'Prognostic factors']",2020/07/17 06:00,2020/07/17 06:01,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2020/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-020-00499-x [doi]', '499 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2020 Jul 10;13:29. doi: 10.1186/s13039-020-00499-x. eCollection 2020.,,20200710,,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,PMC7350665,,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, affected patients are often immunosuppressed and at increased risk of infection and secondary malignancy. Previous meta-analysis has found that patients with cll have a risk of melanoma that is increased by a factor of 4 compared with the general population. Recent advances in the understanding of the PD receptor pathway have led to immunotherapies that target cancer cells. The use of PD-1 inhibitors is now considered first-line treatment for BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma. Interestingly, early preclinical data suggest that inhibition of that pathway could also be used in the treatment of cll; however, recent clinical data did not support the effectiveness of that approach. In this case series, we highlight 2 cases in which patients with cll and concurrent malignant melanoma underwent treatment with PD-1 inhibitors and were found to experience reductions in their white blood cell counts without improvement in their hemoglobin. Those cases further illustrate that treatment of cll with PD-1 inhibitors is ineffective.","['Landego, I', 'Hewitt, D', 'Hibbert, I', 'Dhaliwal, D', 'Pieterse, W', 'Grenier, D', 'Wong, R', 'Johnston, J', 'Banerji, V']","['Landego I', 'Hewitt D', 'Hibbert I', 'Dhaliwal D', 'Pieterse W', 'Grenier D', 'Wong R', 'Johnston J', 'Banerji V']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Rady College of Medicine, Max Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba and the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB.', 'Department of Nursing, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB.', 'Section of Hematology and Oncology, Rady College of Medicine, Max Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB.', 'Russell Health Centre, Community Oncology Program, Winnipeg, MB.', 'Section of Hematology and Oncology, Rady College of Medicine, Max Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB.', 'Section of Hematology and Oncology, Rady College of Medicine, Max Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba and the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB.', 'Section of Hematology and Oncology, Rady College of Medicine, Max Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba and the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB.', 'Section of Hematology and Oncology, Rady College of Medicine, Max Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Curr Oncol,"Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",9502503,['0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)'],IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*antagonists & inhibitors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Immunotherapy', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*cll', '*melanoma']",2020/07/17 06:00,2021/06/05 06:00,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3747/co.27.5371 [doi]', 'conc-27-169 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Oncol. 2020 Jun;27(3):169-172. doi: 10.3747/co.27.5371.

The present study aimed to examine the anti-tumor effects of honokiol in pancreatic cancer and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Materials and Methods: In vitro functional assays determined pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion. Xenograft nude mice model determined the in vivo anti-cancer effects of honokiol. Luciferase reporter assay determined the interaction between miR101 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). Results: Honokiol concentration-dependently suppressed pancreatic cancer cell viability. In addition, honokiol increased the caspase-3 activity and cell apoptotic rates, induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, and inhibited cell invasion in pancreatic cancer. Interestingly, honokiol treatment induced up-regulation of miR-101 in pancreatic cancer cells. Knockdown of miR-101 attenuated the honokiol-induced cell apoptosis and inhibition in cell invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. On the other hand, miR-101 overexpression induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell viability and invasion in pancreatic cancer. Further mechanistic study verified that Mcl-1 was negatively regulated by miR-101, and Mcl-1 overexpression counteracted the tumor-suppressive effects of honokiol on the pancreatic cancer cells. In vivo studies showed that honokiol dose-dependently suppressed tumor growth of pancreatic cancer in the nude mice and up-regulated miR-101 expression but down-regulated Mcl-1 expression in tumor tissues.

Rapid and early estimation of injuries to sensitive organs using markers of radiation response is critical for identifying individuals who could potentially exhibit ARS; however, there are currently no biodosimetry assays approved for human use. We developed a sensitive microRNA (miRNA)-based blood test for radiation dose reconstruction with +/-0.5 Gy resolution at critical dose range. Radiation dose-dependent changes in miR-150-5p in blood were internally normalized by a miRNA, miR-23a-3p, that was nonresponsive to radiation. miR-23a-3p was not highly expressed in blood cells but was abundant in circulation and was released primarily from the lung. Our assay showed the capability for dose estimation within hours to 1 week after exposure using a drop of blood from mice. We tested this biodosimetry assay for estimation of absorbed ionizing radiation dose in mice of varying ages and after exposure to both improvised nuclear device (IND)-spectrum neutrons and gamma rays. Leukemia specimens from patients exposed to fractionated radiation showed depletion of miR-150-5p in blood. We bridged the exposure of these patients to fractionated radiation by comparing responses after fractionated versus single acute exposure in mice. Although validation in nonhuman primates is needed, this proof-of-concept study suggests the potential utility of this assay in radiation disaster management and clinical applications.","['Yadav, Marshleen', 'Bhayana, Sagar', 'Liu, Joseph', 'Lu, Lanchun', 'Huang, Jason', 'Ma, Ya', 'Qamri, Zahida', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Jacob, Diviya S', 'Parasa, Shashaank T', 'Bhuiya, Noureen', 'Fadda, Paolo', 'Xu-Welliver, Meng', 'Chakravarti, Arnab', 'Jacob, Naduparambil K']","['Yadav M', 'Bhayana S', 'Liu J', 'Lu L', 'Huang J', 'Ma Y', 'Qamri Z', 'Mo X', 'Jacob DS', 'Parasa ST', 'Bhuiya N', 'Fadda P', 'Xu-Welliver M', 'Chakravarti A', 'Jacob NK']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. naduparambil.jacob@osumc.edu.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomarkers', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation, Ionizing']",,,2020/07/17 06:00,2021/06/24 06:00,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['12/552/eaaw5831 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.aaw5831 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2020 Jul 15;12(552). pii: 12/552/eaaw5831. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaw5831.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4778-8347', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6050-3596', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2932-0852', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4843-4759', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4841-8337', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9797-2687', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8708-6553', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9444-1461', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8747-692X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4056-2863']",,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

PRMT5 is overexpressed in primary MPN cells, and PRMT5 inhibition potently reduced MPN cell proliferation ex vivo. PRMT5 inhibition was efficacious at reversing elevated hematocrit, leukocytosis, and splenomegaly in a model of JAK2(V617F+) polycythemia vera and leukocyte and platelet counts, hepatosplenomegaly, and fibrosis in the MPL(W515L) model of myelofibrosis. Dual targeting of JAK and PRMT5 was superior to JAK or PRMT5 inhibitor monotherapy, further decreasing elevated counts and extramedullary hematopoiesis in vivo. PRMT5 inhibition reduced expression of E2F targets and altered the methylation status of E2F1 leading to attenuated DNA damage repair, cell-cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis. Our data link PRMT5 to E2F1 regulatory function and MPN cell survival and provide a strong mechanistic rationale for clinical trials of PRMT5 inhibitors in MPN. SIGNIFICANCE: Expression of PRMT5 and E2F targets is increased in JAK2(V617F+) MPN. Pharmacologic inhibition of PRMT5 alters the methylation status of E2F1 and shows efficacy in JAK2(V617F)/MPL(W515L) MPN models and primary samples. PRMT5 represents a potential novel therapeutic target for MPN, which is now being clinically evaluated.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1611.","['Pastore, Friederike',

For over 3 decades, various formulations of interferon (IFN) have been used for the treatment of MF, with variable results, and the role of IFN in the treatment of MF is evolving. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, Medline and Embase via Ovid, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science were searched from inception through March 2019 for studies of pegylated IFN (peg-IFN) and non-peg-IFN in MF patients. The primary outcome of overall response rate was defined as a composite of complete response, partial response, complete hematologic response, and partial hematologic response. Random-effects models were used to pool overall response rate, and metaregression analyses were performed to compare peg-IFN and non--peg-IFN formulations. RESULTS: Among the 10 studies with 141 MF patients included, the overall response rate was 49.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.4-69.3), and there was no statistically significant difference (P = .99) between peg-IFN (50.0%; 95% CI, 26.2-73.9; I(2) = 76.9%) and non-peg-IFN (49.6%; 95% CI, 20.5-79.0; I(2) = 56.7%). Treatment discontinuation resulting from adverse events was common with non-peg-IFN at 35.8% (95% CI, 3.5-68.1) per year, and less in the one study on peg-IFN (0.5% per year). CONCLUSION: IFN can lead to hematologic improvements in a subset of MF patients, but study quality is limited and heterogenous. Biomarkers predicting response to IFN and formulations with improved tolerability are needed.","['Bewersdorf, Jan Philipp', 'Giri, Smith', 'Wang, Rong', 'Podoltsev, Nikolai', 'Williams, Robert T', 'Rampal, Raajit K', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Zeidan, Amer M', 'Stahl, Maximilian']","['Bewersdorf JP', 'Giri S', 'Wang R', 'Podoltsev N', 'Williams RT', 'Rampal RK', 'Tallman MS', 'Zeidan AM', 'Stahl M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Alabama School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT; Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Yale University, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT; Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT.', 'Laboratory of Metabolic Regulation and Genetics, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT; Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed from the chart review data of children who were newly diagnosed with CBF-AML in the Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, from August 2009 to November 2015. According to the type of fusion gene, the children were divided into CBFB-MYH11 and AML1-ETO groups. Clinical features and prognosis were analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 91 children with CBF-AML were enrolled in this study, among whom there were 74 (81%) in the AML1-ETO group and 17 (19%) in the CBFB-MYH11 group. Additional chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 38 children (42%), and deletion of sex chromosome was the most common abnormality and was observed in 28 children (31%). After the first course of induction treatment, the complete remission rate was 97% (88/91), the recurrence rate was 29% (26/91), the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 65%+/-6%, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 75%+/-5%. There were no significant differences between the AML1-ETO and CBFB-MYH11 groups in 5-year EFS rate (62%+/-7% vs 77%+/-11%, P>0.05) or 5-year OS rate (72%+/-6% vs 88%+/-9%, P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: AML1-ETO is the main type of fusion gene in children with CBF-AML, and deletion of sex chromosome is the most common type of additional chromosomal abnormalities. Children with CBF-AML often have a good prognosis, and the children with AML1-ETO have a similar prognosis to those with CBFB-MYH11.","['Liu, Chao', 'Chen, Xiao-Yan', 'Yi, Mei-Hui', 'Wu, Wen-Qi', 'Ruan, Min', 'Zhu, Xiao-Fan']","['Liu C', 'Chen XY', 'Yi MH', 'Wu WQ', 'Ruan M', 'Zhu XF']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China. xfzhu@ihcams.ac.cn.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factors', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Prognosis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2020/07/17 06:00,2020/07/21 06:00,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2002039 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2020 Jul;22(7):739-743.,,,,,,PMC7389621,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bone marrow samples were collected from 5 children with AML who were diagnosed from May 2016 to June 2018. Normal bone marrow samples based on bone marrow examination were collected from 3 children as controls. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the expression of linc00467 in the two groups. A lentivirus system was used to achieve overexpression of linc00467 in AML cells (HL-60) (linc00467 overexpression group), and empty vector expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) was transfected into AML cells to establish a GFP control group. A lentivirus system was used to insert an interfering sequence into AML cells (sh-linc00467 interfering group), and a random sequence was inserted to establish an sh-NC control group. Cell proliferation and resistance to doxorubicin were observed for all groups. RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, the children with AML had a significant increase in linc00467 (P=0.018). Overexpression and interference with linc00467 expression had no significant effect on cell proliferation. Compared with the GFP control group, the linc00467 overexpression group had a significant increase in the viability of HL-60 cells at the adriamycin concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mug/mL (P<0.05). Compared with the sh-NC control group, the sh-linc00467 interfering group had a significant reduction in the viability of HL-60 cells at the adriamycin concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mug/mL (P<0.05). Compared with the untreated group, the adriamycin treatment group had a significant increase in the expression of linc00467 in HL-60 cells (P<0.05).

Meanwhile, benzene is a human carcinogen leading to leukemia. Although the links between benzene and various types of genetic damage indicators have been evaluated in several studies, but their results remain inconsistent. So we conducted a meta-analysis, and to explore the influence of low concentration benzene exposure on workers' genetic damage indicators using 3.25 mg/m(3) as the boundary value, in order to provide a basis for improved prevention and control of the harm from benzene exposure to the occupational population. METHODS: We conducted a search of five databases, including Pub Med, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang Data and Chongqing VIP, to identify relevant articles up to December 25, 2018. Two researchers independently extracted and evaluated the data according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the literature. The imported articles were managed by Endnote X7, and the data were extracted and sorted by Excel 2013. We utilized Stata 12.0 software to perform the meta-analysis in the present study. RESULTS: A total of 68 eligible articles were finally included for the synthetic analyses. The meta-analysis results showed that occupational benzene exposure led to significantly increased Micronucleus (MN) frequency, Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) frequency, Chromosome aberration (CA) frequency, Olive Tail moment (OTM), Tail moment (TM), Tail length (TL), and Tail DNA% (T DNA%) compared to the control group (P < 0.05), and the pooled effect value estimates were 1.36, 0.98, 0.76, 1.06, 0.96, 1.78, and 1.42, respectively. Subsequent analysis of the effect of low concentration benzene exposure on genetic damage found significantly increased MN frequency increased compared with the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Occupational benzene exposure can affect multiple genetic damage indicators. Even at an exposure concentration lower than 3.25 mg/m(3), benzene exposure has genotoxicity. These data provide an important scientific basis for the further revision of occupational disease prevention strategies. At the same time, increased attention should be focused on the health monitoring of the occupational population exposed to benzene, and health management should be strengthened to improve the health of the occupational population.","['Zhou, Yanhua', 'Wang, Kun', 'Wang, Boshen', 'Pu, Yuepu', 'Zhang, Juan']","['Zhou Y', 'Wang K', 'Wang B', 'Pu Y', 'Zhang J']","[""Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China. 101011288@seu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",England,BMC Public Health,BMC public health,100968562,"['0 (Carcinogens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Aberrations/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Recombination, Genetic/drug effects', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Benzene', 'Genetic damage', 'Meta-analysis']",2020/07/17 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12889-020-09215-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12889-020-09215-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Public Health. 2020 Jul 15;20(1):1113. doi: 10.1186/s12889-020-09215-1.,,20200715,,,"['81573120/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81730087/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81872645/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",PMC7362416,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor cells with drug resistance often cause recurrence and metastasis in cancer patients. Luteolin is a natural compound found from various types of vegetables and exhibit anticancer activity in different cancers. This study demonstrated that luteolin inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis of tamoxifen-resistant ER-positive breast cancer cells. Luteolin also causes cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and decreases mitochondrial membrane potential. Besides, luteolin reduces the levels of activated PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. The combination treatment of luteolin and PI3K, AKT, or mTOR inhibitors synergistically increases apoptosis in tamoxifen-resistant ER-positive breast cancer cells. Ras gene family (K-Ras, H-Ras, and N-Ras), an activator of PI3K, was transcriptionally repressed by luteolin via induction of tumor suppressor mixed-lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3) expression. MLL3 increases the level of monomethylation of Histone 3 Lysine 4 on the enhancer and promoter region of Ras genes, thus causes repression of Ras expressions.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that KMT2D pathogenic loss-of-function variants, which causes the Kabuki syndrome type 1, could affect the mitochondrial metabolic profile. By using Seahorse technology, we showed a significant reduction of the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate as well as a reduction of the glycolytic flux in both Kmt2d knockout MEFs and skin fibroblasts of Kabuki patients harboring heterozygous KMT2D pathogenic variants. Mass-spectrometry analysis of intermediate metabolites confirmed alterations in the glycolytic and TCA cycle pathways. The observed metabolic phenotype was accompanied by a significant increase in the production of reactive oxygen species. Measurements of the specific activities of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes revealed significant inhibition of CI (NADH dehydrogenase) and CIV (cytochrome c oxidase); this result was further supported by a decrease in the protein content of both complexes. Finally, we unveiled an impaired oxidation of glucose and larger reliance on long-chain fatty acids oxidation. Altogether, our findings clearly indicate a rewiring of the mitochondrial metabolic phenotype in the KMT2D-null or loss-of-function context that might contribute to the development of Kabuki disease, and represents metabolic reprogramming as a potential new therapeutic approach.","['Pacelli, Consiglia', 'Adipietro, Iolanda', 'Malerba, Natascia', 'Squeo, Gabriella Maria', 'Piccoli, Claudia', 'Amoresano, Angela', 'Pinto, Gabriella', 'Pucci, Pietro', 'Lee, Ji-Eun', 'Ge, Kai', 'Capitanio, Nazzareno', 'Merla, Giuseppe']","['Pacelli C', 'Adipietro I', 'Malerba N', 'Squeo GM', 'Piccoli C', 'Amoresano A', 'Pinto G', 'Pucci P', 'Lee JE', 'Ge K', 'Capitanio N', 'Merla G']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Foggia, 71121 Foggia, Italy.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, 71013 San Giovanni Rotondo (FG), Italy.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, 71013 San Giovanni Rotondo (FG), Italy.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, 71013 San Giovanni Rotondo (FG), Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Foggia, 71121 Foggia, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples ""Federico II"", 80126 Napoli, Italy.', 'INBB-Biostructures and Biosystems National Institute, 00136 Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples ""Federico II"", 80126 Napoli, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Naples ""Federico II"", 80126 Napoli, Italy.', 'CEINGE Advanced Biotechnology, Department of Chemical Sciences, Federico II University, 80145 Napoli, Italy.', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Foggia, 71121 Foggia, Italy.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, 71013 San Giovanni Rotondo (FG), Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Electron Transport Chain Complex Proteins)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2b protein, mouse)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Respiration/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Electron Transport Chain Complex Proteins/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glycolysis/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Loss of Function Mutation/*genetics', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Metabolic Flux Analysis', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",['NOTNLM'],"['*KMT2D', '*Kabuki syndrome', '*mitochondria']",2020/07/17 06:00,2021/03/05 06:00,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2020/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9071685 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9071685 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Jul 13;9(7). pii: cells9071685. doi: 10.3390/cells9071685.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4915-5823', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5078-928X']",20200713,,,,PMC7407568,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Predicting individual patient responses to defined drugs prior to application would help therapy stratification and could improve survival. With the purpose to aid personalized targeted treatment approaches, we developed a human-zebrafish xenograft (ALL-ZeFiX) assay to predict drug response in a patient in 5 days. Leukemia blast cells were pericardially engrafted into transiently immunosuppressed Danio rerio embryos, and engrafted embryos treated for the test case, venetoclax, before single-cell dissolution for quantitative whole blast cell analysis. Bone marrow blasts from patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed BCP-ALL were successfully expanded in 60% of transplants in immunosuppressed zebrafish embryos. The response of BCP-ALL cell lines to venetoclax in ALL-ZeFiX assays mirrored responses in 2D cultures. Venetoclax produced varied responses in patient-derived BCP-ALL grafts, including two results mirroring treatment responses in two refractory BCP-ALL patients treated with venetoclax. Here we demonstrate proof-of-concept for our 5-day ALL-ZeFiX assay with primary patient blasts and the test case, venetoclax, which after expanded testing for further targeted drugs could support personalized treatment decisions within the clinical time window for decision-making.","['Gauert, Anton', 'Olk, Nadine', 'Pimentel-Gutierrez, Helia', 'Astrahantseff, Kathy', 'Jensen, Lasse D', 'Cao, Yihai', 'Eggert, Angelika', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Hagemann, Anja I H']","['Gauert A', 'Olk N', 'Pimentel-Gutierrez H', 'Astrahantseff K', 'Jensen LD', 'Cao Y', 'Eggert A', 'Eckert C', 'Hagemann AIH']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK)-German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Health, Medical and Caring Sciences, Linkoping University, 58183 Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, 17165 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK)-German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK)-German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, 13353 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCP-ALL', 'patient-derived xenograft', 'pediatric cancer', 'personalized therapy', 'zebrafish']",2020/07/17 06:00,2020/07/17 06:01,['2020/07/17 06:00'],"['2020/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12071883 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12071883 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jul 13;12(7). pii: cancers12071883. doi: 10.3390/cancers12071883.,,20200713,,,"['HEFF201633KK/Berliner Krebsgesellschaft', 'R03/2016/Deutsche Jose Carreras Leukamie Stiftung']",PMC7408814,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: The aim of this study isto describe the tolerance and efficacy of compassionate use of ponatinib in a paediatric cohort of patients with Ph+ leukaemias. METHODS: Data from 11 children with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) registered to the international registry of childhood chronic myeloid leukaemia and from 3 children with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ ALL) treated with ponatinib were collected retrospectively. RESULTS: In 11 girls and 3 boys (median age 14 years), ponatinib was used as a second- to eighth-line treatment. Ponatinib was administered as single therapy (9 patients) or in combination with chemotherapy (8 patients). The status of the disease when ponatinib was started was as follows: CML in advanced phases (n = 8), CML in chronic phase without achievement of molecular response (n = 2) or presence of T315I mutation (n = 1) and Ph + ALL in molecular (n = 1) or marrow (n = 2) relapses. The median dose administered was 21.4 mg/m(2) and median duration of ponatinib was 2.5 months. Ponatinib alone or in combination with chemotherapy administered on 16 occasions led to achievement of major molecular response in 50% of cases. Ponatinib was used as a bridge to transplant in 4 cases. Among the 9 patients treated with ponatinib alone, toxicity grade III-IV (2 patients) was exclusively haematologic. No vascular events related to ponatinib were observed. CONCLUSION: Ponatinib may be a reasonable additional treatment option for children with Ph+ leukaemias who have failed several lines of therapy.","['Millot, Frederic', 'Suttorp, Meinolf', 'Versluys, Anne B', 'Kalwak, Krzysztof', 'Nelken, Brigitte', 'Ducassou, Stephane', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Baruchel, Andre']","['Millot F', 'Suttorp M', 'Versluys AB', 'Kalwak K', 'Nelken B', 'Ducassou S', 'Bertrand Y', 'Baruchel A']","['Inserm CIC 1402, University Hospital, Poitiers, France.

In this work, we analyzed integrin expression and adhesivity to fibronectin in primary cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Surface expression of integrins beta1 and alphaVbeta3 on primary leukemia cells (N = 46) was correlated with the stem cell marker CD34, as well as with cell adhesivity to fibronectin. The results were analyzed with regard to the mutational status of NPM1 and FLT3 genes. RESULTS: The integrin beta1 was omnipresent, whereas alphaVbeta3 was often more expressed on CD34-positive cells. In particular, higher alphaVbeta3 expression on CD34+ cells was associated with NPM1 mutation (P = .0018). Monocytic leukemias had significantly higher alphaVbeta3 expression compared to less maturated cases (P = .0008). Cells from patients with internal tandem duplications in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) had lower adhesivity to fibronectin compared to cells with wild-type FLT3 (P = .031), specifically in less differentiated myeloblasts. Inhibition of a putative FLT3-ITD target, EZH2, increased cell adhesivity in MV4-11 cell line (P = .024). CONCLUSIONS: The integrin alphaVbeta3 is expressed in particular on CD34+ cells with NPM1 mutation and might have a prognostic value in patients with mutated NPM1. FLT3-ITD is associated with lower cell adhesivity, especially in patients with less differentiated leukemias.","['Kuzelova, Katerina', 'Obr, Adam', 'Markova, Jana', 'Gasova, Zdenka']","['Kuzelova K', 'Obr A', 'Markova J', 'Gasova Z']","['Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Proteomics, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Clinical Department, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Apheresis, Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague 2, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Binding', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CD34', 'FLT3-ITD', 'Fms-like tyrosine kinase', 'integrin']",2020/07/16 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13488 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 Nov;105(5):578-587. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13488.

We performed an umbrella review to clarify and determine the associations between tea consumption and various types of cancer by summarizing and recalculating the existing meta-analyses. Meta-analyses of observational studies reporting associations between tea consumption and cancer risk were searched on PubMed and Embase. Associations found to be statistically significant were further classified into levels of evidence (convincing, suggestive, or weak), based on P value, between-study heterogeneity, prediction intervals, and small study effects. Sixty-four observational studies (case-control or cohort) corresponding to 154 effect sizes on the incidence of 25 types of cancer were included. Forty-three (27.9%) results in 15 different types of cancer were statistically significant. When combining all studies on the same type of cancer, 19 results in 11 different types of cancer showed significant associations with lower risk of gastrointestinal tract organ cancer (oral, gastric, colorectal, biliary tract, and liver cancer), breast cancer, and gynecological cancer (endometrial and ovarian cancer) as well as leukemia, lung cancer, and thyroid cancer. Only the reduced risk of oral cancer in tea-consuming populations (OR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.72; P value < 10-6) was supported by convincing evidence. Suggestive evidence was found for 6 results on biliary tract, breast, endometrial, liver, and oral cancer. To summarize, tea consumption was shown to have protective effects on some types of cancer, particularly oral cancer. More well-designed prospective studies are needed with consideration of other factors that can cause biases.","['Kim, Tai Lim', 'Jeong, Gwang Hun', 'Yang, Jae Won', 'Lee, Keum Hwa', 'Kronbichler, Andreas', 'van der Vliet, Hans J', 'Grosso, Giuseppe', 'Galvano, Fabio', 'Aune, Dagfinn', 'Kim, Jong Yeob', 'Veronese, Nicola', 'Stubbs, Brendon', 'Solmi, Marco', 'Koyanagi, Ai', 'Hong, Sung Hwi', 'Dragioti, Elena', 'Cho, Eunyoung', 'de Rezende, Leandro F M', 'Giovannucci, Edward L', 'Shin, Jae Il', 'Gamerith, Gabriele']","['Kim TL', 'Jeong GH', 'Yang JW', 'Lee KH', 'Kronbichler A', 'van der Vliet HJ', 'Grosso G', 'Galvano F', 'Aune D', 'Kim JY', 'Veronese N', 'Stubbs B', 'Solmi M', 'Koyanagi A', 'Hong SH', 'Dragioti E', 'Cho E', 'de Rezende LFM', 'Giovannucci EL', 'Shin JI', 'Gamerith G']","['Yonsei University College of Medicine, Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'College of Medicine, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Korea.', 'Department of Nephrology, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', ""Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Severance Children's Hospital, Seoul, Korea."", 'Department of Internal Medicine IV (Nephrology and Hypertension), Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Amsterdam UMC, VU University, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Biomedical and Biotechnological Science, School of Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Biotechnological Science, School of Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Nutrition, Bjorknes University College, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Endocrinology, Morbid Obesity and Preventive Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Yonsei University College of Medicine, Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'National Research Council, Neuroscience Institute, Aging Branch, Padova, Italy.', ""Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK."", 'South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', 'Positive Ageing Research Institute, Faculty of Health, Social Care, Medicine and Education, Anglia Ruskin University, Chelmsford, UK.', 'Department of Neuroscience, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Deu/CIBERSAM, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'ICREA, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Yonsei University College of Medicine, Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard T.H.

Here we present a comprehensive resource of epigenomic data of human T cell precursors along with an integrative analysis of other hematopoietic populations. Although T cell commitment is accompanied by large scale epigenetic changes, we observed that the majority of distal regulatory elements are constitutively unmethylated throughout T cell differentiation, irrespective of their activation status. Among these, the TCRA gene enhancer (Ealpha) is in an open and unmethylated chromatin structure well before activation. Integrative analyses revealed that the HOXA5-9 transcription factors repress the Ealpha enhancer at early stages of T cell differentiation, while their decommission is required for TCRA locus activation and enforced alphabeta T lineage differentiation. Remarkably, the HOXA-mediated repression of Ealpha is paralleled by the ectopic expression of homeodomain-related oncogenes in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These results highlight an analogous enhancer repression mechanism at play in normal and cancer conditions, but imposing distinct developmental constraints.","['Cieslak, Agata', 'Charbonnier,

Patients with HAM/TSP have increased levels of HTLV-1-infected cells compared with asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. However, the roles of cellular genes in HTLV-1-infected CD4+ T cells await discovery. We performed microarray analysis of CD4+ T cells from HAM/TSP patients and found that the ABL1 is an important gene in HAM/TSP. ABL1 is a known survival factor for T- and B-lymphocytes and is part of the fused gene (BCR-ABL) known to be responsible for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, are used clinically for treating CML. To evaluate whether ABL1 is indeed important for HAM/TSP, we investigated the effect of TKIs on HTLV-1-infected cells. We developed a propidium monoazide-HTLV-1 viability quantitative PCR assay, which distinguishes DNA from live cells and dead cells. Using this method, we were able to measure the HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) in live cells alone when peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HAM/TSP cases were treated with TKIs. Treating the PBMCs with nilotinib or dasatinib induced significant reductions in PVL (21.0% and 17.5%, respectively) in live cells. Furthermore, ABL1 siRNA transfection reduced cell viability in HTLV-1-infected cell lines, but not in uninfected cell lines. A retrospective survey based on our clinical records found a rare case of HAM/TSP who also suffered from CML. The patient showed an 84.2% PVL reduction after CML treatment with imatinib. We conclude that inhibiting the ABL1 tyrosine kinase specifically reduced the PVL in PBMCs from patients with HAM/TSP, suggesting that ABL1 is an important gene for the survival of HTLV-1-infected cells and that TKIs may be potential therapeutic agents for HAM/TSP.","['Kodama, Daisuke', 'Tanaka, Masakazu', 'Matsuzaki, Toshio', 'Izumo, Kimiko', 'Nakano, Nobuaki', 'Matsuura, Eiji', 'Saito, Mineki', 'Nagai, Masahiro', 'Horiuchi, Masahisa', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Takashima, Hiroshi', 'Kubota, Ryuji', 'Izumo, Shuji']","['Kodama D', 'Tanaka M', 'Matsuzaki T', 'Izumo K', 'Nakano N', 'Matsuura E', 'Saito M', 'Nagai M', 'Horiuchi M', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Takashima H', 'Kubota R', 'Izumo S']","['Division of Neuroimmunology, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima City, Kagoshima, JAPAN.', 'Division of Neuroimmunology, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima City, Kagoshima, JAPAN.', 'Division of Neuroimmunology, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima City, Kagoshima, JAPAN.', 'Medical Corporation Sanshukai Ohkatsu Hospital, Kagoshima City, Kagoshima, JAPAN.', 'Division of Neuroimmunology, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima City, Kagoshima, JAPAN.', 'Department of Hygiene and Health Promotion Medicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima City, Kagoshima, JAPAN.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima City, Kagoshima, JAPAN.', 'Department of Neurology and Geriatrics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima City, Kagoshima, JAPAN.', 'Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki City, Okayama, JAPAN.', 'Department of Neurology and Clinical Pharmacology, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon City, Ehime, JAPAN.', 'Department of Hygiene and Health Promotion Medicine, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima City, Kagoshima, JAPAN.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima City, Kagoshima, JAPAN.', 'Department of Neurology and Geriatrics, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima City, Kagoshima, JAPAN.', 'Division of Neuroimmunology, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima City, Kagoshima, JAPAN.', 'Division of Neuroimmunology, Joint Research Center for Human Retrovirus Infection, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima City, Kagoshima, JAPAN.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ABL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/drug therapy/*enzymology/etiology/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proviruses/genetics/physiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spinal Cord Diseases/drug therapy/*enzymology/etiology/genetics', 'Viral Load']",,,2020/07/16 06:00,2020/08/22 06:00,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2019/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pntd.0008361 [doi]', 'PNTD-D-19-01297 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2020 Jul 15;14(7):e0008361. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0008361. eCollection 2020 Jul.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1118-4856', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4158-3471']",20200715,,,,PMC7363079,,,['NO authors have competing interests'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This radiographic finding sometimes has been said to be pathognomonic for eosinophilic granuloma (Langerhans cell histiocytosis); however, vertebra plana may also be caused by a range of other conditions. We sought to determine whether vertebra plana can be associated with malignancies other than eosinophilic granuloma. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) To report the underlying diagnoses for children with vertebra plana and determine how frequently these patients were found to have eosinophilic granuloma as opposed to an underlying malignant process, (2) to evaluate the occurrence of nondiagnostic results on biopsy, and (3) to determine whether the presenting characteristics of spinal lesions were associated with the ultimate clinical diagnosis. METHODS: As part of a retrospective review, our institutional electronic medical record was searched for all patients younger than 18 years between 1976 and 2017 whose clinical record included the term vertebra plana. Patients with trauma were excluded. Twenty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria (mean [range] age 9 years [0 to 18]; 12 girls). To address our first research purpose about the underlying diagnoses of patients with vertebra plana, we reviewed the final clinical diagnosis. To address our second research purpose about the utility of biopsy, we reviewed which patients underwent a biopsy and whether it had been diagnostic. To address our third research purpose about the radiographic criteria, we classified the radiographs and compared this to the clinical diagnosis. Vertebral collapse was described as less than 50% collapse, 50% to 100% collapse, symmetrical, and asymmetrical. The location of each lesion was noted. RESULTS: Twelve of 27 patients had a diagnosis of eosinophilic granuloma. Six of 27 had other neoplastic etiologies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, primary germ cell tumor, giant cell tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma and teratoma. Seventeen of 27 patients underwent biopsy to confirm the diagnosis; six biopsies were consistent with eosinophilic granuloma, six for other etiologies, and five were nondiagnostic. With the limited patient numbers available, there was no difference in the frequency of less than 50% loss of height or 50% to 100%, or symmetric and asymmetric loss of height, and location of the lesion among patients with eosinophilic granuloma and those with other diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilic granuloma or Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a common cause of vertebra plana, but other causes must be considered in children presenting with this radiographic finding. Six of 27 of patients presenting to our center with vertebra plana had an underlying neoplasm other than eosinophilic granuloma. With the limited patient numbers available, pain, spinal location, and the degree and symmetry of collapse were not associated with a diagnosis of eosinophilic granuloma in this series. Thus, patients presenting with vertebral plana and back pain need a comprehensive work-up and potentially tissue biopsy to determine diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

A multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the ClearLLab 10C Panels for qualitative assessment of normal versus abnormal phenotype in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymph node samples with suspected hematological malignancies. ClearLLab 10C was compared to laboratory developed tests (LDTs) and final clinical diagnosis. Four clinical sites were used to enroll patient's spent specimens (n = 453); three laboratories in North America and one in Europe. Of the 453 specimens, 198 had no malignancy and 255 contained an abnormal population. The diagnostic accuracy of the ClearLLab 10C Panels was achieved with sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 95% with respect to patient final clinical diagnosis. The agreement of phenotyping between ClearLLab10C Panels and LDTs was 98%. Any differences noted between ClearLLab 10C and LDT were due to either the presence of populations below the level of detection, the lack of clinical information provided to the evaluators, or marker(s) not present in these panels. Overall, the ClearLLab 10C demonstrated excellent agreement to LDTs and diagnosis. These four reagent panels can be adopted by individual laboratories to assess the presence or absence of malignancy.","['Hedley, Benjamin D', 'Cheng, Guoyan', 'Keeney, Michael', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Padurean, Adrian', 'Luider, Joanne', 'Chin-Yee, Ian', 'Lowes, Lori E', 'Rohrbach, Justin', 'Ortega, Robert', 'Smit, Astrid', 'Lo, Ka-Wai', 'Magari, Robert', 'Tejidor, Liliana']","['Hedley BD', 'Cheng G', 'Keeney M', 'Kern W', 'Padurean A', 'Luider J', 'Chin-Yee I', 'Lowes LE', 'Rohrbach J', 'Ortega R', 'Smit A', 'Lo KW', 'Magari R', 'Tejidor L']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, London Health Sciences Center, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, London Health Sciences Center, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Department of Immunophenotyping, Munich, Germany.', 'Neogenomics Laboratory, Inc., Department of Flow Cytometry, Fort Myers, Florida, USA.', 'Calgary Laboratory Services, Flow Cytometry Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, London Health Sciences Center, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, London Health Sciences Center, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Research, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Miami, Florida, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Moreover, this compound has been also shown to overcome the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. ACF has been shown to target hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) activity, which are key effectors of hypoxia-mediated chemoresistance. In this study, we showed that ACF inhibits the growth and survival of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cell lines in normoxic conditions. We further demonstrated that ACF down-regulates STAT5 expression in CML and AML cells but activates STAT3 in CML cells in a HIF-independent manner. In addition, we demonstrated that ACF suppresses the resistance of CML cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib. Our data suggest that the dual effect of ACF might be exploited to eradicate de novo or acquired resistance of myeloid leukaemia cells to chemotherapy.","['Hallal, Rawan', 'Nehme, Rawan', 'Brachet-Botineau, Marie', 'Nehme, Ali', 'Dakik, Hassan', 'Deynoux, Margaux', 'Dello Sbarba, Persio', 'Levern, Yves', 'Zibara, Kazem', 'Gouilleux, Fabrice', 'Mazurier, Frederic']","['Hallal R', 'Nehme R', 'Brachet-Botineau M', 'Nehme A', 'Dakik H', 'Deynoux M', 'Dello Sbarba P', 'Levern Y', 'Zibara K', 'Gouilleux F', 'Mazurier F']","['Universite de Tours, EA7501 GICC, Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL7001 LNOx, Tours, France.', 'PRASE, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Universite de Tours, EA7501 GICC, Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL7001 LNOx, Tours, France.', 'PRASE, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Universite de Tours, EA7501 GICC, Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL7001 LNOx, Tours, France.', 'Universite de Tours, EA7501 GICC, Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL7001 LNOx, Tours, France.', 'Universite de Tours, EA7501 GICC, Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL7001 LNOx, Tours, France.', 'Universite de Tours, EA7501 GICC, Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL7001 LNOx, Tours, France.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche Sperimentali e Cliniche ""Mario Serio"", Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy.', 'INRAE, Imagerie en Infectiologie, UMR Infectiologie et Sante Publique, Universite de Tours, Nouzilly, France.', 'PRASE, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Biology Department, Faculty of Sciences-I, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Universite de Tours, EA7501 GICC, Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL7001 LNOx, Tours, France.', 'Universite de Tours, EA7501 GICC, Tours, France.', 'CNRS ERL7001 LNOx, Tours, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '1T3A50395T (Acriflavine)']",IM,"['Acriflavine/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Carcinogenesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*STAT5', '*acriflavine', '*apoptosis', '*cell cycle', '*chronic myeloid leukaemia', '*resistance']",2020/07/16 06:00,2021/05/05 06:00,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.15612 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2020 Sep;24(17):10052-10062. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.15612.

Signaling via the MIF/CD74-axis has been reported to be important for the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We wanted to clarify the role of CD74 in MIF-induced signaling/leukemic development. In Emu-TCL1 transgenic mice, occurrence of the leukemic phenotype was associated with increased surface CD74 expression. Emu-TCL1(+/+)Cd74(-/-) mice showed similar kinetics and clinical features of CLL development as Emu-TCL1(+/+) mice. MIF stimulation of leukemic splenocytes led to AKT activation in a CD74-dependent manner. AKT activation was reduced in Cd74-deficient splenocytes in the presence of the oncogenic TCL1-transgene. Tumor cell apoptosis/proliferation were unaffected in Emu-TCL1(+/+)Cd74(-/-) mice. Our data suggest that the need for active CD74 signaling is overcome in the leukemic context of TCL1-driven CLL, and that CD74 may have a dispensable role for CLL pathogenesis in this model.","['Barthel, Romy', 'Fedorchenko, Oleg', 'Velmans, Tanja', 'Rosen, Natascha', 'Nguyen, Phuong-Hien', 'Reinart, Nina', 'Florin, Alexandra', 'Herling, Marco', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Fingerle-Rowson, Gunter']","['Barthel R', 'Fedorchenko O', 'Velmans T', 'Rosen N', 'Nguyen PH', 'Reinart N', 'Florin A', 'Herling M', 'Hallek M', 'Fingerle-Rowson G']","['University of Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, Germany.', ""CECAD Center of Excellence on 'Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases', Cologne, Germany."", 'CMMC Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'University of Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, Germany.', ""CECAD Center of Excellence on 'Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases', Cologne, Germany."", 'CMMC Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'University of Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, Germany.', ""CECAD Center of Excellence on 'Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases', Cologne, Germany."", 'CMMC Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'University of Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, Germany.', ""CECAD Center of Excellence on 'Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases', Cologne, Germany."", 'CMMC Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'University of Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, Germany.', ""CECAD Center of Excellence on 'Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases', Cologne, Germany."", 'CMMC Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'University of Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, Germany.', ""CECAD Center of Excellence on 'Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases', Cologne, Germany."", 'CMMC Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'University of Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, Germany.', ""CECAD Center of Excellence on 'Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases', Cologne, Germany."", 'CMMC Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'University of Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, Germany.', ""CECAD Center of Excellence on 'Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases', Cologne, Germany."", 'CMMC Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'University of Cologne, Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Cologne Duesseldorf, Germany.', ""CECAD Center of Excellence on 'Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases', Cologne, Germany."", 'CMMC Center of Molecular Medicine Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cells', '*CD74', '*CLL', '*MIF', '*TCL1']",2020/07/16 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1791851 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Dec;61(12):2799-2810. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1791851.

This antigen, one of several B lymphocyte antigens, is a target for every application used in the diagnosis of B cell lymphoma. Many anti-CD20 mAbs have been established, although applications of these antibodies are limited. This study aims to establish sensitive and specific anti-CD20 mAbs suitable for broad application, such as flow cytometry, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical analyses. Using the Cell-Based Immunization and Screening (CBIS) method, all procedures were performed by utilizing CD20-stable transfectants, and a clone, C20Mab-60 (IgG2a, kappa), was developed. In flow cytometry, C20Mab-60 detected overexpression of CD20 in LN229 cell and endogenous CD20 in BALL-1 (a human B cell leukemia cell line) but did not react with CD20-knockout BALL-1 (BINDS-24), indicating specificity for CD20. In Western blotting, C20Mab-60 detected CD20-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary-K1, BALL-1, and Raji (a human Burkitt's lymphoma cell line) displaying both sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, B cell but not T cell lymphomas were strongly stained with C20Mab-60 in immunohistochemical analyses. C20Mab-60, which was developed by CBIS method, is shown to be useful for the detection of cells expressing CD20 in lymphoma tissues by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and immunohistochemical analyses.","['Furusawa, Yoshikazu', 'Kaneko, Mika K', 'Kato, Yukinari']","['Furusawa Y', 'Kaneko MK', 'Kato Y']","['Department of Antibody Drug Development, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'New Industry Creation Hatchery Center, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Antibody Drug Development, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Antibody Drug Development, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'New Industry Creation Hatchery Center, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Monoclon Antib Immunodiagn Immunother,Monoclonal antibodies in immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy,101590955,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cricetulus', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD20', 'Western blotting', 'flow cytometry', 'immunohistochemistry', 'monoclonal antibody']",2020/07/16 06:00,2021/06/25 06:00,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/mab.2020.0015 [doi]'],ppublish,Monoclon Antib Immunodiagn Immunother. 2020 Aug;39(4):112-116. doi: 10.1089/mab.2020.0015.

In March 2018, using a modified Delphi method, we convened a panel of 13 expert MDS clinicians for three iterative rounds to discuss a minimum safe Hb for this population. While the panel was unable to reach the pre-set consensus of 75% for a specific Hb threshold, there was 100% consensus that it be no greater than 7.5 g/dL.

These data are useful in examining the reciprocal relationships between physical activity and sleep at the intrapersonal level. The purpose of this study is to test the bidirectional relationships between daily activity levels and sleep duration. The current study analyzed activity and sleep data collected from a Fitbit device as part of a 6 month employer-sponsored weight loss program. A total of 105 overweight/obese adults were included (92% female, 70% obese, and 44% Hispanic). Multilevel models were used to examine (a) whether daily active and sedentary minutes predicted that night's sleep duration and (b) whether sleep duration predicted active and sedentary minutes the following day. Potential extended effects were explored by using a 2 day average of the activity minutes/sleep duration as the predictor. No significant relationships between active minutes and sleep duration were found on a daily basis. However, having less sleep over two nights than one's usual level was associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in some physical activity the following day. There was a significant bidirectional negative association between sedentary minutes and sleep duration for both the daily and 2 day models. Data from wearable trackers, such as Fitbit, can be used to investigate the daily within-person relationship between activity levels and sleep duration. Future studies should investigate other sleep metrics that may be obtained from wearable trackers, as well as potential moderators and mediators of daily activity levels and sleep.","['Liao, Yue', 'Robertson, Michael C', 'Winne, Andrea', 'Wu, Ivan H C', 'Le, Thuan A', 'Balachandran, Diwakar D', 'Basen-Engquist, Karen M']","['Liao Y', 'Robertson MC', 'Winne A', 'Wu IHC', 'Le TA', 'Balachandran DD', 'Basen-Engquist KM']","['Department of Behavioral Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Behavioral Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Adult Bone Marrow Transplant and Leukemia, Michigan Medicine University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Health Disparities Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Behavioral Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Behavioral Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Transl Behav Med,Translational behavioral medicine,101554668,,IM,"['Adult', 'Exercise', 'Female', '*Fitness Trackers', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity', 'Sleep', '*Wearable Electronic Devices']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Free-living', '*Multilevel modeling', '*Obesity', '*Physical activity', '*Sleep tracker', '*Wearable technologies']",2020/07/16 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['5871745 [pii]', '10.1093/tbm/ibaa071 [doi]']",ppublish,Transl Behav Med. 2021 Mar 16;11(2):619-624. doi: 10.1093/tbm/ibaa071.,,,,"['(c) Society of Behavioral Medicine 2020.

Our study aimed to identify prognostic immune biomarkers of pediatric ALL and construct a risk assessment model. METHODS: Pediatric ALL patients' gene expression data were downloaded from Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) database. We screened differentially expressed IRGs (DEIRGs) between the relapse and non-relapse groups. Cox regression analysis was used to identify optimal prognostic genes, then, a risk model was constructed, and its accuracy was verified in different cohorts. RESULTS: We screened 130 DEIRGs from 251 pediatric ALL samples. The top three pathways that DEIRGs may influence tumor progression are NABA matrisome-associated, chemotaxis, and antimicrobial humoral response. A set of 84 prognostic DEIRGs was identified by using univariate Cox analysis. Then, Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression analysis screened four optimal genes (PRDX2, S100A10, RORB, and SDC1), which were used to construct the prognostic risk model. The risk score was calculated and the survival analysis results showed that high-risk score was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (p = 3.195 x 10(-7) ). The time-dependent survival receiver operating characteristic curves showed good prediction accuracy (Area Under Curves for 3-year, 5-year OS were 0.892 and 0.89, respectively). And the predictive performance of our risk model was successfully verified in testing cohort and entire cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our prognostic risk model can effectively divide pediatric ALL patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, which may help predict clinical prognosis and optimize individualized treatment.","['Quan, Xi', 'Zhang, Nan', 'Chen, Ying', 'Zeng, Hanqing', 'Deng, Jianchuan']","['Quan X', 'Zhang N', 'Chen Y', 'Zeng H', 'Deng J']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, P.R.

Patients with haematological cancer, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), are particularly at risk of complications. Very rarely, patients with extreme leukocytosis may develop spurious hypoxemia, or pseudohypoxemia, which confuses the diagnosis of complications and can lead to intervention errors. We report the case of a patient with CLL, severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 and pseudohypoxemia. LEARNING POINTS: Patients with haematological neoplasms are susceptible to viral, bacterial and fungal infections, and are thus at risk of COVID-19.Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia may rarely, due to a high lymphocyte count, present with spurious, or in vitro, hypoxemia.The clinician must identify and properly treat such cases to prevent any unnecessary treatments and their complications.","['Alves Barbosa, Orivaldo', 'Guimaraes Andrade, Talita', 'de Almeida Sousa, Maria Danielly', 'Correia, Jose Walter']","['Alves Barbosa O', 'Guimaraes Andrade T', 'de Almeida Sousa MD', 'Correia JW']","['Hospital Geral Dr. Cesar Cals, Fortaleza /Ceara, Brazil.', 'Department of Medicine, Christus University Center (UNICHRISTUS), Fortaleza /Ceara, Brazil.', 'Department of Medicine, Christus University Center (UNICHRISTUS), Fortaleza /Ceara, Brazil.', 'Department of Medicine, Christus University Center (UNICHRISTUS), Fortaleza /Ceara, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Geral Dr. Cesar Cals, Fortaleza /Ceara, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,European journal of case reports in internal medicine,101648453,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'coronavirus', 'pseudohypoxemia', 'sepsis']",2020/07/16 06:00,2020/07/16 06:01,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.12890/2020_001763 [doi]', '1763-1-14158-1-10-20200610 [pii]']",epublish,Eur J Case Rep Intern Med. 2020 Jun 11;7(7):001763. doi: 10.12890/2020_001763. eCollection 2020.,,20200611,,['(c) EFIM 2020.'],,PMC7350966,,,"['Conflicts of Interests: The Authors declare that there are no competing', 'interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the development of chemoresistance in vivo remain unclear. Methods: Using intravital bone imaging, we characterized the behavior of murine acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (C1498) in the bone marrow before and after chemotherapy with cytarabine. Results: Proliferative C1498 cells exhibited high motility in the bone marrow. Cytarabine treatment impaired the motility of residual C1498 cells. However, C1498 cells regained their migration potential after relapse. RNA sequencing revealed that cytarabine treatment promoted MRTF-SRF pathway activation. MRTF inhibition using CCG-203971 augmented the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy in our AML mouse model, as well as suppressed the migration of chemoresistant C1498 cells. Conclusions: These results provide novel insight into the role of cell migration arrest on the development of chemoresistance in AML, as well as provide a strong rationale for the modulation of cellular motility as a therapeutic target for refractory AML.","['Morimatsu, Maho', 'Yamashita, Erika', 'Seno, Shigeto', 'Sudo, Takao', 'Kikuta, Junichi', 'Mizuno, Hiroki', 'Okuzaki, Daisuke', 'Motooka, Daisuke', 'Ishii, Masaru']","['Morimatsu M', 'Yamashita E', 'Seno S', 'Sudo T', 'Kikuta J', 'Mizuno H', 'Okuzaki D', 'Motooka D', 'Ishii M']","['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'WPI-Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'Laboratory of Bioimaging and Drug Discovery, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Osaka, Japan.grid.482562.f', 'Department of Bioinformatic Engineering, Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'WPI-Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'Laboratory of Bioimaging and Drug Discovery, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Osaka, Japan.grid.482562.f', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'WPI-Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'Laboratory of Bioimaging and Drug Discovery, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Osaka, Japan.grid.482562.f', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'WPI-Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'WPI-Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'Genome Information Research Center, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'Genome Information Research Center, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine and Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'WPI-Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.grid.136593.b0000 0004 0373 3971', 'Laboratory of Bioimaging and Drug Discovery, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Osaka, Japan.grid.482562.f']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Inflamm Regen,Inflammation and regeneration,101479577,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow', 'Cancer therapy', 'Cell migration', 'Cell motility', 'Chemoresistance', 'In vivo imaging', 'Leukemia', 'Microscopic imaging', 'Serum response factor (SRF)']",2020/07/16 06:00,2020/07/16 06:01,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s41232-020-00127-6 [doi]', '127 [pii]']",epublish,Inflamm Regen. 2020 Jul 6;40:15. doi: 10.1186/s41232-020-00127-6. eCollection 2020.,,20200706,,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],,PMC7336645,,,"['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.

In particular, patients with t(4;14)-positive disease have worse prognosis compared to other MM subtypes. Herein, we demonstrated that t(4;14)-positive cells are highly dependent on the mevalonate (MVA) pathway for survival. Moreover, we showed that this metabolic vulnerability is immediately actionable, as inhibiting the MVA pathway with a statin preferentially induced apoptosis in t(4;14)-positive cells. In response to statin treatment, t(4;14)-positive cells activated the integrated stress response (ISR), which was augmented by co-treatment with bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor. We identified that t(4;14)-positive cells depend on the MVA pathway for the synthesis of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), as exogenous GGPP fully rescued statin-induced ISR activation and apoptosis. Inhibiting protein geranylgeranylation similarly induced the ISR in t(4;14)-positive cells, suggesting that this subtype of MM depends on GGPP, at least in part, for protein geranylgeranylation. Notably, fluvastatin treatment synergized with bortezomib to induce apoptosis in t(4;14)-positive cells and potentiated the anti-tumor activity of bortezomib in vivo. Our data implicate the t(4;14) translocation as a biomarker of statin sensitivity and warrant further clinical evaluation of a statin in combination with bortezomib for the treatment of t(4;14)-positive disease.","['Longo, Joseph', 'Smirnov, Petr', 'Li, Zhihua', 'Branchard, Emily', 'van Leeuwen, Jenna E', 'Licht, Jonathan D', 'Haibe-Kains, Benjamin', 'Andrews, David W', 'Keats, Jonathan J', 'Pugh, Trevor J', 'Trudel, Suzanne', 'Penn, Linda Z']","['Longo J', 'Smirnov P', 'Li Z', 'Branchard E', 'van Leeuwen JE', 'Licht JD', 'Haibe-Kains B', 'Andrews DW', 'Keats JJ', 'Pugh TJ', 'Trudel S', 'Penn LZ']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Vector Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Vector Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.

To illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of each donor source, we performed a nationwide retrospective study of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) of patients with allo-HSCT-treated ATL. One-year GRFS did not significantly differ between patients who received related bone marrow transplantation (R-BMT; 26%, n = 117), related peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (R-PBSCT; 22%, n = 225), unrelated bone marrow transplantation (UR-BMT; 26%, n = 619), and cord blood transplantation (CBT; 21%, n = 359; p = 0.09). This was attributable to a low incidence of systemically-treated chronic GVHD after CBT (9% at 1 year) and reduced non-GVHD/relapse mortality after R-PBSCT (9% at 1 year). Among patients transplanted in complete remission (CR), 1-year overall survival after CBT (52%, n = 132) was not inferior to that after R-BMT (55%, n = 51), R-PBSCT (57%, n = 79), and UR-BMT (58%, n = 280; p = 0.15), and relapse rates were equivalent among the four sources (p = 0.19). Our results suggest that all donor sources are feasible for CR patients and that GRFS provides important clues toward optimizing allo-HSCT for ATL.","['Muranushi, Hiroyuki', 'Shindo, Takero', 'Hishizawa, Masakatsu', 'Tokunaga, Masahito', 'Wake, Atsushi', 'Nakano, Nobuaki', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Hidaka, Michihiro', 'Choi, Ilseung', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Moriuchi, Yukiyoshi', 'Miyazaki, Yasuhiko', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Kato, Koji']","['Muranushi H', 'Shindo T', 'Hishizawa M', 'Tokunaga M', 'Wake A', 'Nakano N', 'Eto T', 'Hidaka M', 'Choi I', 'Miyamoto T', 'Uchida N', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Fukuda T', 'Ichinohe T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Kato K']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan. takeros@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Toranomon Hospital Kajigaya, Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sasebo City General Hospital, Sasebo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oita Prefectural Hospital, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Science, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', '*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/therapy', '*Lymphoma', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2020/07/16 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-00996-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-00996-y [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2021 Jan;56(1):155-166. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-00996-y.

Microencapsulation of these cancer cells can protect the core from the harmful effects of the neighboring cellular environment and can supply nutrients and oxygen. Such an encapsulation technique ensures cell viability and enables targeted drug delivery in cancer therapy. The cells immobilized with a biocompatible shell material can be isolated from the ambient and can move in constricted microcapillary. However, transportation of these cells through the narrow microcapillary may squeeze and mechanically damage the cells which threaten the cell viability. The cell type, conditions and the viscoelastic properties of the shell can dictate cell viability. A front-tracking numerical simulation shows that the engineered shell material with higher viscoelasticity improves the cell viability. It is also shown that low cortical tension of cells can contribute to lower cell viability.","['Nooranidoost, Mohammad', 'Kumar, Ranganathan']","['Nooranidoost M', 'Kumar R']","['Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA.', 'Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA. ranganathan.kumar@ucf.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['0 (Biocompatible Materials)'],IM,"['Biocompatible Materials/*pharmacology', 'Cell Encapsulation/methods', 'Cell Survival/genetics', '*Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Rheology']",,,2020/07/16 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-67739-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-67739-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jul 14;10(1):11570. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-67739-3.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6326-9213'],20200714,,,,PMC7360627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One understudied source of transcriptional regulators are transposable elements (TEs), whose aberrant usage could contribute to oncogenic transcriptional circuits. However, the regulatory influence of TEs and their links to AML pathogenesis remain unexplored. Here we identify six endogenous retrovirus (ERV) families with AML-associated enhancer chromatin signatures that are enriched in binding of key regulators of hematopoiesis and AML pathogenesis. Using both locus-specific genetic editing and simultaneous epigenetic silencing of multiple ERVs, we demonstrate that ERV deregulation directly alters the expression of adjacent genes in AML.

Human SERINC5 and SERINC3 were recently shown to possess antiretroviral activity for a number of retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). In the case of MLV, the glycosylated Gag (glyco-Gag) protein was shown to counteract SERINC5-mediated restriction in in vitro experiments and the viral envelope was found to determine virion sensitivity or resistance to SERINC5. However, nothing is known about the in vivo function of SERINC5. Antiretroviral function of a host factor in vitro is not always associated with antiretroviral function in vivo Using SERINC5(-/-) mice that we had generated, we showed that mouse SERINC5 (mSERINC5) restriction of MLV infection in vivo is influenced not only by glyco-Gag but also by the retroviral envelope. Finally, we also examined the in vivo function of the other SERINC gene with known antiretroviral functions, SERINC3. By using SERINC3(-/-) mice, we found that the murine homologue, mSERINC3, had no antiretroviral role either in vivo or in vitro To our knowledge, this report provides the first data showing that SERINC5 restricts retrovirus infection in vivo and that restriction of retrovirus infectivity in vivo is dependent on the presence of both glyco-Gag and the viral envelope.IMPORTANCE This study examined for the first time the in vivo function of the serine incorporator (SERINC) proteins during retrovirus infection. SERINC3 and SERINC5 (SERINC3/5) restrict a number of retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and murine leukemia virus (MLV), by blocking their entry into cells. Nevertheless, HIV-1 and MLV encode factors, Nef and glycosylated Gag, respectively, that counteract SERINC3/5 in vitro We recently developed SERINC3 and SERINC5 knockout mice to examine the in vivo function of these genes. We found that SERINC5 restriction is dependent on the absence of glycosylated Gag and the expression of a specific viral envelope glycoprotein. On the other hand, SERINC3 had no antiviral function. Our findings have implications for the development of therapeutics that target SERINC5 during retrovirus infection.","['Timilsina, Uddhav', 'Umthong, Supawadee', 'Lynch, Brian', 'Stablewski, Aimee', 'Stavrou, Spyridon']","['Timilsina U', 'Umthong S', 'Lynch B', 'Stablewski A', 'Stavrou S']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, New York, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, USA stavrou2@buffalo.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Serinc3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Serinc5 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Glycosylation', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*virology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*SERINC3', '*SERINC5', '*antiretroviral response', '*glycosylated gag', '*in vivo model']",2020/07/16 06:00,2021/07/16 06:00,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/16 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.00588-20 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.00588-20 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2020 Jul 14;11(4). pii: mBio.00588-20. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00588-20.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3962-8917'],20200714,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Timilsina et al.'],['R21 AI144147/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7360926,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is uncertainty about how and whether older patients with AML should receive cytotoxic treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline and Cochrane library search was performed for studies in newly diagnosed AML which enrolled at least 20 patients per arm (for randomized controlled trials), or 50 patients (for non-randomized studies) over the age of 70. References were hand searched for additional eligible studies. Study investigators were contacted to maximize relevant data. Dual independent data extraction was done using standardized data collection forms. Data was collected on study and treatment characteristics, baseline patient information, and outcomes. Study methodological quality was assessed. The primary outcome was 1 year overall survival (OS). Impact of treatment [intensive chemotherapy (INT), low-dose chemotherapy (LOW), hypomethylating agents (HMA), or best supportive care (BSC)], cytogenetics, performance status, and comorbidity were assessed. RESULTS: The search produced 11,846 references of which 38 randomized controlled trials and 30 non-randomized studies met inclusion criteria, representing 13,381 patients, with a worldwide distribution. One-year OS with INT was 37% (31-42%), with LOW 11% (6-18%), with HMA 35% (18-54%) and with BSC 17%(13-21%). Two-year OS was 22% (18-26%), 11% (7-15%), 22% (16-28%), 6% (2-12%), respectively. We present subgroup data based on the studies including cytogenetics, performance status, and comorbidity. Formal direct comparisons with adjustment for all prognostic factors were not possible. CONCLUSIONS: In this largest to date series of AML patients aged 70 and older, we provide benchmarks for treatment efficacy and effectiveness that may be used for decision analysis models and for the future development of clinical trials focusing on these patients.","['Reljic, Tea', 'Sehovic, Marina', 'Lancet, Jeffrey', 'Kim, Jongphil', 'Al Ali, Najla', 'Djulbegovic, Benjamin', 'Extermann, Martine']","['Reljic T', 'Sehovic M', 'Lancet J', 'Kim J', 'Al Ali N', 'Djulbegovic B', 'Extermann M']","['Program for Comparative Effectiveness Research, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Senior Adult Oncology Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Oncology Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA; Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Oncology Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA; Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Program for Evidence-based Medicine & Comparative Effectiveness Research, Departments of Supportive Medicine and Hematology, City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA.', 'Senior Adult Oncology Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA; Department of Oncology Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.

METHODS: Data on mortality and causes of death in Chinese children and adolescents aged 5-19 years were extracted from the China Health Statistics Yearbook and the Global Burden of Disease Study from 1953 to 2016. Mortality variations were analyzed by year, age, sex, province, and causes of death. RESULTS: The mortality of Chinese children and adolescents aged 5-19 years declined steadily from 1953 (366.03/100,000) to 2016 (27.21), with the largest reduction in adolescents aged 15-19 years and the smallest reduction in those aged 10-14 years. Large subnational disparities for all-cause mortality existed in national 31 provinces with higher mortality in western regions compared with eastern regions, but with narrowing disparities between 1981 and 2010. Injuries dominated the causes of death compared with noncommunicable diseases and communicable, maternal and neonatal, and nutritional diseases from 1990 (58.13/100,000 vs. 32.10 and 14.31) to 2016 (22.65 vs. 13.00 and 2.93). In 2016, the leading three causes of death were road injuries (8.30/100,000), drowning (7.25), and leukemia (2.60). Drowning was the leading cause of death for 5- to 14-year-olds, but road injuries have been the leading cause for 15- to 19-year-olds of both sexes since 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Although mortality in Chinese adolescents now stands at just 7% of rates in the 1950s, there is a need to address continuing inequalities across sex, economic status, and region.","['Dong, Yanhui', 'Hu, Peijin', 'Song, Yi', 'Dong, Bin', 'Zou, Zhiyong', 'Wang, Zhenghe', 'Xu, Rongbin', 'Luo, Dongmei', 'Gao, Disi', 'Wen, Bo', 'Ma, Yinghua', 'Ma, Jun', 'Tian, Xiaobo', 'Huang, Xiaona', 'Narayan, Anuradha', 'Patton, George C']","['Dong Y', 'Hu P', 'Song Y', 'Dong B', 'Zou Z', 'Wang Z', 'Xu R', 'Luo D', 'Gao D', 'Wen B', 'Ma Y', 'Ma J', 'Tian X', 'Huang X', 'Narayan A', 'Patton GC']","['Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Peking University, National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Reproductive Health, Beijing, China.

The multicenter, open-label study randomized patients to receive glasdegib + LDAC (n = 78) or LDAC alone (n = 38). The rate of complete remission (CR) was 19.2% in the glasdegib + LDAC arm versus 2.6% in the LDAC arm (P = 0.015). METHODS: This post hoc analysis determines whether the clinical benefits of glasdegib are restricted to patients who achieve CR, or if they extend to those who do not achieve CR. RESULTS: In patients who did not achieve CR, the addition of glasdegib to LDAC improved overall survival (OS) versus LDAC alone (hazard ratio = 0.63 [95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.98]; P = 0.0182; median OS, 5.0 vs 4.1 months). Additionally, more patients receiving glasdegib + LDAC achieved durable recovery of absolute neutrophil count (>/= 1000/mul, 45.6% vs 35.5%), hemoglobin (>/= 9 g/dl, 54.4% vs 38.7%), and platelets (>/= 100,000/mul, 29.8% vs 9.7%). Transfusion independence was achieved by 15.0% and 2.9% of patients receiving glasdegib + LDAC and LDAC alone, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data suggest that there are clinical benefits with glasdegib in the absence of CR.

RASSF10 plays an important role in inhibiting proliferation, invasion, and migration, inducing apoptosis, making cancer cells sensitive to docetaxel, and capturing G2/M phase. Some studies have found that RASSF10 may inhibit the occurrence and development of tumors by regulating Wnt/beta-catenin, P53, and MMP2. Methylation of tumor suppressor gene promoter is a key factor in the development and progression of many tumors. Various methylation detection methods confirmed that the methylation and downregulation of RASSF10 often occur in various tumors, such as gastric cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, and leukemia. The status of RASSF10 methylation is positively correlated with tumor size, tumor type, and TNM stage. RASSF10 methylation can be used as a prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival, and is also a sign of tumor diagnosis and sensitivity to docetaxel chemotherapy. In this review, we mainly elucidate the acknowledged structure and progress in the verified functions of RASSF10 and the probably relevant signaling pathways.","['Hou, Yulong', 'Li, Shuofeng', 'Du, Wei', 'Li, Hailong', 'Wen, Rumin']","['Hou Y', 'Li S', 'Du W', 'Li H', 'Wen R']","['Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu, China.', 'Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China.', 'Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu, China.', 'Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China.', 'Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RASSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*RASSF10', '*function', '*mechanism', '*promoter hypermethylation', '*therapeutic target', '*tumor suppressor']",2020/07/16 06:00,2021/06/08 06:00,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2019/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-108168 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520620666200714141906 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2020;20(18):2207-2215. doi: 10.2174/1871520620666200714141906.,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the past, patients at high risk of invasive mucomycosis (IM) were those affected by acute myeloid leukemia but over the last ten years the prophylaxis with a very effective mold-active drug, such as posaconazole, has completely modified the epidemiology. In fact, IM is now observed more frequently in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders who do not receive antifungal prophylaxis. AREAS COVERED: The attention was focused on the epidemiology, diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment of IM in HMs. Authors excluded pediatric patients considering the different epidemiology and differences in treatment given the limitation of the use of azoles in the pediatric field. A systematic literature review was performed using PubMed database listings between February 2014 and February 2020 using the following MeSH terms: leukemia, hematological malignancies, stem cell transplantation, mucormycosis, molds, prophilaxis, treatment. EXPERT OPINION: The epidemiology of mucormycosis in HMs is changing in the last years. The availability of drugs more effective than in the past against this infection has reduced the mortality; however, a timely diagnosis remains a relevant problem potentially influencing the outcome of hematologic patients with IM.","['Pagano, Livio', 'Dragonetti, Giulia', 'De Carolis, Elena', 'Veltri, Giuseppe', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Busca, Alessandro']","['Pagano L', 'Dragonetti G', 'De Carolis E', 'Veltri G', 'Del Principe MI', 'Busca A']","['Hematology Section, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli- IRCCS , Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Universita Cattolica Del Sacro Cuore , Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Section, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli- IRCCS , Rome, Italy.', 'Microbiology Section, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli- IRCCS , Rome, Italy.', 'Radiology Section, Universita Cattolica Del Sacro Cuore , Rome, Italy.', 'Ematologia, Dipartimento Di Biomedicina E Prevenzione, Universita Degli Studi Di Roma ""Tor Vergata"" , Roma, Italy.', ""Stem Cell Transplant Center, AOU Citta' Della Salute E Della Scienza , Turin, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,IM,"['Clinical Decision-Making', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Mucormycosis/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology/*therapy', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis', 'Prognosis', 'Retreatment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute leukemia', '*fungal', '*mucormycosis', '*prophylaxis']",2020/07/16 06:00,2021/05/27 06:00,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2020.1796624 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2020 Aug;13(8):895-905. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2020.1796624.

Particularly, understanding the role of Bruton tyrosine kinase and phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase delta in driving prosurvival signal transduction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and their targeting with pharmacological inhibitors (ibrutinib and idelalisib, respectively) has improved patient outcomes significantly. The kinase signaling pathway induced by the BcR is highly complex and has multiple interconnecting branches mediated by tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases activated downstream of the BcR. There is a high level of redundancy in the biological responses, with several BcR-signaling kinases driving nuclear factor kappa B activation or inducing antiapoptotic Bcl-2 genes. Accordingly, common gene targets of BcR-signaling kinases may serve as biomarkers indicating enhanced BCR-signaling and aggressive disease progression. This study used a gene expression correlation analysis of malignant B cell lines and primary CLL cells to identify genes whose expression correlated with BCR-signaling kinases overexpressed and/or overactivated in CLL, namely: AKT1, AKT2, BTK, MAPK1, MAPK3, PI3KCD and ZAP70. The analysis identified a 32-gene signature with a strong prognostic potential and DNPEP, the gene coding for aspartic aminopeptidase, as a predictor of aggressive CLL. DNPEP gene expression correlated with MAPK3, PI3KCD, and ZAP70 expression and, in the primary CLL test dataset, showed a strong prognostic potential. The inhibition of DNPEP with a pharmacological inhibitor enhanced the cytotoxic potential of idelalisib and ibrutinib, indicating a biological functionality of DNPEP in CLL. DNPEP, as an aminopeptidase, contributes to the maintenance of the free amino acid pool in CLL cells found to be an essential process for the survival of many cancer cell types, and thus, these results warrant further research into the exploitation of aminopeptidase inhibitors in the treatment of drug-resistant CLL.","['Kakodkar, Pramath', 'More, Sanket', 'Andras, Kinga', 'Papakonstantinou, Nikos', 'Kelly, Sharon', 'Makrooni, Mohammad Adib', 'Ortutay, Csaba', 'Szegezdi, Eva']","['Kakodkar P', 'More S', 'Andras K', 'Papakonstantinou N', 'Kelly S', 'Makrooni MA', 'Ortutay C', 'Szegezdi E']","['Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, H91 W2TY Galway, Ireland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, H91 W2TY Galway, Ireland.', 'HiDucator Ltd., Eramiehentie 2 E 22, 36200 Kangasala, Finland.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, 57001 Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, H91 W2TY Galway, Ireland.', 'School of Mathematics, Statistics and Applied Mathematics, National University of Ireland Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland.', 'HiDucator Ltd., Eramiehentie 2 E 22, 36200 Kangasala, Finland.', 'Apoptosis Research Centre, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland Galway, H91 W2TY Galway, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Akt', 'B-cell receptor (BcR) signaling', 'Bruton tyrosine kinase', 'DNPEP', 'aspartic aminopeptidase', 'biomarker', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)', 'phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase']",2020/07/16 06:00,2020/07/16 06:01,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/16 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12071876 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12071876 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jul 12;12(7). pii: cancers12071876. doi: 10.3390/cancers12071876.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5288-1247', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5708-3535']",20200712,,,"['BCNI,14/ICS/B3042/Irish Cancer Society', '16/IA/4612./SFI_/Science Foundation Ireland/Ireland']",PMC7408864,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathophysiology of the disease depends on cytogenetic abnormalities, gene mutations, aberrant gene expressions, and altered epigenetic regulation. Although new pharmacological agents have emerged during the last years, the prognosis is still dismal and new therapeutic strategies are needed. The transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is regarded a possible therapeutic target. In this study, we investigated the alterations in the global gene expression profile (GEP) in primary AML cells derived from 16 consecutive patients after exposure to the NF-kappaB inhibitor BMS-345541. We identified a profound and highly discriminative transcriptomic profile associated with NF-kappaB inhibition. Bioinformatical analyses identified cytokine/interleukin signaling, metabolic regulation, and nucleic acid binding/transcription among the major biological functions influenced by NF-kappaB inhibition. Furthermore, several key genes involved in leukemogenesis, among them RUNX1 and CEBPA, in addition to NFKB1 itself, were influenced by NF-kappaB inhibition. Finally, we identified a significant impact of NF-kappaB inhibition on the expression of genes included in a leukemic stem cell (LSC) signature, indicating possible targeting of LSCs.

Both proteins preferentially bind uridine-rich sequences upstream of 3'ss via their RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). Here, we examined 36 RRM substitutions reported in cancer patients to identify variants that alter 3'ss selection, RNA binding and protein properties. Employing PUF60- and U2AF65-dependent 3'ss previously identified by RNA-seq of depleted cells, we found that 43% (10/23) and 15% (2/13) of independent RRM mutations in U2AF65 and PUF60, respectively, conferred splicing defects. At least three RRM mutations increased skipping of internal U2AF2 (~9%, 2/23) or PUF60 (~8%, 1/13) exons, indicating that cancer-associated RRM mutations can have both cis- and trans-acting effects on splicing. We also report residues required for correct folding/stability of each protein and map functional RRM substitutions on to existing high-resolution structures of U2AF65 and PUF60. These results identify new RRM residues critical for 3'ss selection and provide relatively simple tools to detect clonal RRM mutations that enhance the mRNA isoform diversity.","['Kralovicova, Jana', 'Borovska, Ivana', 'Kubickova, Monika', 'Lukavsky, Peter J', 'Vorechovsky, Igor']","['Kralovicova J', 'Borovska I', 'Kubickova M', 'Lukavsky PJ', 'Vorechovsky I']","['Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Center of Biosciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences, 840 05 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Center of Biosciences, Slovak Academy of Sciences, 840 05 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'CEITEC, Masaryk University, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'CEITEC, Masaryk University, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"[""3' splice site"", 'Functional genomics', 'PUF60', 'SF3B4', 'U2AF2', 'cancer', 'differential scanning fluorimetry', 'driver mutation', 'exon inclusion', 'gel shift assay', 'lariat branch point', 'leukemia', 'mRNA', 'pre-mRNA splicing']",2020/07/16 06:00,2020/07/16 06:01,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/16 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12071865 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12071865 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jul 11;12(7). pii: cancers12071865. doi: 10.3390/cancers12071865.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7680-9453', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2935-1579', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6740-6502']",20200711,,,"['12060/Bloodwise', 'APVV-18-0096/SRDA', '2-0057-18/VEGA', 'PCIG14-GA-2013-630758/Marie Curie Career Integration Grannt']",PMC7408900,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NUP98-HOXA9 and SET-NUP214 chimeras result from recurrent chromosomal translocations in acute leukemia. Functionally, the two fusion proteins inhibit nuclear export and interact with epigenetic regulators. The full interactome of NUP98-HOXA9 and SET-NUP214 is currently unknown. We used proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) to study the landscape of the NUP98-HOXA9 and SET-NUP214 environments. Our results suggest that both fusion proteins interact with major regulators of RNA processing, with translation-associated proteins, and that both chimeras perturb the transcriptional program of the tumor suppressor p53. Other cellular processes appear to be distinctively affected by the particular fusion protein. NUP98-HOXA9 likely perturbs Wnt, MAPK, and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling pathways, as well as the cytoskeleton, the latter likely due to its interaction with the nuclear export receptor CRM1. Conversely, mitochondrial proteins and metabolic regulators are significantly overrepresented in the SET-NUP214 proximal interactome. Our study provides new clues on the mechanistic actions of nucleoporin fusion proteins and might be of particular relevance in the search for new druggable targets for the treatment of nucleoporin-related leukemia.","['Mendes, Adelia', 'Juhlen, Ramona', 'Bousbata, Sabrina', 'Fahrenkrog, Birthe']","['Mendes A', 'Juhlen R', 'Bousbata S', 'Fahrenkrog B']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 6041 Charleroi, Belgium.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 6041 Charleroi, Belgium.', 'Present address: Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, RWTH Aachen University, 52074 Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 6041 Charleroi, Belgium.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Medicine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 6041 Charleroi, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)']",IM,"['Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteomics/*methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BioID', '*NUP98-HOXA9', '*SET-NUP214', '*gene ontology', '*interactome', '*leukemia']",2020/07/16 06:00,2021/04/13 06:00,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9071666 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9071666 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Jul 10;9(7). pii: cells9071666. doi: 10.3390/cells9071666.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5689-9030', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6548-9108', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4080-9413']",20200710,,,,PMC7407662,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One-dimensional (1D) semiconductor nanostructures (e.g., ZnO nanorods) have attracted attention due to their potential use in cancer biosensors. In the current study, it was demonstrated that the possibility of a photoluminescent detection of human leukemic T-cells by using a zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO NRs) platform. Monoclonal antibodies (MABs) anti-CD5 against a cluster of differentiation (CD) proteins on the pathologic cell surface have been used as a bioselective layer on the ZnO surface. The optimal concentration of the protein anti-CD5 to form an effective bioselective layer on the ZnO NRs surface was selected. The novel biosensing platforms based on glass/ZnO NRs/anti-CD5 were tested towards the human T-lymphoblast cell line MOLT-4 derived from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The control tests towards MOLT-4 cells were performed by using the glass/ZnO NRs/anti-IgG2a system as a negative control. It was shown that the photoluminescence signal of the glass/ZnO NRs/anti-CD5 system increased after adsorption of T-lymphoblast MOLT-4 cells on the biosensor surface. The increase in the ZnO NRs photoluminescence intensity correlated with the number of CD5-positive MOLT-4 cells in the investigated population (controlled by using flow cytometry). Perspectives of the developed ZnO platforms as an efficient cancer cell biosensor were discussed.","['Tamashevski, Alexander', 'Harmaza, Yuliya', 'Slobozhanina, Ekaterina', 'Viter, Roman', 'Iatsunskyi, Igor']","['Tamashevski A', 'Harmaza Y', 'Slobozhanina E', 'Viter R', 'Iatsunskyi I']","['Institute of Biophysics and Cell Engineering of National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, Akademicheskaya St. 27, Minsk 220072, Belarus.', 'Institute of Biophysics and Cell Engineering of National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, Akademicheskaya St. 27, Minsk 220072, Belarus.', 'Institute of Biophysics and Cell Engineering of National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, Akademicheskaya St. 27, Minsk 220072, Belarus.', 'Institute of Atomic Physics and Spectroscopy, University of Latvia, 19, Raina Blvd, 1586 Riga, Latvia.', 'Center for Collective Use of Scientific Equipment, Sumy State University, 31, Sanatornaya str., 40018 Sumy, Ukraine.', 'NanoBioMedical Centre, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Wszechnicy Piastowskiej str. 3, 61-614 Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', 'SOI2LOH54Z (Zinc Oxide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Biosensing Techniques/methods', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Glass/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Measurements/methods', 'Nanostructures/chemistry', 'Nanotubes/*chemistry', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Zinc Oxide/*chemistry']",['NOTNLM'],"['MOLT-4 cell line', 'T-lymphoblasts detection', 'cluster of differentiation proteins', 'monoclonal antibody anti-CD5', 'room temperature photoluminescence', 'zinc oxide nanorods']",2020/07/16 06:00,2021/02/26 06:00,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25143168 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25143168 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Jul 10;25(14). pii: molecules25143168. doi: 10.3390/molecules25143168.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9420-7376'],20200710,,,"['778157/H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions', 'B20MC-029/Belarusian Republican Foundation for Fundamental Research']",PMC7397042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a chaperone of both nucleic acids and proteins and plays a role in cell cycle control, centrosome duplication, ribosome maturation and export, as well as the cellular response to a variety of stress stimuli. NPM1 is a hub protein in nucleoli where it contributes to nucleolar organization through heterotypic and homotypic interactions. Furthermore, several alterations, including overexpression, chromosomal translocations and mutations are present in solid and hematological cancers. Recently, novel germline mutations that cause dyskeratosis congenita have also been described. This review focuses on NPM1 interactions and inhibition. Indeed, the list of NPM1 binding partners is ever-growing and, in recent years, many studies contributed to clarifying the structural basis for NPM1 recognition of both nucleic acids and several proteins. Intriguingly, a number of natural and synthetic ligands that interfere with NPM1 interactions have also been reported. The possible role of NPM1 inhibitors in the treatment of multiple cancers and other pathologies is emerging as a new therapeutic strategy.","['Cela, Ilaria', 'Di Matteo, Adele', 'Federici, Luca']","['Cela I', 'Di Matteo A', 'Federici L']","['Center for Advanced Studies and Technology (CAST), University of Chieti ""G. d\'Annunzio"", Via Polacchi, 66100 Chieti, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, University of Chieti ""G. d\'Annunzio"", Via dei Vestini 31, 66100 Chieti, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology and Pathology (IBPM) of the CNR, c/o ""Sapienza University of Rome, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, 00185 Roma, Italy.', 'Center for Advanced Studies and Technology (CAST), University of Chieti ""G. d\'Annunzio"", Via Polacchi, 66100 Chieti, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, University of Chieti ""G. d\'Annunzio"", Via dei Vestini 31, 66100 Chieti, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acids/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Proteins/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'B23', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cancer', 'nucleophosmin', 'protein-nucleic acids interactions', 'protein-protein interactions']",2020/07/16 06:00,2021/02/18 06:00,['2020/07/16 06:00'],"['2020/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21144885 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21144885 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jul 10;21(14). pii: ijms21144885. doi: 10.3390/ijms21144885.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5921-7365'],20200710,,,['IG2014-15197/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro'],PMC7402337,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the conventional drugs used to treat CLL patients have been effective treatment failure rate in some of the patients is alarming. Therefore, as a result, novel treatment strategies with improved outcomes such as the blockade of immune checkpoints have emerged. However, consensus on the risk-benefit effects of the using these drugs in patients with CLL is controversial and has not been comprehensively evaluated. This systemic review and meta-analysis provide a comprehensive synthesis of available data assessing adverse events associated with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with CLL as well as their influence on the overall survival rate. METHODS: This protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis has been prepared in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols 2015 guidelines. A search strategy will be developed using medical subject headings words in PubMed search engine with MEDLINE database. The search terms will also be adapted for gray literature, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials electronic databases. Two reviewers (AN and SRN) will independently screen studies, with a third reviewer consulted in cases of disagreements using a defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data items will be extracted using a predefined data extraction sheet. Moreover, the risk of bias and quality of the included studies will be appraised using the Downs and Black checklist and the quality and strengths of evidence across selected studies will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation approach. The Cochran's Q statistic and the I statistics will be used to analyze statistical heterogeneity across studies. If the included studies show substantial level of statistical heterogeneity (I > 50%), a random-effects meta-analysis will be performed using R statistical software. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The review and meta-analysis will not require ethical approval and the findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at local and international conferences. This review may help provide clarity on the risk-benefit effects of using immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with CLL.

However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. METHODS: We investigated the antiviral activities of exosomes from responders and nonresponders to pegylated IFN-alpha (PegIFN-alpha) as well as the supernatants of IFN-alpha-treated macrophages derived from THP-1 (the human leukemia monocyte cell line). Then the expression profiles of exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) were analyzed using miRNA sequencing. The luciferase reporter assay was used to locate the binding position of HBV genomic sequence targeted by the identified miRNA. RESULTS: Exosomes from PegIFN-alpha-treated patients, particularly responders, as well as the supernatants of IFN-alpha-treated macrophages exhibited anti-HBV activities, as manifested by the suppression of hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B e antigen, HBV DNA, and covalently closed circular DNA levels in HBV-related cell lines. PegIFN-alpha treatment up-regulated exosomal hsa-miR-193a-5p, hsa-miR-25-5p, and hsa-miR-574-5p, which could partially inhibit HBV replication and transcription, and hsa-miR-574-5p reduced pregenomic RNA and polymerase messenger RNA levels by binding to the 2750-2757 position of the HBV genomic sequence. CONCLUSIONS: Exosomes can transfer IFN-alpha-related miRNAs from macrophages to HBV-infected hepatocytes, and they exhibit antiviral activities against HBV replication and expression.","['Wu, Wenyu', 'Wu, Di', 'Yan, Weiming', 'Wang, Yongli', 'You, Jie', 'Wan, Xiaoyang', 'Xi, Dong', 'Luo, Xiaoping', 'Han, Meifang', 'Ning, Qin']","['Wu W', 'Wu D', 'Yan W', 'Wang Y', 'You J', 'Wan X', 'Xi D', 'Luo X', 'Han M', 'Ning Q']","['Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department and Institute of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Infect Dis,The Journal of infectious diseases,0413675,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (MIRN574 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '5968Y6H45M (entecavir)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Exosomes/*metabolism', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Hepatitis B virus/*drug effects/physiology', 'Hepatitis B, Chronic/*drug therapy/virology', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Macrophages/immunology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HBV cccDNA', '*IFN-alpha', '*exosome', '*hsa-miR-574-5p', '*pgRNA']",2020/07/15 06:00,2021/11/06 06:00,['2020/07/15 06:00'],"['2020/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['5871440 [pii]', '10.1093/infdis/jiaa399 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect Dis. 2021 Feb 24;223(4):686-698. doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiaa399.,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

These observations disqualify these compounds from further development as antimicrobial agents, but they can be considered potential multi-target drugs with a preferred anticancer effect with good water solubility and additional anti-infectious activity.","['Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Malik, Ivan', 'Curillova, Jana', 'Michnova, Hana', 'Cerna, Lucie', 'Padrtova, Tereza', 'Hosek, Jan', 'Pecher, Daniel', 'Cizek, Alois', 'Jampilek, Josef']","['Pospisilova S', 'Malik I', 'Curillova J', 'Michnova H', 'Cerna L', 'Padrtova T', 'Hosek J', 'Pecher D', 'Cizek A', 'Jampilek J']","['Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials, Faculty of Science, Palacky University, Slechtitelu 27, 783 71 Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Comenius University in Bratislava, Odbojarov 10, 832 32 Bratislava, Slovak Republic.

Adult AML patients from Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research who received first RIC allo-transplant between 2001 and 2015 were studied. Patients were excluded if they received cord blood or identical twin transplant, total body irradiation in conditioning, or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with in vitro T-cell depletion. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS), secondary end points were leukemia-free survival (LFS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, and GVHD. Multivariate survival model was used with adjustment for patient, leukemia, and transplant-related factors. A total of 622 patients received FM and 791 received FB RIC. Compared with FB, the FM group had fewer transplant in complete remission (CR), fewer matched sibling donors, and less usage of anti-thymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab. More patients in the FM group received marrow grafts and had transplantation before 2005. OS was significantly lower within the first 3 months posttransplant in the FM group (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.82, P < .001), but was marginally superior beyond 3 months (HR = 0.87, P = .05). LFS was better with FM compared with FB (HR = 0.89, P = .05). NRM was significantly increased in the FM group during the first 3 months of posttransplant (HR = 3.85, P < .001). Long-term relapse was lower with FM (HR = 0.65, P < .001). Analysis restricted to patients with CR showed comparable results. In conclusion, compared with FB, the FM RIC showed a marginally superior long-term OS and LFS and a lower relapse rate. A lower OS early posttransplant within 3 months was largely the result of a higher early NRM.","['Zhou, Zheng', 'Nath, Rajneesh', 'Cerny, Jan', 'Wang, Hai-Lin', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham',

In this article we propose an equity-relevant health metric, Health Adjusted Age at Death (HAAD), that facilitates comparison of lifetime health for individuals at the onset of different medical conditions, and allows for the assessment of which patient groups are worse off. A method for estimating HAAD is presented, and we use this method to rank four conditions in six countries according to several criteria of ""worse off"" as a proof of concept. METHODS: For individuals with specific conditions HAAD consists of two components: past health (before disease onset) and future expected health (after disease onset). Four conditions (acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), schizophrenia, and epilepsy) are analysed in six countries (Ethiopia, Haiti, China, Mexico, United States and Japan). Data from 2017 for all countries and for all diseases were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study database. In order to assess who are the worse off, we focus on four measures: the proportion of affected individuals who are expected to have HAAD<20 (T20), the 25th and 75th percentiles of HAAD for affected individuals (Q1 and Q3, respectively), and the average HAAD (aHAAD) across all affected individuals. RESULTS: Even in settings where aHAAD is similar for two conditions, other measures may vary. One example is AML (aHAAD = 59.3, T20 = 2.0%, Q3-Q1 = 14.8) and ALL (58.4, T20 = 4.6%, Q3-Q1 = 21.8) in the US. Many illnesses, such as epilepsy, are associated with more lifetime health in high-income settings (Q1 in Japan = 59.2) than in low-income settings (Q1 in Ethiopia = 26.3). CONCLUSION: Using HAAD we may estimate the distribution of lifetime health of all individuals in a population, and this distribution can be incorporated as an equity consideration in setting priorities for health interventions.","['Johansson, Kjell Arne', 'Okland, Jan-Magnus', 'Skaftun, Eirin Kruger', 'Bukhman, Gene', 'Norheim, Ole Frithjof', 'Coates, Matthew M', 'Haaland, Oystein Ariansen']","['Johansson KA', 'Okland JM', 'Skaftun EK', 'Bukhman G', 'Norheim OF', 'Coates MM', 'Haaland OA']","['Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, Bergen Centre for Ethics and Priority Setting (BCEPS), University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Addiction Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, Bergen Centre for Ethics and Priority Setting (BCEPS), University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, Bergen Centre for Ethics and Priority Setting (BCEPS), University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Program in Global NCDs and Social Change, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, Bergen Centre for Ethics and Priority Setting (BCEPS), University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Harvard T.

However, the role of DAXX in breast cancer development and progression remains elusive. In this study, we examined the expression patterns and function of DAXX in human breast cancer samples and cell lines. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the expression and localization patterns of DAXX. Additionally, we investigated whether DAXX played an intrinsic role in the cellular response to damage induced by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (isolated at M D Anderson from a pleural effusion of a patient with invasive ductal carcinoma). RESULTS: Our results showed that nucleus size, chromatin organization, and DAXX localization were altered in breast cancer tissues compared with those in control tissues. Compared with cytoplasmic and nuclear expression in benign breast tissues, DAXX was colocalized with promyelocytic leukemia in nuclei with a granular distribution. Endogenous DAXX messenger ribonucleic acid levels were upregulated upon UV radiation in MDA-MB-231 cells. DAXX-deficient cells tended to be more sensitive to irradiation than control cells. Conversely, DAXX-overexpressing cells exhibited reduced phosphorylated histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX) accumulation, increased cell survival, and resistance to UV-induced damage. The protective effects of DAXX may be related to the activation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-checkpoint kinase 2 (ATM-CHK2)-cell division cycle 25c (CDC25c) signaling pathways in Gap2/Mitosis (G2/M) checkpoint and ultimately cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggested that DAXX may be an essential component in breast cancer initiation, malignant progression, and radioresistance.","['Shan, Zhiyan', 'Liu, Li', 'Shen, Jingling', 'Hao, Haiyue', 'Zhang, Honghong', 'Lei, Lei', 'Liu, Feng', 'Wang, Zhipeng']","['Shan Z', 'Liu L', 'Shen J', 'Hao H', 'Zhang H', 'Lei L', 'Liu F', 'Wang Z']","['Department of Histology and Embryology, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Both the authors contributed equally to this article.', 'Institute of Life Science, Wenzhou University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China.', 'Both the authors contributed equally to this article.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Oncology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Blood Transfusion Department of Sunshine Union Hospital, Weifang, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Oncology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,,IM,"['Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'Death Domain/*genetics', 'Female', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Middle Aged']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DAXX', '*apoptosis', '*breast cancer', '*cell cycle', '*proliferation']",2020/07/15 06:00,2021/07/10 06:00,['2020/07/15 06:00'],"['2020/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/0963689720920277 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Transplant. 2020 Jan-Dec;29:963689720920277. doi: 10.1177/0963689720920277.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9921-0803'],,,,,PMC7586275,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this method, the target blast cells are double sorted with immunomagnetic beads and captured by the 3rd antibody immobilized on the gold surface in a microfluidic chip. The captured blast cells in the chip were imaged using a bright-field optical microscope and images were analyzed to quantify the cells. First sorting was performed with nano size immunomagnetic beads and followed by 2nd sorting where micron size immunomagnetic beads were used. The low-cost microfluidic platform is made of PMMA and glass including micro size gold pads. The developed microfluidic platform was optimized with cultured B type lymphoblast cells and tested with the samples of leukemia patients. The 8 bone marrow samples of 4 leukemia patients on the initial diagnosis and on the 15th day after the start of the chemotherapy treatment were tested both with the developed microfluidic platform and the flow cytometry. A 99% statistical agreement between the two methods shows that the microfluidic chip is able to monitor the decrease in the number of blast cells due to the chemotherapy.

Twenty-nine alleles were observed in five Kostroma samples, and 14 of them proved unique in comparison with two Yaroslavl samples, in which 25 alleles were detected, and 10 of them were unique. The total frequency of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) resistance alleles (*11, *23, and *28) was 23.2% in the Kostroma, while the total frequency of BLV susceptibility alleles (*8, *16, *22, *24) was low, 8.4%. The frequencies were 25.8 and 30.1%, respectively, in Yaroslavl cattle. Testing Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium revealed a significant deficit of heterozygotes: the observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosities were, respectively, 0.734 and 0.859 in Kostroma cattle and 0.613 and 0.886 in Yaroslavl cattle.

The Bayesian clustering approach showed an intrabreed structure for each of the breeds, with the most probable number of clusters being 2 in the Kostroma and 3 in the Yaroslavl.

We previously cloned STAP-2 as a c-Fms interacting protein and explored its effects on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) leukemogenesis. STAP-2 binds to BCR-ABL, upregulates BCR-ABL phosphorylation, and activates its downstream molecules. In this study, we evaluated the role of STAP-1, another member of the STAP family, in CML pathogenesis. We found that the expression of STAP-1 is aberrantly upregulated in CML stem cells (LSCs) in patients' bone marrow. Using experimental model mice, deletion of STAP-1 prolonged the survival of CML mice with inducing apoptosis of LSCs. The impaired phosphorylation status of STAT5 by STAP-1 ablation leads to downregulation of antiapoptotic genes, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Interestingly, transcriptome analyses indicated that STAP-1 affects several signaling pathways related to BCR-ABL, JAK2, and PPARgamma. This adapter protein directly binds to not only BCR-ABL, but also STAT5 proteins, showing synergistic effects of STAP-1 inhibition and BCR-ABL or JAK2 tyrosine kinase inhibition. Our results identified STAP-1 as a regulator of CML LSCs and suggested it to be a potential therapeutic target for CML.","['Toda, Jun', 'Ichii, Michiko', 'Oritani, Kenji', 'Shibayama, Hirohiko', 'Tanimura, Akira', 'Saito, Hideaki', 'Yokota, Takafumi', 'Motooka, Daisuke', 'Okuzaki, Daisuke', 'Kitai, Yuichi', 'Muromoto, Ryuta', 'Kashiwakura, Jun-Ichi', 'Matsuda, Tadashi', 'Hosen, Naoki', 'Kanakura, Yuzuru']","['Toda J', 'Ichii M', 'Oritani K', 'Shibayama H', 'Tanimura A', 'Saito H', 'Yokota T', 'Motooka D', 'Okuzaki D', 'Kitai Y', 'Muromoto R', 'Kashiwakura JI', 'Matsuda T', 'Hosen N', 'Kanakura Y']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan. michii@bldon.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical Science, International University of Health and Welfare, Narita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Genome Information Research Center, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', 'Genome Information Research Center, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Sumitomo Hospital, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAP-1 protein, mouse)', '0 (STAP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",,,2020/07/15 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/07/15 06:00'],"['2019/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-020-01387-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-020-01387-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2020 Aug;39(34):5601-5615. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-01387-9.

Some copy number variations (CNV), associated with novel subtypes of childhood B-ALL, have prognostic significance. A total of 233 childhood B-ALL patients were enrolled into this study. Focal copy number alterations of ERG, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, RB1, BTG1, EBF1, CDKN2A/2B, and the Xp22.33/Yp11.31 region were assessed by Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). The MLPA telomere kit was used to identify aneuploidy through detection of whole chromosome loss or gain. We carried out these procedures alongside measurement of DNA index in order to identify, aneuploidy status in our cohort. MLPA telomere data and DNA index correlated well with aneuploidy status at higher sensitivity than cytogenetic analysis. Three masked hypodiploid patients, undetected by cytogenetics, and their associated copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) were identified by STR and SNP arrays. Rearrangements of TCF3, located to 19p, were frequently associated with 19p deletions. Other genetic alterations including iAMP21, IKZF1 deletions, ERG deletions, PAX5(AMP), which have clinical significance or are associated with novel subtypes of ALL, were identified. In conclusion, appropriate application of MLPA aids the identifications of CNV and aneuploidy in childhood B-ALL.","['Yu, Chih-Hsiang', 'Lin, Tze-Kang', 'Jou, Shiann-Tarng', 'Lin, Chien-Yu', 'Lin, Kai-Hsin', 'Lu, Meng-Yao', 'Chen, Shu-Huey', 'Cheng, Chao-Neng', 'Wu, Kang-Hsi', 'Wang, Shih-Chung', 'Chang, Hsiu-Hao', 'Li, Meng-Ju', 'Ni, Yu-Ling', 'Su, Yi-Ning', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn', 'Chen, Hsuan-Yu', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Hung, Chia-Cheng', 'Lin, Shu-Wha', 'Yang, Yung-Li']","['Yu CH', 'Lin TK', 'Jou ST', 'Lin CY', 'Lin KH', 'Lu MY', 'Chen SH', 'Cheng CN', 'Wu KH', 'Wang SC', 'Chang HH', 'Li MJ', 'Ni YL', 'Su YN', 'Lin DT', 'Chen HY', 'Harrison CJ', 'Hung CC', 'Lin SW', 'Yang YL']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Sofiva Genomics Co., Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Statistical Science Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, China Medical University Children's Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Sofiva Genomics Co., Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Statistical Science Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Sofiva Genomics Co., Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan. double@sofivagenomics.com.tw.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. mtshuwha@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan. yangyl92@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. yangyl92@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan. yangyl92@ntu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aneuploidy', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA Copy Number Variations/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Pathology, Molecular', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/genetics/pathology', '*Prognosis']",,,2020/07/15 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/07/15 06:00'],"['2019/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-68311-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-68311-9 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jul 13;10(1):11501. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-68311-9.,,20200713,,,,PMC7359332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To enable NK cells with these capabilities, we created and have previously described a tri-specific killer engager (TriKE) platform capable of inducing antigen specificity and cytokine-mediated NK-cell expansion. TriKE molecules have three arms: (i) a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against the activating receptor CD16 on NK cells to trigger NK-cell activation, (ii) an scFv against a tumor-associated antigen (CD33 here) to induce specific tumor target recognition, and (iii) an IL15 moiety to trigger NK-cell expansion and priming. Here, we demonstrate that by modifying the anti-CD16 scFv with a humanized single-domain antibody against CD16, we improved TriKE functionality. A CD33-targeting second-generation TriKE induced stronger and more specific NK-cell proliferation without T-cell stimulation, enhanced in vitro NK-cell activation and killing of CD33-expressing targets, and improved tumor control in preclinical mouse models. Given these improved functional characteristics, we propose rapid translation of second-generation TriKEs into the clinic.","['Felices, Martin', 'Lenvik, Todd R', 'Kodal, Behiye', 'Lenvik, Alexander J', 'Hinderlie, Peter', 'Bendzick, Laura E', 'Schirm, Dawn K', 'Kaminski, Michael F', 'McElmurry, Ron T', 'Geller, Melissa A', 'Eckfeldt, Craig E', 'Vallera, Daniel A', 'Miller, Jeffrey S']","['Felices M', 'Lenvik TR', 'Kodal B', 'Lenvik AJ', 'Hinderlie P', 'Bendzick LE', 'Schirm DK', 'Kaminski MF', 'McElmurry RT', 'Geller MA', 'Eckfeldt CE', 'Vallera DA', 'Miller JS']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', ""Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota."", 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', ""Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Women's Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota."", 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota. mille011@umn.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Immunol Res,Cancer immunology research,101614637,['0 (Interleukin-15)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-15/*administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/*transplantation', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2020/07/15 06:00,2021/08/26 06:00,['2020/07/15 06:00'],"['2019/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['2326-6066.CIR-19-0837 [pii]', '10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-19-0837 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Res. 2020 Sep;8(9):1139-1149. doi: 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-19-0837.

We aimed to analyze the effect of distance traveled on overall survival (OS) of AML patients treated at an academic center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: AML patients diagnosed at the University of Nebraska Medical Center were divided into 4 groups according to the shortest distance between the cancer center and patients' residence (<25, 25-50, 50-100, and > 100 miles). Chi-square test and ANOVA were used to examine the association of distance with patient characteristics. OS, defined as the time from diagnosis of AML to death from any cause, was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison of survival curves was done by the log-rank test. Multivariable analysis using Cox regression was performed to detect the survival effect of distance from the cancer center. RESULTS: The total number of patients was 449. Median distance was 85 miles (interquartile range, 20-180). OS at 1 year for < 25, 25-50, 50-100, and > 100 miles was 45%, 55%, 38%, and 40% respectively (P = .6). In a Cox regression analysis, distance from treatment center, as a continuous variable, was not a significant factor for death (hazard ratio, 1.001; 95% confidence interval, 1.000-1.001). Multivariable analysis showed nonsignificant trend of increased mortality for patients traveling > 100 miles to a cancer center. CONCLUSION: This study did not demonstrate an association between distance from an academic cancer center and OS in AML. This finding should provide some assurance to patients who live farther away from academic centers.","['Dhakal, Prajwal', 'Lyden, Elizabeth', 'Muir, Kate-Lynn E', 'Al-Kadhimi, Zaid S', 'Maness, Lori J', 'Gundabolu, Krishna', 'Bhatt, Vijaya Raj']","['Dhakal P', 'Lyden E', 'Muir KE', 'Al-Kadhimi ZS', 'Maness LJ', 'Gundabolu K', 'Bhatt VR']","['Division of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE; Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.

Several studies show that somatic mutations in the TP53 gene are present in up to 50% of patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This study aims to review and compare the methods used to detect somatic TP53 mutations and/or 17p deletions and analyze their importance in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia diagnosis and follow-up. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with refractory or recurrent disease, the probability of clonal expansion of cells with the TP53 mutation and/or 17p deletion is very high. The studies assessed showed several methodologies able to detect these changes. For the 17p deletion, the chromosome G-banding (karyotype) and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization are the most sensitive. For somatic mutations involving the TP53 gene, moderate or high-coverage read next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing are the most recommended ones. The TP53 gene mutations represent a strong adverse prognostic factor for patient survival and treatment resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Patients carrying low-proportion TP53 mutation (less than 20-25% of all alleles) remain a challenge to these tests. Thus, for any of the methods employed, it is essential that the laboratory conduct its analytical validation, documenting its accuracy, precision and sensitivity/limit of detection.","['Chauffaille, Maria de Lourdes L F', 'Zalcberg, Ilana', 'Barreto, Wolney Gois', 'Bendit, Israel']","['Chauffaille MLLF', 'Zalcberg I', 'Barreto WG', 'Bendit I']","['Grupo Fleury, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.

Since then, numerous preclinical studies have confirmed the oncolytic activity of MeV vaccine strains as well as their potential to promote long-lasting tumor-specific immune responses. Early clinical data indicate that some of these effects may translate to the treatment of cancer patients. In this review, we provide a structured summary of current evidence for the anti-tumor immune activity of oncolytic MeV. We start with an overview of MeV oncolysis and MeV-induced immunogenic cell death. Next, we relate findings on MeV-mediated activation of antigen-presenting cells, T cell priming and effector mechanisms to the cancer immunity cycle. We discuss additional factors in the tumor microenvironment which are modulated by MeV treatment as well as the role of anti-viral immunity. Based on these findings, we highlight avenues for rational enhancement of oncolytic MeV immunotherapy by vector engineering. We further point to advantages and drawbacks of experimental models and propose areas warranting promising research. Lastly, we review the available immunomonitoring data from several Phase I clinical trials. While this review presents data for MeV, the concepts and principles introduced herein apply to other oncolytic viruses, providing a framework to assess novel cancer immunotherapies.","['Pidelaserra-Marti, Gemma', 'Engeland, Christine E']","['Pidelaserra-Marti G', 'Engeland CE']","['Research Group Mechanisms of Oncolytic Immunotherapy, Clinical Cooperation Unit Virotherapy, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) and National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Heidelberg, Germany; Faculty of Biosciences, Heidelberg University and Helmholtz International Graduate School for Cancer Research, DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany.

The concept was strengthened by the discovery of the other activating driver mutations in MPL (thrombopoietin receptor, TpoR) and in calreticulin gene, which all lead to persistent activation of wild type JAK2. Although with a rare frequency, MPNs can evolve to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML), a condition that is resistant to treatment. Here we focus on the role of p53 in this transition. In sAML mutations in TP53 or amplification in genes coding for negative regulators of p53 are much more frequent than in de novo AML. We review studies that explore a signaling and biochemical interaction between activated STATs and p53 in MPNs and other cancers. With the development of advanced sequencing efforts, strong evidence has been presented for dominant negative effects of mutated p53 in leukemia. In other studies, gain of function effects have been described that might be cell type specific. A more profound understanding of the potential interaction between p53 and activated STATs is necessary in order to take full advantage of novel p53-targeted therapies.","['Goyal, Harsh', 'Chachoua, Ilyas', 'Pecquet, Christian', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Constantinescu, Stefan N']","['Goyal H', 'Chachoua I', 'Pecquet C', 'Vainchenker W', 'Constantinescu SN']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Brussels, Brussels, Belgium; Universite catholique de Louvain and de Duve Institute, Brussels, Belgium; WELBIO (Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Brussels, Brussels, Belgium; Universite catholique de Louvain and de Duve Institute, Brussels, Belgium; Karolinska Institutet, Department of Oncology-Pathology, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Brussels, Brussels, Belgium; Universite catholique de Louvain and de Duve Institute, Brussels, Belgium; WELBIO (Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology), Brussels, Belgium.', 'INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche 1170, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Paris-Saclay, Unite Mixte de Recherche 1170, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Gustave Roussy, Unite Mixte de Recherche 1170, Villejuif, France.', 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Brussels, Brussels, Belgium; Universite catholique de Louvain and de Duve Institute, Brussels, Belgium; WELBIO (Walloon Excellence in Life Sciences and Biotechnology), Brussels, Belgium.

Additionally, restoration or depletion of several miRNAs has been observed in multiple cancer types including gastric cancer (GC). In this present study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism of miR-130b-3p in M2 macrophage-derived EVs in the development of GC through regulation of mixed lineage leukemia 3 (MLL3) and grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2). METHODS: Expression of miR-130b-3p and GRHL2 was quantified in 63 pairs of cancerous and noncancerous gastric tissues. The predicted binding between miR-130b-3p and MLL3, together with the enrichment of MLL3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac in gene enhancer region, was verified by luciferase activity assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Effects of miR-130b-3p on GC cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion, as well as tube formation of human umbilical endothelial vein cells (HUEVCs) were further determined by gain- and loss-of function assays in vitro. RESULTS: miR-130b-3p was upregulated in GC tissues, and miR-130b-3p promoted survival, metastasis and angiogenesis of GC cells as well as enhanced tumor formation and angiogenesis in GC in vivo. Additionally, miR-130b-3p delivered in M2 macrophage-derived EVs promoted survival, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of GC cells. Notably, MLL3 inhibited GC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and vessel-like tube formation of HUEVCs by increasing GRHL2.

As a representative damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), HMGB1 normally exists inside cells but can be secreted into the extracellular environment through passive or active release. Extracellular HMGB1 binds with several different receptors and interactors to mediate the proliferation, differentiation, mobilization, and senescence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HMGB1 is also involved in the formation of the inflammatory bone marrow (BM) microenvironment by activating proinflammatory signaling pathways. Moreover, HMGB1-dependent autophagy induces chemotherapy resistance in leukemia and multiple myeloma. In this review, we systematically summarize the emerging roles of HMGB1 in carcinogenesis, progression, prognosis, and potential clinical applications in different hematopoietic malignancies. In summary, targeting the regulation of HMGB1 activity in HSCs and the BM microenvironment is highly beneficial in the diagnosis and treatment of various hematopoietic malignancies.","['Yuan, Shunling', 'Liu, Zhaoping', 'Xu, Zhenru', 'Liu, Jing', 'Zhang, Ji']","['Yuan S', 'Liu Z', 'Xu Z', 'Liu J', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Hunan Province Key Laboratory of Basic and Applied Hematology, Molecular Biology Research Center & Center for Medical Genetics, School of Life Sciences, Central South University, Changsha, 410078, Hunan, China. jingliucsu@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, 421001, Hunan, China. zhang_ji001@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (HMGB1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Autophagy', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Extracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'HMGB1 Protein/chemistry/immunology/*physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*metabolism/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/metabolism/therapy', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/metabolism/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/metabolism/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/metabolism/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/immunology/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow (BM) microenvironment', '*Chemoresistance', '*Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)', '*High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)', '*Inflammation']",2020/07/15 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2020/07/15 06:00'],"['2020/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-020-00920-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-020-00920-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2020 Jul 13;13(1):91. doi: 10.1186/s13045-020-00920-3.,,20200713,,,,PMC7359022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently identified a strong correlation between impaired neutrophil motility and the disease stage of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Here, we apply this assay to study quantitively increased neutrophils of a patient suffering from a rare leukemia subtype, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML). METHODS: A 69-year-old male was analyzed in this study. Besides routine analyses, we purified the patient's neutrophils from peripheral whole blood and studied their migration behavior using time-lapse video microscopy in a standardized assay. These live cell migration analyses also allowed for the quantification of cell morphology. Furthermore, the cells were stained for the markers CD15, CD16, fMLPR, CXCR1 and CXCR2. RESULTS: Despite cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea, the patient's WBC and ANC were poorly controlled and severe dysgranulopoiesis with hypogranularity was observed. Neutrophils displayed strongly impaired migration when compared to healthy controls and migrating cells exhibited a more flattened-out morphology than control neutrophils. Because of a detected CSF3R (p.T618I) mutation and constitutional symptoms treatment with ruxolitinib was initiated. Within 1 week of ruxolitinib treatment, the cell shape normalized and remained indistinguishable from healthy control neutrophils. However, neutrophil migration did not improve over the course of ruxolitinib therapy but was strikingly altered shortly before a sinusitis with fever and bleeding from a gastric ulcer. Molecular work-up revealed that under ruxolitinib treatment, the CSF3R clone was depleted, yet the expansion of a NRAS mutated subclone was promoted. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the usefulness of neutrophil migration analyses to uncover corresponding alterations of neutrophil migration in rare myeloid neoplasms. Furthermore, in addition to monitoring migration the determination of morphological features of live neutrophils might represent a useful tool to monitor the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches.","['Bornemann, Lea', 'Schuster, Marc', 'Schmitz, Saskia', 'Sobczak, Charlyn', 'Bessen, Clara', 'Merz, Simon F', 'Jockel, Karl-Heinz', 'Haverkamp, Thomas', 'Gunzer, Matthias', 'Gothert, Joachim R']","['Bornemann L', 'Schuster M', 'Schmitz S', 'Sobczak C', 'Bessen C', 'Merz SF', 'Jockel KH', 'Haverkamp T', 'Gunzer M', 'Gothert JR']","['Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital, University Duisburg-Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Present address: Miltenyi Biotec B.V. & Co.

The colony forming ability test was applied for survival and the MTT test for viability determination after X-irradiation. Cell cycle progression was determined by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells, and DNA double strand break (DSB) induction and repair by gammaH2AX immunofluorescence. The radiosensitivity of mESCs was slightly higher compared to the murine osteoblast cell line OCT-1. The viability 72 h after X-irradiation decreased dose-dependently and was higher in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Cells exposed to 2 or 7 Gy underwent a transient G2 arrest. X-irradiation induced gammaH2AX foci and they disappeared within 72 h. After 72 h of X-ray exposure, RNA was isolated and analyzed using genome-wide microarrays. The gene expression analysis revealed amongst others a regulation of developmental genes (Ada, Baz1a, Calcoco2, Htra1, Nefh, S100a6 and Rassf6), downregulation of genes involved in glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism whereas upregulation of genes related to the p53 signaling pathway. X-irradiated mESCs formed EBs and differentiated toward cardiomyocytes but their beating frequencies were lower compared to EBs from unirradiated cells. These results suggest that X-irradiation of mESCs deregulate genes related to the developmental process. The most significant biological processes found to be altered by X-irradiation in mESCs were the development of cardiovascular, nervous, circulatory and renal system. These results may explain the X-irradiation induced-embryonic lethality and malformations observed in animal studies.","['Hellweg, Christine E', 'Shinde, Vaibhav', 'Srinivasan, Sureshkumar Perumal', 'Henry, Margit', 'Rotshteyn, Tamara', 'Baumstark-Khan, Christa', 'Schmitz, Claudia', 'Feles, Sebastian', 'Spitta, Luis F', 'Hemmersbach, Ruth', 'Hescheler, Jurgen', 'Sachinidis, Agapios']","['Hellweg CE', 'Shinde V', 'Srinivasan SP', 'Henry M', 'Rotshteyn T', 'Baumstark-Khan C', 'Schmitz C', 'Feles S', 'Spitta LF', 'Hemmersbach R', 'Hescheler J', 'Sachinidis A']","['German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Radiation Biology, Linder Hohe, D-51147 Koln, Germany.', 'Curadev Pharma Pvt.Ltd., B87, Sector 83, Noida, UP 201305, India.', 'Curadev Pharma Pvt.Ltd., B87, Sector 83, Noida, UP 201305, India.', 'Institute of Neurophysiology and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Robert-Koch-Str. 39, 50931 Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Neurophysiology and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Robert-Koch-Str. 39, 50931 Cologne, Germany.', 'German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Radiation Biology, Linder Hohe, D-51147 Koln, Germany.', 'German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Radiation Biology, Linder Hohe, D-51147 Koln, Germany.', 'German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Radiation Biology, Linder Hohe, D-51147 Koln, Germany.', 'German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Gravitational Biology, Linder Hohe, D-51147 Koln, Germany.', 'German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Radiation Biology, Linder Hohe, D-51147 Koln, Germany.', 'German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Gravitational Biology, Linder Hohe, D-51147 Koln, Germany.', 'Institute of Neurophysiology and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Robert-Koch-Str. 39, 50931 Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Neurophysiology and Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Robert-Koch-Str. 39, 50931 Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'Mice', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/cytology', 'Transcriptome', 'X-Rays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes', '*cell cycle', '*cell death', '*cell viability', '*embryonic stem cells', '*gene expression', '*gene ontology', '*radiation']",2020/07/15 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/07/15 06:00'],"['2020/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9071650 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9071650 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Jul 9;9(7). pii: cells9071650. doi: 10.3390/cells9071650.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2223-3580', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3054-225X']",20200709,,,,PMC7408589,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, high response rates are heterogeneous due to different mechanisms mediating resistance to venetoclax such as up-regulation of MCL-1 expression. We thus tested the anti-leukemic activity of S63845, a specific MCL-1 inhibitor. METHODS: Apoptosis induces by S63845 with or without venetoclax was evaluated in primary AML samples and in AML cell lines co-cultured or not with bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stromal cells. Sensitivity of leukemic cells to S63845 was correlated to the expression level of BCL-2, MCL-1, and BCL-XL determined by Western Blot and mass spectrometry-based proteomics. RESULTS: We observed that even if MCL-1 expression is weak compared to BCL-2, S63845 induces apoptosis of AML cells and strongly synergizes with venetoclax. Furthermore, AML cells resistant to venetoclax are highly sensitive to S63845. Interestingly, the synergistic effect of S63845 toward venetoclax-mediated apoptosis of AML cells is still observed in a context of interaction with the BM microenvironment that intrinsically mediates resistance to BCL2 inhibition. CONCLUSION: These results are therefore of great relevance for clinicians as they provide the rational for combining BCL-2 and MCL-1 inhibition in AML.","['Hormi, Myriam', 'Birsen, Rudy', 'Belhadj, Maya', 'Huynh, Tony', 'Cantero Aguilar, Lilia', 'Grignano, Eric', 'Haddaoui, Lamya', 'Guillonneau, Francois', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Hunault, Mathilde', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Kosmider, Olivier', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Bouscary, Didier', 'Chapuis, Nicolas']","['Hormi M', 'Birsen R', 'Belhadj M', 'Huynh T', 'Cantero Aguilar L', 'Grignano E', 'Haddaoui L', 'Guillonneau F', 'Mayeux P', 'Hunault M', 'Tamburini J', 'Kosmider O', 'Fontenay M', 'Bouscary D', 'Chapuis N']","['Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'FILOtheque, Hopital La Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', 'Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Service des Maladies du Sang, Centre hospitalo-universitaire, Angers, France.', ""CRCINA, INSERM Universite de Nantes, Universite d'Angers, Angers, France."", 'Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris.Centre - Universite de Paris, Service d'Hematologie clinique, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France."", 'Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris.Centre - Universite de Paris, Service d'Hematologie biologique, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France."", 'Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris.Centre - Universite de Paris, Service d'Hematologie biologique, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France."", 'Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris.Centre - Universite de Paris, Service d'Hematologie clinique, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France."", 'Institut Cochin, CNRS UMR8104, INSERM U1016, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris.Centre - Universite de Paris, Service d'Hematologie biologique, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (S63845)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Thiophenes)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'MCL-1', 'S63845', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'venetoclax (ABT-199)']",2020/07/14 06:00,2021/07/30 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13492 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 Nov;105(5):588-596. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13492.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Outcomes were compared in retrospect between r/r patients treated with HDMP (n = 20), ibrutinib (n = 39) and idelalisib with rituximab (n = 14). RESULTS: Higher overall response rates were found in those patients undergoing BCRi therapy compared to HDMP (79.2% vs. 0%; p < 0.0001), along with longer median progression-free survival (not reached vs. 24.1 months; p < 0.01). Nevertheless, there were no differences in the overall survival (HDMP 35.87 months vs. not reached; p = 0.58). CONCLUSION: HDMP treatment was significantly inferior in terms of response rate and progression-free survival in r/r CLL/SLL patients with the 17p deletion, and may only be used whenever novel compounds are unavailable.","['Pula, Bartosz', 'Dlugosz-Danecka, Monika', 'Salomon-Perzynski, Aleksander', 'Szymczyk, Agnieszka', 'Subocz, Edyta', 'Budziszewska, Bozena Katarzyna', 'Rybka, Justyna', 'Gil, Lidia', 'Waszczuk-Gajda, Anna', 'Iskierka-Jazdzewska, Elzbieta', 'Zaucha, Jan M', 'Osowiecki, Michal', 'Piszczek, Weronika', 'Steckiewicz, Pawel', 'Szukalski, Lukasz', 'Hus, Marek', 'Lech-Maranda, Ewa', 'Jurczak, Wojciech', 'Jamroziak, Krzysztof']","['Pula B', 'Dlugosz-Danecka M', 'Salomon-Perzynski A', 'Szymczyk A', 'Subocz E', 'Budziszewska BK', 'Rybka J', 'Gil L', 'Waszczuk-Gajda A', 'Iskierka-Jazdzewska E', 'Zaucha JM', 'Osowiecki M', 'Piszczek W', 'Steckiewicz P', 'Szukalski L', 'Hus M', 'Lech-Maranda E', 'Jurczak W', 'Jamroziak K']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.

It possesses valuable pharmacological properties, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-cancer activities. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies investigated the anticancer profile of CA and emphasized its potentiality for cancer treatment. Nevertheless, the role of multidrug-resistance (MDR) related mechanisms for CA's anticancer effect is not yet known. PURPOSE: We investigated the cytotoxicity of CA against known mechanisms of anticancer drug resistance (P-gp, ABCB5, BCRP, EGFR and p53) and determined novel putative molecular factors associated with cellular response towards CA. STUDY DESIGN: Cytotoxicity assays, bioinformatic analysis, flow cytometry and western blotting were performed to identify the mode of action of CA towards cancer cells. METHODS: The cytotoxicity to CA was assessed using the resazurin assays in cell lines expressing the mentioned resistance mechanisms. A pharmacogenomic characterization of the NCI 60 cell line panel was applied via COMPARE, hierarchical cluster and network analyses. Flow cytometry was used to detect cellular mode of death and ROS generation. Changes in proteins-related to apoptosis were determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: Cell lines expressing ABC transporters (P-gp, BCRP or ABCB5), mutant EGFR or p53 were not cross-resistant to CA compared to their parental counterparts. By pharmacogenomic approaches, we identified genes that belong to different functional groups (e.g. signal transduction, regulation of cytoskeleton and developmental regulatory system). These genes were predicted as molecular determinants that mediate CA tumor cellular responses. The top affected biofunctions included cellular development, cellular proliferation and cellular death and survival. The effect of CA-mediated apoptosis in leukemia cells, which were recognized as the most sensitive tumor type, was confirmed via flow cytometry and western blot analysis. CONCLUSION: CA may provide a novel treatment option to target refractory tumors and to effectively cooperate with established chemotherapy. Using pharmacogenomic approaches and network pharmacology, the relationship between cancer complexity and multi-target potentials of CA was analyzed and many putative molecular determinants were identified. They could serve as novel targets for CA and further studies are needed to translate the possible implications to clinical cancer treatment.","['Mahmoud, Nuha', 'Saeed, Mohamed E M', 'Sugimoto, Yoshikazu', 'Klinger, Anette', 'Fleischer, Edmond', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Mahmoud N', 'Saeed MEM', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Klinger A', 'Fleischer E', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Division of Chemotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'MicroCombiChem GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'MicroCombiChem GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.

The c-Kit tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR) represents a suitable target for the carcinogenesis control of gastro-intestinal stromal (GIST), leukemia, and mastocytosis tumors; nevertheless, several hotspot mutations of the protein limit the efficacy of a few clinical administered TKRs inhibitors. In this study, a new in silico protocol based on ligand and structure-based combined method is proposed, with the aim to identify a set of new c-Kit inhibitors able to complex c-Kit mutated proteins. A recent and freely available web-server DRUDIT is used for the ligand-based method. The protocol application allows for identifying a new generation of potential TKR inhibitors, which, in silico, complex the V654A and T670I mutated proteins and potentially overcome resistant mutations (D816H). The structure-based analysis is performed by Induced Fit Docking (IFD) studies. The comparison between the explored ligands and well-known drugs highlights the possibility to overcome tumor-acquired resistance. The best-selected structures (630705 and SML1348) provide valuable binding affinities with the mutated c-Kit forms (respectively T670I and V654A).","['Martorana, Annamaria', 'Lauria, Antonino']","['Martorana A', 'Lauria A']","['Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Biologiche Chimiche e Farmaceutiche ""STEBICEF"" - University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze - Ed. 17, 90128, Palermo, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Biologiche Chimiche e Farmaceutiche ""STEBICEF"" - University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze - Ed. 17, 90128, Palermo, Italy.

REL is the hematopoietic member of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) family and is frequently amplified in human lymphomas. However, the mechanism through which REL and its encoded protein c-Rel affect human lymphoma is largely unknown. Using both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches, we studied the roles of REL gene in human Jurkat leukemia cells. Compared with control Jurkat cells, REL knockout cells exhibited significant defects in cell growth and mitochondrial respiration. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses revealed that T cells lacking c-Rel had selective defects in the expression of inflammatory and metabolic genes including c-Myc. We found that c-Rel controlled the expression of c-Myc through its promotor, and expressing c-Myc in c-Rel-deficient lymphoma cells rescued their proliferative and metabolic defects. Thus, the human c-Rel-c-Myc axis controls lymphoma growth and metabolism and could be a therapeutic target for lymphomas.","['Li, Xinyuan', 'Luo, George', 'Li, Ting', 'Sun, Honghong', 'Wang, Wei', 'Eiler, Emily', 'Goldsmith, Jason R', 'Chen, Youhai H']","['Li X', 'Luo G', 'Li T', 'Sun H', 'Wang W', 'Eiler E', 'Goldsmith JR', 'Chen YH']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

The IC50 values were very promising: compound [6e = 11.73 (alpha), 6.09 (beta), 11.18 (delta)], compound [6g = 8.43 (alpha), 15.84 (beta), 30.62 (delta)], and compound [6l = 13.98 (alpha), 7.22 (beta), 10.94 (delta)], compared to the reference compound LY294002 = 6.28 (alpha), 4.51 (beta), 4.60 (delta) uM, respectively. Moreover, cell cycle analysis and annexin V-FITC staining were done on Leukemia SR, there was arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis was induced. Finally, docking study was performed to analyze the interactive mode of these derivatives in PI3Kalpha ATP-binding site. These outcomes proved that compounds 6e, 6g, and 6l are potential leads for further optimization as antileukemic agents.","['Helwa, Amira A', 'El-Dydamony, Nehad M', 'Radwan, Rasha A', 'Abdelraouf, Sahar M', 'Abdelnaby, Rana M']","['Helwa AA', 'El-Dydamony NM', 'Radwan RA', 'Abdelraouf SM', 'Abdelnaby RM']","['Pharmaceutical Organic Chemistry Department, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Drug Manufacturing, Misr University for Science and Technology, 6(th) of October City, Egypt.

We analyzed 257 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and fulfilled the following criteria: intermediate- or poor-risk disease by National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines (2017, version 3), in first complete remission (CR1) at SCT, received either myeloablative conditioning (MAC; busulfan plus cyclophosphamide or cyclophosphamide plus total body irradiation) or reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC; FluBu2TBI400) peripheral blood SCT from 8/8 matched sibling or unrelated donor, and having bone marrow Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) expression results before transplant. We and other groups serially published a predictive value for pretransplant WT1 expression in patients with AML to identify patients at higher risk of relapse. Among the total 257 patients, 191 (74.3%) and 66 (25.7%) patients received MAC and RIC transplants, respectively. WT1 >/=250 copies/10(4)ABL was defined as WT1(high). WT1(high) before SCT was found to be an independent prognostic factor for inferior overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR). There were 201 patients with WT1 low expression based upon pretransplant analysis. There was no significant difference in OS, DFS, CIR, and nonrelapse mortality between MAC and RIC patients. To conclude, post-transplant survival or relapse was not different by conditioning intensity in AML CR1 patients whose WT1 level was below 250 copies per 10(4)ABL at transplantation.","['Park, Silvia', 'Min, Gi June', 'Park, Sung Soo', 'Yahng, Seung-Ah', 'Jeon, Young-Woo', 'Shin, Seung-Hwan', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Cho, Byung Sik', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Lee, Jong Wook', 'Kim, Hee-Je']","['Park S', 'Min GJ', 'Park SS', 'Yahng SA', 'Jeon YW', 'Shin SH', 'Yoon JH', 'Lee SE', 'Cho BS', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Min CK', 'Cho SG', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Kim HJ']","[""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Incheon St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Incheon, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Yeoido St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Eunpyeong St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea; Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.

The eraser histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a class IIb histone deacetylase that targets various non-histone proteins such as transcription factors, nuclear receptors, cytoskeletal proteins, DNA repair proteins, and molecular chaperones. Therefore, it became an attractive target for cancer treatment. In this study, virtual screening was applied to the MicroCombiChem database with 1162 drug-like compounds to identify new HDAC6 inhibitors. Five compounds were tested in silico and in vitro as HDAC6 inhibitors. Both analyses revealed 1-cyclohexene-1-carboxamide, 2-hydroxy-4,4-dimethyl-N-1-naphthalenyl-6-oxo- (MCC2344) as the best HDAC6 inhibitor among the five ligands. The binding affinity of MCC2344 to HDAC6 was further confirmed by microscale thermophoresis. Additionally, the anti-cancer activity of MCC2344 was tested in several tumor cell lines. Leukemia cells were the most sensitive cells towards MCC2344, particularly the P-glycoprotein-overexpressing multidrug-resistant cell line CEM/ADR5000 exhibited remarkable collateral sensitivity towards MCC2344. Transcriptome analysis using microarray hybridization was performed for investigating downstream mechanisms of action of MCC2344 in leukemia cells. MCC2344 affected microtubule dynamics and suppressed cell migration in the wound healing assay as well as in a spheroid model by hyper-acetylation of tubulin and HSP-90. MCC2344 induced cell death in CEM/ADR5000 cells by activation of PARP, caspase-3, and p21 in addition to the downregulation of p62. MCC2344 significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo in zebrafish larvae without mortality until 20 pM. We propose MCC2344 as a novel HDAC6 inhibitor for cancer treatment.","['Dawood, Mona', 'Fleischer, Edmond', 'Klinger, Anette', 'Bringmann, Gerhard', 'Shan, Letian', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Dawood M', 'Fleischer E', 'Klinger A', 'Bringmann G', 'Shan L', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany; Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Al-Neelain University, Khartoum, Sudan.', 'MicroCombiChem GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'MicroCombiChem GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, University of Wurzburg, Am Hubland, D-97074, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, 310053, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.

ETV6 fusions function primarily by constitutive activation of kinase activity of the fusion partners, modifications in the normal functions of ETV6 transcription factor, loss of function of ETV6 or the partner gene and activation of a proto-oncogene near the site of translocation. The role of ETV6 fusion gene in tumorigenesis has been well-documented and more variedly found in haematological malignancies. However, the role of the ETV6 oncogene in solid tumors has also risen to prominence due to an increasing number of cases being reported with this malignancy. Since, solid tumors can be well-targeted, the diagnosis of this genre of tumors based on ETV6 malignancy is of crucial importance for treatment. This review highlights the important ETV6 associated fusions in solid tumors along with critical insights as to existing and novel means of targeting it. A consolidation of novel therapies such as immune, gene, RNAi, stem cell therapy and protein degradation hitherto unused in the case of ETV6 solid tumor malignancies may open further therapeutic avenues.","['Biswas, Angana', 'Rajesh, Yetirajam', 'Mitra, Pralay', 'Mandal, Mahitosh']","['Biswas A', 'Rajesh Y', 'Mitra P', 'Mandal M']","['School of Medical Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur 721302, India.', 'Department of Human and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, United States of America.', 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian institute of Technology Kharagpur, Kharagpur 721302, India.

In recent years, increasing evidence have demonstrated that the activation and mutation of FLT3 is closely implicated in the occurrence and development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The exploration of small-molecule inhibitors targeting FLT3 has aroused wide interest of pharmaceutical chemists and is expected to bring new hope for AML therapy. In this review, we specifically highlighted FLT3 mediated JAK/STAT, RAS/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. The structural properties and biological activities of representative FLT3 inhibitors reported from 2014 to the present were also summarized. In addition, the major challenges in the current advance of novel FLT3 inhibitors were further analyzed, with the aim to guide future drug discovery.","['Zhong, Yue', 'Qiu, Run-Ze', 'Sun, Shan-Liang', 'Zhao, Chao', 'Fan, Tian-Yuan', 'Chen, Min', 'Li, Nian-Guang', 'Shi, Zhi-Hao']","['Zhong Y', 'Qiu RZ', 'Sun SL', 'Zhao C', 'Fan TY', 'Chen M', 'Li NG', 'Shi ZH']","['National and Local Collaborative Engineering Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization and Formulae Innovative Medicine, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China.', 'National and Local Collaborative Engineering Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization and Formulae Innovative Medicine, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China.', 'National and Local Collaborative Engineering Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization and Formulae Innovative Medicine, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China.', 'National and Local Collaborative Engineering Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization and Formulae Innovative Medicine, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China.', 'National and Local Collaborative Engineering Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization and Formulae Innovative Medicine, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China.', 'National and Local Collaborative Engineering Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization and Formulae Innovative Medicine, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China.', 'National and Local Collaborative Engineering Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization and Formulae Innovative Medicine, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for High Technology Research of TCM Formulae, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Indoles/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Urea/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,2020/07/14 06:00,2020/12/29 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00696 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2020 Nov 12;63(21):12403-12428. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00696.

For pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), response to GCs remains the most reliable prognostic indicator; failure to respond to GC correlates with poor event-free survival. To uncover GC resistance mechanisms, we performed a genome-wide, survival-based short hairpin RNA screen and identified the orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor-beta (ESRRB) as a critical transcription factor that cooperates with the GC receptor (GR) to mediate the GC gene expression signature in mouse and human ALL cells. Esrrb knockdown interfered with the expression of genes that were induced and repressed by GR and resulted in GC resistance in vitro and in vivo. Dexamethasone treatment stimulated ESRRB binding to estrogen-related receptor elements (ERREs) in canonical GC-regulated genes, and H3K27Ac Hi-chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed increased interactions between GR- and ERRE-containing regulatory regions in dexamethasone-treated human T-ALL cells. Furthermore, ESRRB agonists enhanced GC target gene expression and synergized with dexamethasone to induce leukemic cell death, indicating that ESRRB agonists may overcome GC resistance in ALL, and potentially, in other lymphoid malignancies.","['Gallagher, Kayleigh M', 'Roderick, Justine E', 'Tan, Shi Hao', 'Tan, Tze King', 'Murphy, Leonard', 'Yu, Jun', 'Li, Rui', ""O'Connor, Kevin W"", 'Zhu, Julie', 'Green, Michael R', 'Sanda, Takaomi', 'Kelliher, Michelle A']","['Gallagher KM', 'Roderick JE', 'Tan SH', 'Tan TK', 'Murphy L', 'Yu J', 'Li R', ""O'Connor KW"", 'Zhu J', 'Green MR', 'Sanda T', 'Kelliher MA']","['Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, Center of Translational Medicine, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, Center of Translational Medicine, Singapore.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, Center of Translational Medicine, Singapore.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (ESRRB protein, human)', '0 (Esrrb protein, mouse)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Gene Expression', '*Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics']",,,2020/07/14 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31645-1 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001555 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Jul 14;4(13):3154-3168. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2020001555.,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['F30 CA257270/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA130807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM107000/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7362368,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report enhanced levels of SUMOylated IE1 in the presence of PML and have identified a putative SUMO Interacting Motif (SIM) within IE1, essential for its nuclear distribution, overall SUMOylation and association with PML to nuclear bodies. Furthermore, using PML knockout cell lines we made the original observation that PML is required for efficient HHV-6B integration into host chromosomes. Taken together, we could demonstrate that PML-NBs are important for IE1 multiSUMOylation and that PML plays an important role in HHV-6B integration into chromosomes, a strategy developed by this virus to maintain its genome in its host over long periods of time.","['Collin, Vanessa', 'Gravel, Annie', 'Kaufer, Benedikt B', 'Flamand, Louis']","['Collin V', 'Gravel A', 'Kaufer BB', 'Flamand L']","['Division of Infectious Disease and Immunity, CHU de Quebec Research Center, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Infectious Disease and Immunity, CHU de Quebec Research Center, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institut fur Virologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Division of Infectious Disease and Immunity, CHU de Quebec Research Center, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of microbiology, infectious disease and immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (immediate-early 1 protein, human herpesvirus 6)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Roseolovirus Infections/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Telomere/*virology', 'Virus Latency/genetics']",,,2020/07/14 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1008683 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-20-00875 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2020 Jul 13;16(7):e1008683. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008683. eCollection 2020 Jul.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5229-5750', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5010-4586']",20200713,,,"['MOP_123214 /CIHR/Canada', 'PJT_156118/CIHR/Canada']",PMC7394443,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found that CaMKIIgamma was aberrantly activated in human MM and its expression level was positively correlated with malignant progression and poor prognosis. Ectopic expression of CaMKIIgamma promoted cell growth, colony formation, cell cycle progress and inhibited apoptosis of MM cell lines, whereas, knockdown of CAMKIIgamma expression suppressed MM cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, we observed that CaMKIIgamma overexpression upregulated p-ERK and p-Stat3 levels and suppression of CaMKIIgamma had opposite effects. CaMKIIgamma is frequently dysregulated in MM and plays a critical role in maintaining MM cell growth through upregulating STAT3 signaling pathway.

METHODS: Human retinal endothelial cell (HRECs) induced by high glucose to simulate one of the pathogenesis in the diabetic retinopathy (DR) model. After LIF treatment, cell viability was detected by CCK-8 and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Angiogenesis was detected by in vitro tube formation. The expression levels of inflammatory, angiogenesis related proteins and CaMKII-CREB were detected by western blot. The gene level of angiogenesis was detected by qRT-PCR. HE staining was used to detect pathological changes of retinopathy in diabetic mice after LIF treatment. RESULTS: Our results showed that LIF significantly increased hyperglycaemic-induced cell viability and inhibited apoptosis. Western blot results showed that LIF could down-regulate the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha. In addition, angiogenesis of HRECs was inhibited by LIF in tubulisation experiments. LIF can down-regulate protein and gene levels of VEGF and HIF-1alpha via western blot and qRT-PCR. In diabetic mice induced by STZ, LIF could down-regulate the protein level of VEGF, HIF-1alpha, p-CaMKII and p-CREB, which suggest that LIF could inhibit retinal angiogenesis in diabetic mice. The results of HE staining showed that LIF could alleviate the damage of retinopathy in diabetic mice. CONCLUSION: LIF could alleviate the damage of diabetic retinopathy by modulating the CaMKII/CREB signalling pathway to inhibit inflammatory response and angiogenesis.","['Wang, Lei', 'Wu, Qiong', 'Wang, Rui Qi', 'Wang, Run Ze', 'Wang, Jianwen']","['Wang L', 'Wu Q', 'Wang RQ', 'Wang RZ', 'Wang J']","['The 2nd Ward of Ophthalmological, First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.', 'Visual Optical Center, First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.', 'The 2nd Ward of Ophthalmological, First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.', 'The 2nd Ward of Ophthalmological, First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.', 'The 2nd Ward of Ophthalmological, First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Arch Physiol Biochem,Archives of physiology and biochemistry,9510153,,IM,,['NOTNLM'],"['HRECs', 'Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF)', 'angiogenesis', 'diabetic retinopathy (DR)']",2020/07/14 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13813455.2020.1792506 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Arch Physiol Biochem. 2020 Jul 13:1-8. doi: 10.1080/13813455.2020.1792506.,,20200713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the difference in frequency of HDSG in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) Rich hematopoietic Cell population (HRCs) from bone marrow (BM) and spleen of C3H mice irradiated with 3 Gy X-rays. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 8-weeks old male C3H mice were irradiated 3Gy of whole body X-ray (1 Gy/min) and mice were sacrificed at 1, 4, 8, and 26 weeks. Then, HSPCs were isolated from BM of femur and spleen, the frequency of HRCs with Sfpi1 gene deletion was analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of HRCs with HDSG in both BM and spleen was increased 1 week after X-irradiation. Then, the frequency of HRCs with HDSG in BM showed a gradual decrease from 4 to 26 weeks, whereas HRCs with HDSG in spleen remained high, even at 26 weeks after X-irradiation. HDSG is less likely to be eliminated, particularly in the spleen, after X-irradiation.

The present study aims to determine the frequency of depression among MM hospitalized patients, in order to assess the possible differences between those with and without depression in relation to sociodemographic and clinical variables and to measure the impact of depression on hospitalization outcomes. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was performed using an administrative data set of all hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of MM between 2000 and 2015 in Portuguese mainland public hospitals. Codes related to depressive disorders were grouped to generate the dichotomous variable of depression (yes/no). A multivariate analysis was conducted and adjusted odd ratios (aOR) calculated between different variables and depression. RESULTS: Of a total of 14.575 MM hospitalizations studied, a concurrent code of depression was registered in 666 patients (4.6%). A greater odds of depression was observed in female patients (aOR = 2.26; 95%CI = 1.91-2.66), transplanted patients (aOR = 1.78; 95%CI = 1.44-2.20), patients with plasma cell leukemia (aOR = 1.79; 95%CI = 1.22-2.64) and patients with a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (aOR = 1.10; 95%CI = 1.05-1.15). Length of stay was longer in patients with a registered diagnosis of depression (aOR = 1.01; 95%CI = 1.01-1.02) while the odds of in-hospital mortality were lower in these patients (aOR = 0.53; 95%CI = 0.41-0.68). CONCLUSIONS: These results may help identify MM inpatients at higher risk of presenting depression (female gender, younger age, high CCI, plasma cell leukemia, transplant procedure). This will enable timely psychological assessment and treatment to prevent worse outcomes and higher healthcare costs associated with depression.","['Ribeiro-Carvalho, Francisco', 'Goncalves-Pinho, Manuel', 'Bergantim, Rui', 'Freitas, Alberto', 'Fernandes, Lia']","['Ribeiro-Carvalho F', 'Goncalves-Pinho M', 'Bergantim R', 'Freitas A', 'Fernandes L']","['Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto (FMUP), Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, Centro Hospitalar do Tamega e Sousa, Penafiel, Portugal.', 'Center for Health Technology and Services Research (CINTESIS), FMUP, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Community Medicine, Information and Health Decision Sciences (MEDCIDS), FMUP, Porto, Portugal.', 'Hematology Department, Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Sao Joao (CHUSJ), Porto, Portugal.', 'i3S-Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude, Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Cancer Drug Resistance Group, IPATIMUP-Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology of the University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Center for Health Technology and Services Research (CINTESIS), FMUP, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Community Medicine, Information and Health Decision Sciences (MEDCIDS), FMUP, Porto, Portugal.', 'Center for Health Technology and Services Research (CINTESIS), FMUP, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences and Mental Health, FMUP, Porto, Portugal.', 'Psychiatry Service, CHUSJ, Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adult', 'Depression/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Portugal/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['*administrative data', '*cancer', '*depression', '*hospitalization', '*inpatient', '*multiple myeloma', '*oncology', '*psycho-oncology']",2020/07/14 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.5469 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2020 Oct;29(10):1587-1594. doi: 10.1002/pon.5469.

Here, we present a selection of new targets and technologies that illustrate the progress that is being made with the aspiration to make CAR-T cell therapy a universally applicable and effective treatment in cancer medicine. RECENT FINDINGS: There is a rich pipeline of new target antigens for CAR-T cells in hematology and oncology that are rated based on uniformity but also stability of expression on tumor cells under therapeutic pressure. New technologies in CAR-T cell engineering are directed at neutralizing inhibitory ligands and factors in the tumor microenvironment, preventing CAR-T cell exhaustion and enhancing selectivity for tumor cells with 'smart' CAR designs. The manufacture of CAR-T cells using virus-free protocols is anticipated to reduce supply-chain complexity and to improve patient access. SUMMARY: CD19 CAR-T cell therapy is an approved treatment for B-cell leukemia and -lymphoma and considering the current 'target and technology' pipeline, we anticipate that additional CAR-T cell products will accomplish their 'breakthrough' and clinical proof-of-concept in other indications in hematology and in oncology. Technologies to enhance therapeutic index and facilitate manufacturing will be key for assuring availability and accessibility of CAR-T cell products and their implementation into routine clinical practice.","['Freitag, Fabian', 'Maucher, Marius', 'Riester, Zeno', 'Hudecek, Michael']","['Freitag F', 'Maucher M', 'Riester Z', 'Hudecek M']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik II, Universitatsklinikum Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology']",,,2020/07/14 06:00,2020/12/23 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CCO.0000000000000653 [doi]', '00001622-202009000-00016 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2020 Sep;32(5):510-517. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0000000000000653.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, 244 articles were acquired at the primary search. Study selection and quality assessment processes were done based on Cochrane library guidelines. According to six articles that were selected, curcumin could enhance the antitumor activity of chemotherapy drugs such as L-asparaginase. Curcumin induces apoptosis in Pre B- ALL and T- ALL cells by decreased NF-kB levels, increased p53 levels, PARP-1 cleavage. Also, the induction of growth-arrest and apoptosis in association with the blockade of constitutively active JAK-STAT pathway suggests this be a mechanism by curcumin.

Rapid research and development, on an international scale, has already generated assays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA and host immunoglobulins. However, the complexities of COVID-19 are such that fuller definitions of patient status, trajectory, sequelae, and responses to therapy are now required. There is accumulating evidence-from studies of both COVID-19 and the related disease SARS-that protein biomarkers could help to provide this definition. Proteins associated with blood coagulation (D-dimer), cell damage (lactate dehydrogenase), and the inflammatory response (e.g., C-reactive protein) have already been identified as possible predictors of COVID-19 severity or mortality. Proteomics technologies, with their ability to detect many proteins per analysis, have begun to extend these early findings. To be effective, proteomics strategies must include not only methods for comprehensive data acquisition (e.g., using mass spectrometry) but also informatics approaches via which to derive actionable information from large data sets. Here we review applications of proteomics to COVID-19 and SARS and outline how pipelines involving technologies such as artificial intelligence could be of value for research on these diseases.","['Whetton, Anthony D', 'Preston, George W', 'Abubeker, Semira', 'Geifman, Nophar']","['Whetton AD', 'Preston GW', 'Abubeker S', 'Geifman N']","['Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health (FBMH), University of Manchester, Manchester M20 4GJ, United Kingdom.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Cancer Research Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom.', 'Manchester National Institute for Health Biomedical Research Centre, Manchester M13 9WL, United Kingdom.', 'Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health (FBMH), University of Manchester, Manchester M20 4GJ, United Kingdom.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Cancer Research Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom.', 'Stoller Biomarker Discovery Centre, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health (FBMH), University of Manchester, Manchester M20 4GJ, United Kingdom.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Cancer Research Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Health Informatics, FBMH, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Artificial Intelligence', '*Betacoronavirus', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'COVID-19', '*Coronavirus Infections/blood/diagnosis/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted', 'Humans', '*Pandemics', '*Pneumonia, Viral/blood/diagnosis/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', '*Proteomics', 'SARS-CoV-2']",['NOTNLM'],"['*COVID-19', '*SARS-CoV-2', '*artificial intelligence', '*assay', '*biomarker', '*diagnosis', '*marker', '*prognosis', '*proteomics']",2020/07/14 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00326 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2020 Nov 6;19(11):4219-4232. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00326.

However, current clinical treatment with ABL inhibitors is seriously limited by drug resistance and adverse effects. Although the emerging proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have been introduced to degrade BCR-ABL, most of them showed limited activity and could not overcome the common drug-resistant mutants, especially for T315I mutant. Herein, we systematically designed a set of unique PROTACs by globally targeting all the three binding sites of BCR-ABL, including dasatinib-, ponatinib-, and asciminib-based PROTACs. Our ponatinib-based PROTACs showed practical activity as dasatinib-based PROTACs, while no reported ponatinib-based PROTACs could degrade BCR-ABL before. As a proof of concept, some additional dasatinib-based PROTACs were then designed to degrade T315I mutant too. We provided a global PROTAC toolbox for degrading both wild-type and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL from each binding site. More importantly, these PROTACs showed better selectivity and less adverse effects than the inhibitors, indicating that PROTACs had great potential for overcoming clinical drug resistance and safety issues.","['Yang, Yiqing', 'Gao, Hongying', 'Sun, Xiuyun', 'Sun, Yonghui', 'Qiu, Yueping', 'Weng, Qinjie', 'Rao, Yu']","['Yang Y', 'Gao H', 'Sun X', 'Sun Y', 'Qiu Y', 'Weng Q', 'Rao Y']","['MOE Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, MOE Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', 'Tsinghua University-Peking University Joint Center for Life Sciences, Beijing 100084, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, MOE Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', 'Tsinghua University-Peking University Joint Center for Life Sciences, Beijing 100084, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, MOE Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', 'Tsinghua University-Peking University Joint Center for Life Sciences, Beijing 100084, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, MOE Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', 'Tsinghua University-Peking University Joint Center for Life Sciences, Beijing 100084, China.', 'Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'Laboratory of Anti-Cancer Drug Research, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'Center for Drug Safety Evaluation and Research, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, MOE Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry & Chemical Biology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (asciminib)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dasatinib/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'Pyrazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyridazines/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,2020/07/14 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00967 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2020 Aug 13;63(15):8567-8583. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00967.

However, for human researchers studying viruses and hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly if our scientific understanding is also limited, which further lowers the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS (Topic-wise inference engine of massive biomedical literatures), a method that can deal with various scientific problems, such as liver cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and so forth, which can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, this information can be combined with independent functional data sources to build an inference system via a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. Using TWIRLS, we automatically analyzed more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hr. We found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. On triggering functional changes in ACE2/AT2R, the cytokine homeostasis regulation axis becomes imbalanced via the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10, leading to a cytokine storm. Through a preliminary analysis of blood indices of COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension, we found that non-ARB (Angiotensin II receptor blockers) users had more symptoms of severe illness than ARB users. This suggests ARBs could potentially be used to treat acute lung injury caused by coronavirus infection.","['Ji, Xiaoyang', 'Tan, Wenting', 'Zhang, Chunming', 'Zhai, Yubo', 'Hsueh, Yiching', 'Zhang, Zhonghai', 'Zhang, Chunli', 'Lu, Yanqiu', 'Duan, Bo', 'Tan, Guangming', 'Na, Renhua', 'Deng, Guohong', 'Niu, Gang']","['Ji X', 'Tan W', 'Zhang C', 'Zhai Y', 'Hsueh Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhang C', 'Lu Y', 'Duan B', 'Tan G', 'Na R', 'Deng G', 'Niu G']","['Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region College of Animal Science, Inner Mongolia Agricultural University, Hohhot, China.', 'Joint Turing-Darwin Laboratory of Phil Rivers Technology Ltd. and Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Computational Biology, Phil Rivers Technology Ltd, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.', 'Joint Turing-Darwin Laboratory of Phil Rivers Technology Ltd. and Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Computational Biology, Phil Rivers Technology Ltd, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'West Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Joint Turing-Darwin Laboratory of Phil Rivers Technology Ltd. and Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Computational Biology, Phil Rivers Technology Ltd, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Computational Biology, Phil Rivers Technology Ltd, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Chongqing Public Health Medical Center, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'West Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'West Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Animal Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region College of Animal Science, Inner Mongolia Agricultural University, Hohhot, China.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.', 'Joint Turing-Darwin Laboratory of Phil Rivers Technology Ltd. and Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Computational Biology, Phil Rivers Technology Ltd, Beijing, China.', 'West Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Drug Dev Res,Drug development research,8204468,,IM,,['NOTNLM'],"['coronavirus', 'cytokine storm', 'literature mining', 'renin-angiotensin system', 'topic inference']",2020/07/14 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ddr.21717 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Drug Dev Res. 2020 Jul 13. doi: 10.1002/ddr.21717.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3405-7983'],20200713,,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Similarities between diseases can be explained by characteristic gene expression patterns. However, most disease-disease relationships remain uncharacterized. RESULTS: In this study, we proposed a novel approach for network-based characterization of disease-disease relationships in terms of drugs and therapeutic targets. We performed large-scale analyses of omics data and molecular interaction networks for 79 diseases, including adrenoleukodystrophy, leukaemia, Alzheimer's disease, asthma, atopic dermatitis, breast cancer, cystic fibrosis and inflammatory bowel disease. We quantified disease-disease similarities based on proximities of abnormally expressed genes in various molecular networks, and showed that similarities between diseases could be explained by characteristic molecular network topologies. Furthermore, we developed a kernel matrix regression algorithm to predict the commonalities of drugs and therapeutic targets among diseases. Our comprehensive prediction strategy indicated many new associations among phenotypically diverse diseases.

Its alteration has been shown to coincide with the occurrence of cancer. A key challenge is in understanding the role of chromatin structure (CS) in cellular processes and its implications in diseases. RESULTS: We propose a comparative pipeline to analyze CSs and apply it to study chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We model the chromatin of the affected and control cells as networks and analyze the network topology by state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that CSs are a rich source of new biological and functional information about DNA elements and cells that can complement protein-protein and co-expression data. Importantly, we show the existence of structural markers of cancer-related DNA elements in the chromatin. Surprisingly, CLL driver genes are characterized by specific local wiring patterns not only in the CS network of CLL cells, but also of healthy cells. This allows us to successfully predict new CLL-related DNA elements. Importantly, this shows that we can identify cancer-related DNA elements in other cancer types by investigating the CS network of the healthy cell of origin, a key new insight paving the road to new therapeutic strategies. This gives us an opportunity to exploit chromosome conformation data in healthy cells to predict new drivers.

METHODS: Incidence or mortality risks for all cancers or all solid cancers combined and for leukemia were examined in 26 studies published in 2006-2017 involving low-dose (mean dose </=100 mGy) radiation from environmental, medical, or occupational sources. We evaluated the impact of loss to follow-up, under- or overascertainment, outcome misclassification, and changing classifications occurring similarly or differentially across radiation dose levels. RESULTS: Loss to follow-up was not reported in 62% of studies, but when reported it was generally small. Only one study critically evaluated the completeness of the sources of vital status. Underascertainment of cancers (""false negatives"") was a potential shortcoming for cohorts that could not be linked with high-quality population-based registries, particularly during early years of exposure in five studies, in two lacking complete residential history, and in one with substantial emigration. False positives may have occurred as a result of cancer ascertainment from self- or next-of-kin report in three studies or from enhanced medical surveillance of exposed patients that could lead to detection bias (eg, reporting precancer lesions as physician-diagnosed cancer) in one study. Most pediatric but few adult leukemia studies used expert hematopathology review or current classifications. Only a few studies recoded solid cancers to the latest International Classification of Diseases or International Classification of Diseases for Oncology codes. These outcome assessment shortcomings were generally nondifferential in relation to radiation exposure level except possibly in four studies. CONCLUSION: The majority of studies lacked information to enable comprehensive evaluation of all major sources of outcome assessment errors, although reported data suggested that the outcome assessment limitations generally had little effect on risk or biased estimates towards the null except possibly in four studies.","['Linet, Martha S', 'Schubauer-Berigan, Mary K', 'Berrington de Gonzalez, Amy']","['Linet MS', 'Schubauer-Berigan MK', 'Berrington de Gonzalez A']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Rockville, MD.', 'Monographs Programme, Evidence Synthesis and Classification Section, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.', 'Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Rockville, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

Since the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation report by the National Academies in 2006, new publications from large, well-powered epidemiological studies of low doses have reported positive dose-response relationships. It has been suggested, however, that biases could explain these findings. We conducted a systematic review of epidemiological studies with mean doses less than 100 mGy published 2006-2017. We required individualized doses and dose-response estimates with confidence intervals. We identified 26 eligible studies (eight environmental, four medical, and 14 occupational), including 91 000 solid cancers and 13 000 leukemias. Mean doses ranged from 0.1 to 82 mGy. The excess relative risk at 100 mGy was positive for 16 of 22 solid cancer studies and 17 of 20 leukemia studies. The aim of this monograph was to systematically review the potential biases in these studies (including dose uncertainty, confounding, and outcome misclassification) and to assess whether the subset of minimally biased studies provides evidence for cancer risks from low-dose radiation. Here, we describe the framework for the systematic bias review and provide an overview of the eligible studies.","['Berrington de Gonzalez, Amy', 'Daniels, Robert D', 'Cardis, Elisabeth', 'Cullings, Harry M', 'Gilbert, Ethel', 'Hauptmann, Michael', 'Kendall, Gerald', 'Laurier, Dominique', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Little, Mark P', 'Lubin, Jay H', 'Preston, Dale L', 'Richardson, David B', 'Stram, Daniel', 'Thierry-Chef, Isabelle', 'Schubauer-Berigan, Mary K']","['Berrington de Gonzalez A', 'Daniels RD', 'Cardis E', 'Cullings HM', 'Gilbert E', 'Hauptmann M', 'Kendall G', 'Laurier D', 'Linet MS', 'Little MP', 'Lubin JH', 'Preston DL', 'Richardson DB', 'Stram D', 'Thierry-Chef I', 'Schubauer-Berigan MK']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'CIBER Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.', 'Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Brandenburg Medical School Theodor Fontane, Institute of Biostatistics and Registry Research, Neuruppin, Germany.', 'Cancer Epidemiology Unit, NDPH, Oxford, UK.', 'IRSN, Paris, France.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology & Genetics, Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Hirosoft International, Seattle.', 'University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'CIBER Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Systematic Review']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

Since the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII review of the epidemiological data in 2006, many subsequent publications have reported excess cancer risks from low-dose exposures. Our aim was to systematically review these studies to assess the magnitude of the risk and whether the positive findings could be explained by biases. METHODS: Eligible studies had mean cumulative doses of less than 100 mGy, individualized dose estimates, risk estimates, and confidence intervals (CI) for the dose-response and were published in 2006-2017. We summarized the evidence for bias (dose error, confounding, outcome ascertainment) and its likely direction for each study. We tested whether the median excess relative risk (ERR) per unit dose equals zero and assessed the impact of excluding positive studies with potential bias away from the null. We performed a meta-analysis to quantify the ERR and assess consistency across studies for all solid cancers and leukemia. RESULTS: Of the 26 eligible studies, 8 concerned environmental, 4 medical, and 14 occupational exposure. For solid cancers, 16 of 22 studies reported positive ERRs per unit dose, and we rejected the hypothesis that the median ERR equals zero (P = .03). After exclusion of 4 positive studies with potential positive bias, 12 of 18 studies reported positive ERRs per unit dose (P = .12). For leukemia, 17 of 20 studies were positive, and we rejected the hypothesis that the median ERR per unit dose equals zero (P = .001), also after exclusion of 5 positive studies with potential positive bias (P = .02). For adulthood exposure, the meta-ERR at 100 mGy was 0.029 (95% CI = 0.011 to 0.047) for solid cancers and 0.16 (95% CI = 0.07 to 0.25) for leukemia. For childhood exposure, the meta-ERR at 100 mGy for leukemia was 2.84 (95% CI = 0.37 to 5.32); there were only two eligible studies of all solid cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic assessments in this monograph showed that these new epidemiological studies are characterized by several limitations, but only a few positive studies were potentially biased away from the null. After exclusion of these studies, the majority of studies still reported positive risk estimates. We therefore conclude that these new epidemiological studies directly support excess cancer risks from low-dose ionizing radiation. Furthermore, the magnitude of the cancer risks from these low-dose radiation exposures was statistically compatible with the radiation dose-related cancer risks of the atomic bomb survivors.","['Hauptmann, Michael', 'Daniels, Robert D', 'Cardis, Elisabeth', 'Cullings, Harry M', 'Kendall, Gerald', 'Laurier, Dominique', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Little, Mark P', 'Lubin, Jay H', 'Preston, Dale L', 'Richardson, David B', 'Stram, Daniel O', 'Thierry-Chef, Isabelle', 'Schubauer-Berigan, Mary K', 'Gilbert, Ethel S', 'Berrington de Gonzalez, Amy']","['Hauptmann M', 'Daniels RD', 'Cardis E', 'Cullings HM', 'Kendall G', 'Laurier D', 'Linet MS', 'Little MP', 'Lubin JH', 'Preston DL', 'Richardson DB', 'Stram DO', 'Thierry-Chef I', 'Schubauer-Berigan MK', 'Gilbert ES', 'Berrington de Gonzalez A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Systematic Review']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

Palliative cytoreduction aims to control blast count in order to avoid life-threatening complications and preserve quality of life in patients unfit for intensive treatment. In our center, low-dose intravenous melphalan is sometimes used with this intent. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with AML who were treated with low-dose intravenous melphalan (15-30 mg/m(2)) in a palliative setting. Results: Thirty patients with AML who received low-dose melphalan (15-25 mg/m(2)) were identified. In total, 63 administrations of low-dose melphalan were counted. A clear cytoreductive effect (>50%) was seen within a few days in 78% of melphalan administrations. The median duration of response after an individual dose was 17 days (interquartile range [IQR] 10-26). The median overall survival was 29 days (IQR 16-73). Most common side effects were worsening pancytopenia with neutropenic fever and an increase in transfusion dependency and tumor lysis syndrome. Conclusion: Intravenous low-dose melphalan is effective, quick and safe as palliative cytoreductive therapy in patients with hyperproliferative AML.

The results obtained from binding free energy calculations show that van der Waals interactions act as the main regulator in bindings of inhibitors to BRD4(1). The information stemming from PCA reveals that inhibitor associations extremely affect conformational changes, internal dynamics, and movement patterns of BRD4(1). Residue-based free energy decomposition method was wielded to unveil contributions of independent residues to inhibitor bindings and the data signify that hydrogen bonding interactions and hydrophobic interactions are decisive factors affecting bindings of inhibitors to BRD4(1). Meanwhile, eight residues Trp81, Pro82, Val87, Leu92, Leu94, Cys136, Asn140, and Ile146 are recognized as the common hot interaction spots of three inhibitors with BRD4(1). The results from this work are expected to provide a meaningfully theoretical guidance for design and development of effective inhibitors inhibiting of the activity of BRD4.","['Wu, S L', 'Wang, L F', 'Sun, H B', 'Wang, W', 'Yu, Y X']","['Wu SL', 'Wang LF', 'Sun HB', 'Wang W', 'Yu YX']","['School of Science, Shandong Jiaotong University , Jinan, China.', 'School of Science, Shandong Jiaotong University , Jinan, China.', 'School of Science, Shandong Jiaotong University , Jinan, China.', 'School of Science, Shandong Jiaotong University , Jinan, China.', 'School of Science, Shandong Jiaotong University , Jinan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,SAR QSAR Environ Res,SAR and QSAR in environmental research,9440156,"['0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', '*Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bromodomain-containing protein 4', 'binding free energy', 'cross-correlation maps', 'molecular dynamics simulations', 'principal component analysis']",2020/07/14 06:00,2020/09/25 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/1062936X.2020.1777584 [doi]'],ppublish,SAR QSAR Environ Res. 2020 Jul;31(7):547-570. doi: 10.1080/1062936X.2020.1777584.

In fact, many patients with AML relapse after standard therapy and eventually die from progressive disease. The basic concept of leukemic stem cells (LSC) has been coined with the goal to decipher clonal architectures in various leukemia-models and to develop curative drug therapies by eliminating LSC. Indeed, during the past few years, various immunotherapies have been tested in AML, and several of these therapies follow the strategy to eliminate relevant leukemic subclones by introducing LSC-targeting antibodies or LSC-targeting immune cells. These therapies include, among others, new generations of LSC-eliminating antibody-constructs, checkpoint-targeting antibodies, bi-specific antibodies, and CAR-T or CAR-NK cell-based strategies. However, responses are often limited and/or transient which may be due to LSC resistance. Indeed, AML LSC exhibit multiple forms of resistance against various drugs and immunotherapies. An additional problems are treatment-induced myelotoxicity and other side effects. The current article provides a short overview of immunological targets expressed on LSC in AML. Moreover, cell-based therapies and immunotherapies tested in AML are discussed. Finally, the article provides an overview about LSC resistance and strategies to overcome resistance.","['Valent, Peter', 'Bauer, Karin', 'Sadovnik, Irina', 'Smiljkovic, Dubravka', 'Ivanov, Daniel', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Filik, Yuksel', 'Eisenwort, Gregor', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Rabitsch, Werner']","['Valent P', 'Bauer K', 'Sadovnik I', 'Smiljkovic D', 'Ivanov D', 'Herrmann H', 'Filik Y', 'Eisenwort G', 'Sperr WR', 'Rabitsch W']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells Transl Med,Stem cells translational medicine,101578022,,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*transplantation', 'Precision Medicine/*methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR-T and CAR-NK cell-therapy', '*bi-specific antibodies', '*immune-checkpoints', '*leukemic stem cells', '*precision medicine', '*stem cell resistance']",2020/07/14 06:00,2021/09/03 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sctm.20-0147 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Transl Med. 2020 Nov;9(11):1331-1343. doi: 10.1002/sctm.20-0147.

DD is difficult to distinguish from other causes of dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in female patients. As DD female patients regularly progress into advanced heart failure (AHF) aged 20-40 years, their early identification is critical to improve patient survival and facilitate genetic counselling. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of DD among female patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, who reached AHF and were younger than 40 years. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 60 female patients: 47 (78%) heart transplant recipients, 2 (3%) patients treated with ventricular assist device, and 11 (18%) patients undergoing pre-transplant assessment. Aetiology of the cardiomyopathy was known in 15 patients (including two DD patients). LAMP2 expression in peripheral white blood cells (WBC) was tested by flow cytometry (FC) in the remaining 45 female patients. Whole exome sequencing was used as an alternative independent testing method to FC. Five additional female DD patients (two with different novel LAMP2 mutations) were identified by FC. The total prevalence of DD in this cohort was 12%. HCM phenotype (57% vs. 9%, (*) P = 0.022) and delta waves identified by electrocardiography (43% vs. 0%, (**) P = 0.002) were significantly more frequent in DD female patients. CONCLUSIONS: Danon disease is an underdiagnosed cause of AHF in young female patients. LAMP2 expression testing in peripheral WBCs by FC can be used as an effective screening/diagnostic tool to identify DD in this patient population.","['Gurka, Jiri', 'Piherova, Lenka', 'Majer, Filip', 'Chaloupka, Anna', 'Zakova, Daniela', 'Pelak, Ondrej', 'Krebsova, Alice', 'Peichl, Petr', 'Krejci, Jan', 'Freiberger, Tomas', 'Melenovsky, Vojtech', 'Kautzner, Josef', 'Kalina, Tomas', 'Sikora, Jakub', 'Kubanek, Milos']","['Gurka J', 'Piherova L', 'Majer F', 'Chaloupka A', 'Zakova D', 'Pelak O', 'Krebsova A', 'Peichl P', 'Krejci J', 'Freiberger T', 'Melenovsky V', 'Kautzner J', 'Kalina T', 'Sikora J', 'Kubanek M']","['Department of Cardiology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Research Unit for Rare Diseases, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Research Unit for Rare Diseases, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', ""1st Internal Cardioangiologic Clinic, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University and St. Anne's University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic."", 'Centre of Cardiovascular and Transplant Surgery, St. Annes University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cardiology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cardiology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic.', ""1st Internal Cardioangiologic Clinic, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University and St. Anne's University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic."", 'Centre of Cardiovascular and Transplant Surgery, St. Annes University Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cardiology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cardiology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Research Unit for Rare Diseases, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Pathology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cardiology, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,ESC Heart Fail,ESC heart failure,101669191,"['0 (LAMP2 protein, human)', '0 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2)']",IM,"['*Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Female', '*Glycogen Storage Disease Type IIb/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', '*Heart Failure/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein 2/genetics', 'Phenotype']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Advanced heart failure', '*Danon disease', '*Lysosomal-associated membrane protein type 2', '*Screening', '*White blood cells']",2020/07/14 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ehf2.12823 [doi]'],ppublish,ESC Heart Fail. 2020 Oct;7(5):2534-2543. doi: 10.1002/ehf2.12823.

In this setting, patient survival is often summarized using net survival, that is survival from cancer if there were no other possible causes of death. Although net survival is the gold standard for comparing survival between groups or over time, it is less relevant for understanding the anticipated real-world prognosis of patients. In this review, we explain statistical concepts targeted towards patients, clinicians and healthcare professionals that summarize cancer patient survival under the assumption that other causes of death exist. Specifically, we explain the appropriate use, interpretation and assumptions behind statistical methods for competing risks, loss in life expectancy due to cancer and conditional survival. These concepts are relevant when producing statistics for risk communication between physicians and patients, planning for use of healthcare resources, or other applications when consideration of both cancer outcomes and the competing risks of death is required. To reinforce the concepts, we use Swedish population-based data of patients diagnosed with cancer of the breast, prostate, colon and chronic myeloid leukaemia. We conclude that when choosing between summary measures of survival it is critical to characterize the purpose of the study and to determine the nature of the hypothesis under investigation. The choice of terminology and style of reporting should be carefully adapted to the target audience and may range from summaries for specialist readers of scientific publications to interactive online tools aimed towards lay persons.","['Eloranta, S', 'Smedby, K E', 'Dickman, P W', 'Andersson, T M']","['Eloranta S', 'Smedby KE', 'Dickman PW', 'Andersson TM']","['From the, Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'From the, Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Intern Med,Journal of internal medicine,8904841,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Colonic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality', 'Life Expectancy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Registries', 'Survival Analysis', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*biostatistics', '*cancer', '*death risk', '*epidemiology']",2020/07/14 06:00,2021/06/29 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/joim.13139 [doi]'],ppublish,J Intern Med. 2021 Jan;289(1):12-28. doi: 10.1111/joim.13139.

Two-year overall chronic GVHD (cGVHD) incidence was 42% vs 27% (P < .01) and extensive cGVHD incidence was 9% vs 12% (P = .33) in TBI and CT cohorts, respectively. Graft failure was reported in two (2%) TBI- and 65 (7%) CT-MAC recipients (P = .08). Death from veno-occlusive disease was reported in one (3%) TBI and 11 (3%) CT patients who died during the study period. In the multivariate analysis, TBI was associated with increased risk for overall cGVHD (hazard ratio = 1.95, 95% confidence interval:1.2-3.1, P < .01) compared to CT-based MAC. The choice of conditioning regimen did not impact relapse incidence, leukemia-free survival, non-relapse mortality, overall survival or GVHD-relapse-free survival in multivariate analysis. In conclusion, major transplant outcomes were not statistically different between TBI-based MAC and CT-based MAC in patients with AML after haplo-HCT/PTCy.","['Dholaria, Bhagirathbhai', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Angelucci, Emanuele', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Diez-Martin, Jose L', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Sica, Simona', 'Koc, Yener', 'Gulbas, Zafer', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Carella, Angelo Michele', 'Visani, Guiseppe', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Dholaria B', 'Labopin M', 'Angelucci E', 'Ciceri F', 'Diez-Martin JL', 'Bruno B', 'Sica S', 'Koc Y', 'Gulbas Z', 'Schmid C', 'Blaise D', 'Carella AM', 'Visani G', 'Savani BN', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Saint Antoine Hospital, INSERM UMR 938 and EBMT Paris Study Office / CEREST-TC, Paris, France.', 'Ematologia e Centro Trapianti, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Ospedale San Raffaele s.r.l., Haematology and BMT, Milano, Italy.', 'Hospital G U Gregorio Maranon, Instituto de investigacion sanitaria Gregorio Maranon, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain.', 'S.S.C.V.D Trapianto di Cellule Staminali, A.O.U Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Presidio Molinette, Torino, Italy.', 'Universita Cattolica S.

DEK was discovered to be an oncogene as a fusion with NUP214 gene, which results in producing DEK-NUP214 proteins, in a subset of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Subsequently, DEK overexpression was reported in many cancers, thus DEK itself is considered to be an oncoprotein. DEK has been reported to play important roles in the progression of early and late stage squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and is useful for early diagnosis of the disease. These findings have made DEK an attractive therapeutic target, especially for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated SCC. However, the mechanism of DEK in SCC remains unclear.

The diagnosis of a rheumatic disease is made by the sum of the findings in history, physical examination, laboratory, and imaging tests. A differential diagnosis list in pediatric rheumatology is quite long and mainly includes malignant, infectious, and inherited metabolic disorders. We aim to present cases that were referred to a pediatric rheumatology outpatient clinic with provisional diagnosis of a rheumatic disease but finally diagnosed with a non-rheumatic disease in order to emphasize the importance of differential diagnoses. Eight cases were presented in this manuscript. Five cases were referred with the provisional diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Sarcoidosis, chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis, and autoinflammatory disease were the provisional referral diagnoses in three patients. Definitive diagnoses of the patients were as follows: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (two cases), bilineage acute leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, brucellosis, mucolipidosis type III, anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, and Freiberg disease. In children presenting with rheumatic complaints malignant, infectious and inherited metabolic disorders should always be in the differential diagnosis list of a pediatric rheumatologist. Alternative diagnoses should always be considered even in patients with a rheumatic disease when the patient does not respond to treatment or follows an unusual clinical course.

We previously identified that cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) is overexpressed consistently in ATLL cells, and that CADM1 expression increases the adhesion capacity of ATLL cells to endothelial cells and promotes the organ invasion of ATLL cells in a xenograft mouse model. In this study, we first show that newly developed several anti-human CADM1 antibodies, which were complete human IgG antibodies generated by phage display method, specifically recognize CADM1 on ATLL cells. Although most of the CADM1 antibodies did not have a direct cytotoxic effect against CADM1-positive ATLL cells, clone 089-084 exhibited weak but significant antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxic activity. Moreover, clone 103-189 effectively inhibits the interaction between endothelial cells and CADM1-positive ATLL cells. Furthermore, in mice bearing intra-splenic transplantation of EL4 mouse lymphoma cells expressing CADM1, the treatment of 103-189 significantly suppressed the organ invasion of CADM1-positive EL4 cells, resulting in improved survival time of mice. Therefore, since the anti-CADM1 antibody may be useful for the suppression of organ invasion in ATLL patients, combination use of the anti-CADM1 antibody with chemotherapy drugs could be beneficial for the efficient elimination of ATLL cells.","['Chilmi, Syahrul', 'Nakahata, Shingo', 'Fauzi, Yanuar Rahmat', 'Ichikawa, Tomonaga', 'Tani, Chikako', 'Suwanruengsri, Mathurot', 'Yamaguchi, Ryoji', 'Matsuura, Tadashi', 'Kurosawa, Gene', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Chilmi S', 'Nakahata S', 'Fauzi YR', 'Ichikawa T', 'Tani C', 'Suwanruengsri M', 'Yamaguchi R', 'Matsuura T', 'Kurosawa G', 'Morishita K']","['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, Gakuen-kibanadai-nishi-1-1, Miyazaki, 889-2192, Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, Gakuen-kibanadai-nishi-1-1, Miyazaki, 889-2192, Japan.', 'Perseus Proteomics Inc., 4-7-6, Komaba Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 153-0041, Japan.', 'Innovation Center for Advanced Medicine, School of Medicine, Fujita Health University, 1-98 Dengakugakubo, Kutsukake-cho, Toyoake, Aichi, 470-1192, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan. kmorishi@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CADM1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Surface Display Techniques', 'Drug Development/*methods', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'Anti-cell adhesion molecule 1 antibody', 'Invasion', 'Phage display']",2020/07/14 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-02939-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-02939-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 Oct;112(4):496-503. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-02939-1.

Here, we report the functional analysis of PAX5-K220 in vitro. We successfully generated PAX5-K220 expressing cells and demonstrate that PAX5-K220 is a nuclear protein. Luciferase reporter assay reveals that PAX5-K220 inhibits wild-type PAX5 transcriptional activity in a dominant-negative fashion like other PAX5-related fusion proteins, and may contribute to lymphocyte differentiation block. However, although identified in Ph-like ALL, PAX5-K220 does not induce IL-3-independent proliferation when transduced in the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 murine leukemia cells, but rather attenuates growth. These results reveal that PAX5-K220 certainly shares the character with other PAX5-related fusion proteins rather than other fusion proteins with tyrosine kinase activity identified in Ph-like ALL, and did not contribute to proliferation activity. Precise functional analysis of each differently partnered PAX5 fusion protein is warranted in the future for better understanding of PAX5-related translocations and their effects.","['Kanayama, Takuyo', 'Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Mayumi, Azusa', 'Soma, Emi', 'Sakamoto, Kenichi', 'Hayakawa, Fumihiko', 'Tanizawa, Akihiko', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Hosoi, Hajime']","['Kanayama T', 'Imamura T', 'Mayumi A', 'Soma E', 'Sakamoto K', 'Hayakawa F', 'Tanizawa A', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Hosoi H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465, Kajii-cho, Kawaramachi-Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465, Kajii-cho, Kawaramachi-Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan. imamura@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465, Kajii-cho, Kawaramachi-Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical and Translational Physiology, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465, Kajii-cho, Kawaramachi-Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pathophysiological Laboratory Sciences, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Human Resource Development for Cancer, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, 465, Kajii-cho, Kawaramachi-Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (KIDINS220 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', '*Gene Fusion', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*analysis/*genetics', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/*analysis/*genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell differentiation arrest', 'KIDINS220', 'PAX5', 'Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2020/07/14 06:00,2020/11/25 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-02944-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-02944-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 Nov;112(5):714-719. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-02944-4.

This leads to fusion of the BCR and ABL1 genes, encoding an active tyrosine kinase that causes unregulated proliferation of the myeloid lineage. The BCR/ABL1 fusion protein is found not only in CML, but also in a subset of de novo B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-LL). However, the fusion protein in CML is characteristically the slightly longer p210 variant, whereas the p190 variant is more frequently found in B-LL. Without treatment, CML will progress to accelerated and/or blast phase (BP). Disease progression is often characterized by accumulation of additional chromosomal abnormalities. The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy that targets BCR/ABL1 has revolutionized treatment of CML and vastly improved outcomes, although the disease can still progress despite TKI therapy. Blast phase most commonly manifests as myeloid BP; however, up to 30% of BP presents as lymphoid BP (LBP), typically of the B-cell lineage. The B-lymphoblasts of LBP have a phenotype indistinguishable from that of de novo B-LL. However, LBP typically carries the p210 BCR/ABL transcript and may show distinct chromosomal anomalies, including loss of chromosome 9p. The prognosis for CML-BP is poor, although survival has improved with TKI therapy and stem cell transplant, and LBP has been associated with superior survival compared with myeloid BP. Here we present a case of CML in B-lymphoid BP and review the current literature.","['Ware, Alisha D', 'Wake, Laura', 'Brown, Patrick', 'Webster, Jonathan A', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Duffield, Amy S']","['Ware AD', 'Wake L', 'Brown P', 'Webster JA', 'Smith BD', 'Duffield AS']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AJSP Rev Rep,AJSP: reviews & reports,101671988,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-lymphoid blast phase', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'lymphoid blast phase', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2020/07/14 06:00,2020/07/14 06:01,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,AJSP Rev Rep. 2019 Sep-Oct;24(5):191-195.,,,,,['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7351361,,,['The authors have no conflicts to declare.'],,['NIHMS1603258'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is uncertain whether this regimen can provide durable donor-dominant chimerism also in patients with MF. We planned a two-stage allo-HCT in four patients - initially aimed at mixed chimerism with NMA conditioning and then reinforced with additional stem cell infusion if graft failure occurred. In one case with extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis, causing blindness and paraplegia, we achieved stable complete donor-chimerism and complete molecular response with disappearance of bone marrow fibrosis after allo-HCT. Although this NMA regimen failed to achieve durable donor-chimerism, additional stem cell infusion showed a possible role for stable long-term chimerism with good clinical outcomes.

The most common transcripts subtypes are e13a2 (b2a2) and e14a2 (b3a2). The prognostic impact of the type of BCR-ABL1 transcript has been the subject of controversies over time. In the imatinib era, several studies have suggested a deeper and faster response in patients expressing e14a2. However, the impact on response after first line therapy with a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, nilotinib, is unknown. We retrospectively evaluated 118 patients newly diagnosed with chronic phase CML and treated frontline with nilotinib inside or outside clinical trial in five French centers. Only patients expressing e14a2 or e13a2 transcripts alone were analyzed. At baseline, 55.3% expressed e14a2, 44.7% expressed e13a2. The median age was 51 years and median follow-up was 49 months. Relative risks of CML at diagnosis were similar according to the ELTS score (p = .87). Complete hematological response and complete cytogenetic response rates were similar among groups. Patients expressing e14a2 transcripts compared to e13a2 transcripts had deeper and faster molecular responses, when considering MMR (100% vs 84.1%, p = .007) with a median time of 6.7 and 17.1 months or MR(4.5) (100% vs 59.9%, p = .005) with a median time of 39.7 and 70.9 months, respectively. A sustained treatment free remission was observed in 10/10 patients with e14a2 versus 1/3 with e13a2 transcript (p = .04).

The activation of Lyn can result in imatinib resistance by regulating the formation of BCR-ABL protein complexes. SIRT1 is a novel survival pathway activated by BCR-ABL expression in haematopoietic progenitor cells. This study aimed to investigate whether the signaling pathway of Lyn/BCR-ABL/SIRT1 could mediate imatinib resistance in CML. METHODS: The MTT assay was used to detect cell viability. Apoptosis was measured by a flow cytometry assay. Protein expression was detected by Western blotting. Knockdown CML cells were constructed by shRNA interference. The CML mouse model was used to investigate the role of SIRT1 in CML in vivo. RESULTS: Lyn was overexpressed in K562R cells. BCR-ABL phosphorylation and activation were promoted by Lyn. Imatinib suppressed BCR-ABL phosphorylation in both K562 and K562R cells. BCR-ABL positively regulated SIRT1 and Foxo1 but negatively regulated acetylated Foxo1 (Ac-Foxo1) and p53 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 or knockdown of SIRT1 increased apoptosis and reduced growth in vitro and in vivo. Foxo1 was downregulated by SIRT1 inhibition or knockdown, while Ac-Foxo1 and p53 were upregulated. In vivo experiments showed that imatinib and/or SIRT1 inhibition both prolonged the survival of the CML mouse model and that the effects of imatinib were enhanced in combination with SIRT1 inhibition. CONCLUSION: We proposed a novel molecular mechanism of imatinib resistance in CML in which the high expression of Lyn in imatinib-resistant cells inhibited Ac-Foxo1 and p53 expression through the BCR-ABL/SIRT1/Foxo1 signaling pathway, thus reducing apoptosis and mediating imatinib resistance.","['Teng, Yue-Qiu', 'Jin, Hua', 'Liu, Zhi-Yu', 'Li, Dan-Dan', 'Ye, Xiang-Mei', 'Yang, Lu-Yuan', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Teng YQ', 'Jin H', 'Liu ZY', 'Li DD', 'Ye XM', 'Yang LY', 'Zhou J']","['Central Laboratory of Blood Cancer, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang Province, P.

The present study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of lncRNA LINC00265 in the regulation of apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. METHODS: Gain- or loss-of-function experiments were conducted in AML cells to explore the effect of LINC00265 on AML. Autophagy was assessed by examining levels of Beclin-1, p62, and ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I. Cell proliferation and apoptosis of AML cells were evaluated by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. RNA pull-down was performed to enrich miR-485-5p interacted with LINC00265. The interaction between miR-485-5p and IRF2 3'UTR was analyzed by luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: LINC00265 expression was significantly up-regulated, whereas miR-485-5p was down-regulated in serum of AML patients and AML cell lines. LINC00265 promoted, whereas miR-485-5p suppressed autophagy in AML cells. Mechanistically, LINC00265 functioned as a ceRNA for miR-485-5p to facilitate IRF2 expression. More importantly, LINC00265 overexpression or miR-485-5p inhibitor reversed the 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor)-mediated proliferation-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects, whereas LINC00265 silencing or miR-485-5p mimic overturned the proliferation-promoting and anti-apoptotic effects of autophagy activator rapamycin. CONCLUSION: LINC00265 attenuates AML cell apoptosis by inducing autophagy via miR-485/IRF2 axis.","['Zhang, Feng', 'Li, Qianwen', 'Zhu, Kai', 'Zhu, Junfeng', 'Li, Jiajia', 'Yuan, Yuan', 'Zhang, Pingping', 'Zhou, Lili', 'Liu, Lin']","['Zhang F', 'Li Q', 'Zhu K', 'Zhu J', 'Li J', 'Yuan Y', 'Zhang P', 'Zhou L', 'Liu L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College Bengbu 233004, Anhui, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College Bengbu 233004, Anhui, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College Bengbu 233004, Anhui, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College Bengbu 233004, Anhui, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College Bengbu 233004, Anhui, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College Bengbu 233004, Anhui, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College Bengbu 233004, Anhui, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College Bengbu 233004, Anhui, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College Bengbu 233004, Anhui, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['LINC00265', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy']",2020/07/14 06:00,2020/07/14 06:01,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2019/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2020 Jun 15;12(6):2451-2462. eCollection 2020.,,20200615,,['AJTR Copyright (c) 2020.'],,PMC7344095,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we describe the mutational landscape and its clinico-pathological significance in 26 myeloid neoplasm patients from a South Asian population (Pakistan) by using ultra-deep targeted next-generation DNA sequencing of 54 genes ( approximately 5000x) and its subsequent bioinformatics analysis. The data analysis indicated novel non-silent somatic mutational events previously not reported in AML, including nine non-synonymous and one stop-gain mutations. Notably, two recurrent somatic non-synonymous mutations, i.e., STAG2 (causing p.L526F) and BCORL1 (p.A400V), were observed in three unrelated cases each. The BCOR was found to have three independent non-synonymous somatic mutations in three cases. Further, the SRSF2 with a protein truncating somatic mutation (p.Q88X) was observed for the first time in AML in this study. The prioritization of germline mutations with ClinVar, SIFT, Polyphen2, and Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) highlighted 18 predicted deleterious/pathogenic mutations, including two recurrent deleterious mutations, i.e., a novel heterozygous non-synonymous SNV in GATA2 (p.T358P) and a frameshift insertion in NPM1 (p.L258fs), found in two unrelated cases each. The WT1 was observed with three independent potential detrimental germline mutations in three different cases. Collectively, non-silent somatic and/or germline mutations were observed in 23 (88.46%) of the cases (0.92 mutation per case). Furthermore, the pharmGKB database exploration showed a missense SNV rs1042522 in TP53, exhibiting decreased response to anti-cancer drugs, in 19 (73%) of the cases. This genomic profiling of AML provides deep insight into the disease pathophysiology. Identification of pharmacogenomics markers will help to adopt personalized approach for the management of AML patients in Pakistan.","['Shahid, Saba', 'Shakeel, Muhammad', 'Siddiqui, Saima', 'Ahmed, Shariq', 'Sohail, Misha', 'Khan, Ishtiaq Ahmad', 'Abid, Aiysha', 'Shamsi, Tahir']","['Shahid S', 'Shakeel M', 'Siddiqui S', 'Ahmed S', 'Sohail M', 'Khan IA', 'Abid A', 'Shamsi T']","['Department of Genomics, National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Jamil-ur-Rahman Center for Genome Research, Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research, International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Genomics, National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Genomics, National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Jamil-ur-Rahman Center for Genome Research, Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research, International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Centre for Human Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT), Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Institute of Blood Diseases and Bone Marrow Transplantation Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'genomic screening', 'myeloid sequencing panel', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel no-silent somatic mutation']",2020/07/14 06:00,2020/07/14 06:01,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2019/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2020.00560 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2020 Jun 23;11:560. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2020.00560. eCollection 2020.,,20200623,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Shahid, Shakeel, Siddiqui, Ahmed, Sohail, Khan, Abid and', 'Shamsi.']",,PMC7324646,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This framework can provide diagnostic challenges for immunophenotypically heterogeneous immature leukemias, and ignores recent advances in understanding of developmental multipotency of diverse normal hematopoietic progenitor populations that are identified by transcriptional signatures. We performed transcriptional analyses of a large series of acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemias and detected significant overlap in gene expression between cases in different diagnostic categories. Bioinformatic classification of leukemias along a continuum of hematopoietic differentiation identified leukemias at the myeloid/T-lymphoid interface, which shared gene expression programs with a series of multi or oligopotent hematopoietic progenitor populations, including the most immature CD34+CD1a-CD7- subset of early thymic precursors. Within these interface acute leukemias (IALs), transcriptional resemblance to early lymphoid progenitor populations and biphenotypic leukemias was more evident in cases originally diagnosed as AML, rather than T-ALL. Further prognostic analyses revealed that expression of IAL transcriptional programs significantly correlated with poor outcome in independent AML patient cohorts. Our results suggest that traditional binary approaches to acute leukemia categorization are reductive, and that identification of IALs could allow better treatment allocation and evaluation of therapeutic options.","['Bond, Jonathan', 'Krzywon, Aleksandra', 'Lhermitte, Ludovic', 'Roumier, Christophe', 'Roggy, Anne', 'Belhocine, Mohamed', 'Kheirallah, Alexander Abdulkader', 'Villarese, Patrick', 'Hypolite, Guillaume', 'Garnache-Ottou, Francine', 'Castaigne, Sylvie', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Laurenti, Elisa', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth']","['Bond J', 'Krzywon A', 'Lhermitte L', 'Roumier C', 'Roggy A', 'Belhocine M', 'Kheirallah AA', 'Villarese P', 'Hypolite G', 'Garnache-Ottou F', 'Castaigne S', 'Boissel N', 'Asnafi V', 'Preudhomme C', 'Dombret H', 'Laurenti E', 'Macintyre E']","['Universite de Paris, Institut Necker Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicale (INSERM UMR1151), 75743, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Systems Biology Ireland, School of Medicine, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.', ""National Children's Research Centre, Children's Health Ireland at Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Wellcome and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Silesian University of Technology, Department of Systems Biology and Engineering, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Universite de Paris, Institut Necker Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicale (INSERM UMR1151), 75743, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Cancer Research Institute, INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR)-S 1172, F-59000, Lille, France.', 'CHU Lille, Laboratory of Hematology, F-59000, Lille, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Institut Necker Enfants Malades (INEM), Institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicale (INSERM UMR1151), 75743, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Onco-Hematology, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Univ.

The outcomes of SIR-TAC in a more intense RIC regimen as Thiotepa-fludarabine-busulfan (TBF) have been hardly investigated. This retrospective study included all consecutive patients receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for myeloid malignancies (January 2009-2017) conditioned with either TBF or BF and receiving SIR-TAC. Patients receiving TBF presented higher non-relapse mortality (31.6 vs 12.3%, p = .01), along with shorter overall survival (51.8% vs 77.8%, p < .01) at 2 years than patients treated with BF. There were no significant differences in the cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD or moderate-severe chronic GVHD or relapse between both groups.

The TMLI-containing regimen is safe and alternative for patients with high-risk ALL undergoing allo-HSCT.","['Zhao, Xiaoyan', 'Lu, Xuan', 'Tang, Liang', 'Yan, Han', 'Chen, Wenlan', 'Shi, Wei', 'Zhong, Zhaodong', 'You, Yong', 'Xia, Linghui', 'Hu, Yu', 'Wang, Huafang']","['Zhao X', 'Lu X', 'Tang L', 'Yan H', 'Chen W', 'Shi W', 'Zhong Z', 'You Y', 'Xia L', 'Hu Y', 'Wang H']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow', '*Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Total marrow and lymphoid irradiation', '*conditioning regimen', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2020/07/14 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1789621 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Dec;61(12):2859-2867. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1789621.

Methods: This was a multicenter retrospective clinical study. Patients aged above 18 years newly diagnosed with PRCA between June 1, 2010, and June 1, 2019, were recruited as the main study object. A comparative analysis of remission rate and overall survival rate was made according to different treatment schemes adopted by patients and different drug reduction rates. Results: A total of 67 patients with PRCA were included in this study and the secondary PRCA group accounted for 44.8% (30/67) . The most common secondary factors were thymoma (n=10) and T-cell large lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) (n=6) . The overall response rate of PRCA was 85.7% and the 3-year overall survival rate of PRCA was (74.3+/-7.5) %. The remission rate of cyclosporine A alone was slightly higher than that of oral glucocorticoid alone or combined with glucocorticoid[90.0% (36/40) vs 75.0% (12/16) , P=0.147]. After patients applied with cyclosporine A treatment reached CR/PR and remained stable for 3-6 months, the dose of cyclosporine A was reduced by 25 mg each time. The cyclosporine A reduction interval of a 25 mg/d reduction in more than 1 month significantly prolonged the median disease-free survival compared with a 25 mg/d reduction in less than 1 month [not reached vs 15 (95% CI 7-23) months, P<0.001]. There were 62.5% (10/16) of patients who responded to the initial or incremental treatment regimen after relapse. Conclusion: PRCA has features of various secondary factors, high overall survival rate, and high remission rate. Treatment with cyclosporine A alone is preferred, and cyclosporine A should be slowly tapered to reduce the risk of later relapse after it takes effect and patients reach a steady state.","['Wang, Q', 'Ma, J X', 'Li, B H', 'Wang, X Q', 'Hu, Q', 'Zhang, M X']","['Wang Q', 'Ma JX', 'Li BH', 'Wang XQ', 'Hu Q', 'Zhang MX']","['Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huadong Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 200071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['*Anemia, Aplastic', 'Cyclosporine', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', '*Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thymus Neoplasms']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cyclosporine A', 'Dosage reduction', 'Pure red cell aplastic anemia']",2020/07/14 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.06.013 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Jun 14;41(6):506-510. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.06.013.,,,,,,PMC7378292,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The clinical data of 11 Burkitt leukemia patients in our hospital from January 30, 2006, to September 12, 2018, were collected. The clinical details, complete remission (CR) rate, overall survival (OS) , relapse-free survival (RFS) , and adverse events were evaluated. Results: The median age of 11 patients was 34 (15-54) years, of which six were males and five were females (MratioF, 1.2ratio1) . The median white blood cell (WBC) count was 12.28 (2.21-48.46) x10(9)/L, and the median blast percent of peripheral blood and bone marrow were 40% (3%-76%) and 84.0% (29.5%-94.5%) , respectively. Ten patients were administered with rituximab combined with a short-course and intensive regimens, and two patients underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation following consolidation chemotherapy. The CR rate after one cycle of induction therapy was 100%, the four-year OS was 90%, and RFS was 90%. Out of the ten treated patients, only one patient suffered from tumor lysis syndrome during the induction chemotherapy. Consequently, renal function recovered after hemodialysis and other treatments. The regimen is safe with no treatment-related deaths. Conclusions: Rituximab combined with short-course and intensive chemotherapy regimens is effective and well-tolerated in adult Burkitt leukemia.","['Li, Y', 'Gong, X Y', 'Zhao, X L', 'Wei, H', 'Wang, Y', 'Lin, D', 'Zhou, C L', 'Liu, B C', 'Wang, H J', 'Li, C W', 'Li, Q H', 'Gong, B F', 'Liu, Y T', 'Wei, S N', 'Zhang, G J', 'Mi, Y C', 'Wang, J X', 'Liu, K Q']","['Li Y', 'Gong XY', 'Zhao XL', 'Wei H', 'Wang Y', 'Lin D', 'Zhou CL', 'Liu BC', 'Wang HJ', 'Li CW', 'Li QH', 'Gong BF', 'Liu YT', 'Wei SN', 'Zhang GJ', 'Mi YC', 'Wang JX', 'Liu KQ']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College;

Methods: One refractory B-ALL patient relapsed after murine CD19 CAR-T cell therapy followed by a sibling allo-HSCT. He underwent a humanized CD19 CAR-T cell therapy followed by donor stem cell and donor T lymphocytes infusions as maintenance therapy in our hospital. The level of cytokines, the proportion of CD19 CAR-T cell, the level of CAR19 DNA expression in the peripheral blood, and the proportion of leukemia cells and donor chimerism in the bone marrow were detected. Correspondingly, T lymphocytes from the C57 spleen were separated to modify the CD19 CAR lentivirus and refused into C57 mice, and after 14 days, the B lymphocytes from C57 mice were separated and refused into the same C57 mice. The CD19 CAR T cells, B cells, and CD19 CAR gene counts in the peripheral blood were evaluated at different time points. Results: 1 in circleThe patient achieved a complete response (CR) 14 days after a humanized CD19 CAR-T therapy with grade 1 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and restored a donor chimerism to 99.76%. 2 in circle Following the remission from humanized CD19 CAR-T therapy, the patient received a maintenance therapy of donor stem cell infusion. Mild graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) manifested 24 days after infusion with an increased proportion of CD19 CAR-T cells and an increased level of CAR19 DNA expression in the peripheral blood. It fell with the remission of GVHD. The patient maintained CR and 99.69% donor chimerism during this period. 3 in circle Throughout the subsequent donor T lymphocytes maintenance therapy, mild GVHD surfaced12 days after infusion without an increased proportion of CD19 CAR-T cells and an increased level of CAR19 DNA expression in the peripheral blood. The patient maintained CR and 99.87% donor chimerism during this period. 4 in circle In vivo experiments on C57 mice confirmed that the proportion of CD19 CAR-T cells and the level of CAR19 DNA expression were upregulated in mice following CAR-T cell infusion, accompanied by depletion of CD19(+) B lymphocyte. After infusion of CD19(+) B lymphocyte cells, an increased proportion of CD19 CAR-T cells and an increased level of CAR19 DNA expression in the peripheral blood were observed again. Conclusions: The infusion of donor stem cells and donor T lymphocytes could be used as a maintenance treatment after CD19 CAR-T cell therapy for B-ALL patients who relapsed after allo-HSCT.

Methods: The clinical data of 14 patients with R/R Ph(+) B-ALL treated with CD19 CAR-T cell therapy from November 2016 to April 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Among the 14 patients in this study, 7 were male and 7 were female, with a median age of 33 (7-66) years old. The efficacy was evaluated on the 28th day following CAR-T cells infusion; the overall response rate was 100.0% (14/14) , the complete response (CR) rate was 92.9% (13/14) , and the partial response (PR) rate was 7.1% (1/14) . After CAR-T cells infusion,12 cases (85.7%) developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS) : 1 case of grade 1 CRS, 4 cases of grade 2 CRS, 6 cases of grade 3 CRS, and 1 case of grade 4 CRS. Moreover, one case developed CAR T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) ; 14 cases had - hematological toxicity; and 13 CR cases had B cell dysplasia. These adverse reactions were all controllable. The median follow-up time was 441 (182-923) d.

Method: A high-throughput sequencing was carried out to detect 68 related genes in 465 AML patients. Clonal heterogeneity was analyzed based on variant allele frequency (VAF) and flow cytometry results combined with clinical data. Results: Gene mutations were discovered in 338 (81.4%) newly diagnosed patients, and 2 or more clones were significantly increased in patients with DNMT3A, NRAS, and RUNX1 mutations (DNMT3A, chi(2)=15.23; P<0.001; NRAS, chi(2)=19.866; P<0.001; RUNX1, chi(2)=23.647; P<0.001) . The number of clones significantly differed between groups at different ages (chi(2)=17.505, P=0.022) . The proportion of carrying 2 and >/=3 clones increased in patients aged more than 60 years old. There was a significant difference in the clonal heterogeneity between newly diagnosed patients and relapsed or secondary patients (chi(2)=11.302, P=0.010) . Moreover, the proportion of patients with clonal heterogeneity gradually increased according to their prognostic risk (chi(2)=17.505, P=0.022) . Based on the clone analysis, the proportion of primary clones of patients with RUNX1 mutation was higher (chi(2)=4.527, P=0.033) . The analysis of clonal heterogeneity and efficacy demonstrated that patients with three or more clones had significantly lower overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to other patients (OS, chi(2)=13.533; P=0.004; PFS, chi(2)=9.817; P=0.020) , while in the intermediate-risk group, patients with a significant clonal heterogeneity also exhibited a significant decrease in PFS (chi(2)=10.883, P=0.012) . Cox regression multivariate analysis revealed that carrying three or more clones was an independent factor affecting prognosis, and OS and PFS were significantly lower than those of patients without clones (OS, HR=3.296; 95% CI, 1.568-6.932; P=0.002; PFS, HR=3.241; 95% CI, 1.411-7.440; P=0.006) .

Methods: Imatinib-, nilotinib-, and/or dasatinib-resistant patients with CML who screened BCR-ABL mutation (s) in Peking University People's Hospital between June 2001 and September 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. BCR-ABL mutation was analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Binary logistic regression model was built to identify independent clinical variables associated with developing BCR-ABL mutation (s) . Results: Data of 1 093 TKI-resistant cases in 804 patients who experienced resistance to imatinib (n=576, 52.7%) , nilotinib (n=238, 21.8%) , and dasatinib (n=279, 25.5%) were analyzed. In total, 291 (50.5%) imatinib-, 152 (63.9%) nilotinib-, and 160 (57.3%) dasatinib-resistant cases developed BCR-ABL mutation (s) . T315I mutation was the most frequent mutation detected in imatinib-, nilotinib-, and dasatinib-resistant cases, accounting for 12.3%, 27.3%, and 34.1%, respectively. Y253F/H (7.5%) and F359V/C/I (5.6%) were the mutation detected in >/=5% imatinib-resistant cases; F359V/C/I (12.2%) , Y253F/H (11.8%) , and E255K/V (10.5%) in nilotinib-resistant cases; and F317L/V/I/C (11.5%) and E255K/V (5.4%) in dasatinib-resistant cases. In multivariate analyses, no TKI dose reduction or discontinuation of TKI therapy was the common variable associated with developing BCR-ABL mutation (s) . Other variables associated with developing BCR-ABL mutation (s) in imatinib-, nilotinib-, or dasatinib-resistant cases included male gender, younger age, no comorbidity, advanced phase before starting current TKI therapy, longer interval from diagnosis to starting current TKI therapy, acquired resistance, and TKI resistance due to progression to advanced phase or hematologic failure. In addition, interval from TKI failure to BCR-ABL mutation detection, starting initial TKI therapy to TKI failure, and starting current TKI therapy to TKI failure were associated with the frequency of developing BCR-ABL mutation. Dasatinib and nilotinib use and acquired resistance were identified to be associated with the development of T315I mutation in multivariate analyses. Conclusions: More than half of TKI-resistant CML patients developed BCR-ABL mutation (s) by Sanger sequencing. T315I mutation was the most frequently detected. Clinical variables significantly associated with developing BCR-ABL mutation (s) should be used not only as basis for the choice of subsequent TKIs but also the understanding of TKI-resistant mechanisms.","['Shi, D Y', 'Qin, Y Z', 'Lai, Y Y', 'Shi, H X', 'Huang, X J', 'Jiang, Q']","['Shi DY', 'Qin YZ', 'Lai YY', 'Shi HX', 'Huang XJ', 'Jiang Q']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation', 'Drug resistance', 'Leukemia, myeloid, chronic', 'T315I mutation', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2020/07/14 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2020/07/14 06:00'],"['2020/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.06.006 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Jun 14;41(6):469-476. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.06.006.,,,,,['81370637/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],PMC7378281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a Philadelphia chromosome-positive myeloproliferative neoplasm, the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has transformed CML from a lethal into a manageable chronic disease with a close-to-normal life expectancy. To date it is unknown whether kidney transplantation can be safely performed in patients with pre-existing CML. We describe the clinical course of a 57-year-old male patient with chronic kidney disease caused by reflux nephropathy. This patient had undergone first kidney transplantation 20 years earlier and had again been on chronic hemodialysis for 6 years when CML was diagnosed. First-line therapy with 400 mg imatinib daily was well tolerated and induced an optimal cytogenetic and molecular response 3 months after initiation. One and a half years after CML diagnosis, a second kidney transplantation from a deceased donor was performed.

METHODS: Cancer patient who required treatment, were evaluated for potential COVID-19 infection in a 90-day period, starting from beginning of this epidemic in Iran, January, to April 19, 2020. For treatment of solid tumor patients, if they did not have symptoms related to COVID-19, just chest X-ray was requested. If they showed COVID-19 related symptoms, high resolution CT scan of lungs was requested. For hematology cancer patients, PCR test for COVID-19 infection was requested as well. Protection measures were considered for personnel of oncology wards. RESULTS: 279 Patients were followed up in this 90-day period. No COVID-19 infection was observed in 92 cases of breast cancer, 14 cases of gastric cancer and 12 cases of pancreaticobiliary cancer. However, in 72 cases of colon cancer, 11 cases of lung cancer, 5 cases brain tumors and 12 cases ovarian cancer; 4 cases of COVID-19 were observed. In the hematology cancers group, which included 14 cases of Hodgkin's disease, 23 cases of lymphoproliferative disorder, 12 cases of acute leukemia and 12 cases of multiple myeloma; 3 cases of COVID-19 were observed. CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer who need treatment can be treated by taking some measures. These measures include observing individual and collective protection principles in patients and health-care personnel, increasing patients' awareness particularly about self-care behavior, performing a COVID-19 test, and taking a chest X-ray, before the treatment starts.","['Aznab, Mozaffar']",['Aznab M'],"['Medical oncologist-Hematologist, Internal Medicine Department, Talaghani Hospital, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. draznab@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,,IM,"['Betacoronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'Coronavirus Infections/*complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', '*Pandemics/prevention & control', 'Pneumonia, Viral/*complications/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",['NOTNLM'],"['COVID-19', 'Cancer', 'Hematology tumor', 'Solid tumor', 'Treatment']",2020/07/13 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2020/07/13 06:00'],"['2020/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10147-020-01734-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s10147-020-01734-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2020 Sep;25(9):1581-1586. doi: 10.1007/s10147-020-01734-6.

Significant advances have recently been made regarding skin cancers, but data on cases of MCC are rather limited as these patients are frequently grouped together with other non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC). Here, we performed an analysis of the clinical profile of patients with MCC in Poland to identify major factors influencing the prognosis. METHODS: Approximately 13,000 pathology and medical records were examined to identify patients with MCC diagnosed between 2010 and 2019. The management and outcomes of patients with histologically confirmed MCC were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients diagnosed with MCC were identified. The tumor occurred predominantly in women (61.3%) and in the elderly (mean 75.6 years). Twenty-nine patients had locoregional MCC and two had metastatic MCC at the time of diagnosis. Patients in stage I disease had excellent prognosis. In stages II and III, respectively 22.2% and 50.0% of patients developed metastases. Among patients who received chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide, 17% achieved partial remission with progression-free survival (PFS) of 8.0 months, and a further 50% achieved stable disease with PFS of 4.0, 4.5, and 4.5 months respectively. In 6 (19.4%) patients MCC coexisted with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In all six cases CLL preceded MCC development. CONCLUSIONS: Female gender, tumor-free resection margins, and local disease were found to be independent prognostic factors in MCC progression. Patients with hematological malignancies, immunosuppression, and those with immune deficiencies should be closely followed up as they are predisposed to develop MCC.","['Ciazynska, Magdalena', 'Szczepaniak, Katarzyna', 'Pabianek, Marta', 'Nejc, Dariusz', 'Reich, Adam', 'Ulanska, Malgorzata', 'Owczarek, Witold', 'Skibinska, Malgorzata', 'Narbutt, Joanna', 'Lesiak, Aleksandra']","['Ciazynska M', 'Szczepaniak K', 'Pabianek M', 'Nejc D', 'Reich A', 'Ulanska M', 'Owczarek W', 'Skibinska M', 'Narbutt J', 'Lesiak A']","['Department of Proliferative Diseases, Nicolaus Copernicus Multidisciplinary Centre for Oncology and Traumatology, Lodz, Poland. ciazynska.magdalena@gmail.com.', 'Department of Proliferative Diseases, Nicolaus Copernicus Multidisciplinary Centre for Oncology and Traumatology, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Proliferative Diseases, Nicolaus Copernicus Multidisciplinary Centre for Oncology and Traumatology, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology Chair of Oncology, Medical University in Lodz, Nicolaus Copernicus Multidisciplinary Centre for Oncology and Traumatology, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Rzeszow, Rzeszow, Poland.', 'Department of Proliferative Diseases, Nicolaus Copernicus Multidisciplinary Centre for Oncology and Traumatology, Lodz, Poland.', 'Dermatology Clinic, Military Institute of Medicine in Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Dermatology, Paediatric Dermatology and Oncology Clinic, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Dermatology, Paediatric Dermatology and Oncology Clinic, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Dermatology, Paediatric Dermatology and Oncology Clinic, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),Dermatology and therapy,101590450,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'Merkel cell carcinoma', 'Sentinel lymph node biopsy']",2020/07/13 06:00,2020/07/13 06:01,['2020/07/13 06:00'],"['2020/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/13 06:01 [medline]', '2020/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13555-020-00424-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s13555-020-00424-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Dermatol Ther (Heidelb). 2020 Oct;10(5):1003-1012. doi: 10.1007/s13555-020-00424-5.

However, the existence of a leukemia-like cancer in the softshell clam Mya arenaria provides an opportunity to re-evaluate the evolution of the genetic machinery of apoptosis. Here, we report the whole-genome sequence for M. arenaria which we leverage with existing data to test evolutionary hypotheses on the origins of apoptosis in animals. We show that the ancestral bilaterian p53 locus, a master regulator of apoptosis, possessed a complex domain structure, in contrast to that of extant ecdysozoan p53s. Further, ecdysozoan taxa, but not chordates or lophotrochozoans like M. arenaria, show a widespread reduction in apoptosis gene copy number. Finally, phylogenetic exploration of apoptosis gene copy number reveals a striking linkage with p53 domain complexity across species. Our results challenge the current understanding of the evolution of apoptosis and highlight the ancestral complexity of the bilaterian apoptotic tool kit and its subsequent dismantlement during the ecdysozoan radiation.","['Plachetzki, David C', 'Pankey, M Sabrina', 'MacManes, Matthew D', 'Lesser, Michael P', 'Walker, Charles W']","['Plachetzki DC', 'Pankey MS', 'MacManes MD', 'Lesser MP', 'Walker CW']","['Molecular, Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of New Hampshire.', 'Molecular, Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of New Hampshire.', 'Molecular, Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of New Hampshire.', 'Molecular, Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of New Hampshire.', 'School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering, University of New Hampshire.', 'Molecular, Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of New Hampshire.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Genome Biol Evol,Genome biology and evolution,101509707,,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', '*Genes, p53', '*Genome', 'Mya/*genetics', '*Phylogeny']",['NOTNLM'],"['* Mya', '*Ecdysozoa', '*apoptosis', '*gene family evolution', '*softshell clam']",2020/07/13 06:00,2021/09/09 06:00,['2020/07/13 06:00'],"['2020/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['5870378 [pii]', '10.1093/gbe/evaa143 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Biol Evol. 2020 Oct 1;12(10):1681-1693. doi: 10.1093/gbe/evaa143.,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

However, the prognostic impact of AS events remains under-explored in AML. Here we report the prognostic value of AS events and associated splicing factors based on three datasets of AML patients. We defined the landscape of AS events in AML and identified 7033 AS events associated with the survival of AML patients. Based on these events, we further developed a composite 15 AS event-based prognostic signature, which was independent of the cytogenetic risk stratification and patient age, and showed a better performance than known gene expression signatures. More importantly, our new signature markedly improved the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk classification, indicating a broad applicability in the clinical management of AML. Furthermore, the splicing-regulatory network established the correlations between prognostic AS events and associated splicing factors. The finding was validated by CRISPR-based data, which indicated that the increased expression of RBM39 contributed to the higher exon inclusion of SETD5 and conferred a poor outcome. Together, AS events may serve as a novel assortment of prognosticators for AML and could refine the ELN risk stratification. The splicing regulatory network provides clues regarding the splicing factor-mediated mechanisms of AML.","['Jin, Peng', 'Tan, Yun', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Li, Junmin', 'Wang, Kankan']","['Jin P', 'Tan Y', 'Zhang W', 'Li J', 'Wang K']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Sino-French Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, National Research Center for Translational Medicine at Shanghai, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China; Sino-French Research Center for Life Sciences and Genomics, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.

Based on Raman spectral analysis, we find that the action of Chidamide on Jurkat cell will lead to an addition of an acetyl group to a specific lysine residue at the end of histone amino acid, and greatly enhance the acetylation of histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, and then destroy the electrostatic force between the alkaline terminal of the positive charged arginine side chain and the negative charged DNA of phosphate group, finally cause the depolymerization of DNA and histone octamer in chromatin nucleosome depolymerization and the relaxation of chromatin. Accordingly, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the decreasing of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) are observed. For comparison, we also present the corresponding results of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and MS-275 inhibitors. The achieved results show that proliferation of Chidamide-treated Jurkat cells is low relative to MS-275 or SAHA, and the action of Chidamide or MS-275 on Jurkat cells lead to obvious increasing in histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, whereas the action effect of SAHA is mainly observed in histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3 but weak in histone H4. Moreover, it is found that Chidamide-induced histone H3 acetylation in Jurkat cells is stronger than MS-275 and SAHA. Collectively, by Raman spectral analysis, we achieve the dynamic behavior of biochemical components, molecular conformation and morphological changes of HDAC inhibitors-treated Jurkat cells. Importantly, our research is the first to demonstrate that the action site of HDAC inhibitors on Jurkat cell is located in the DNA minor groove. Most importantly, the application of Raman spectrum in exploring in-situ molecular changes information, histone acetylation modification in epigenetics, drug action sites and cell cycle affected by HDAC inhibitors will supply new idea and reference for the design and modification of HDAC inhibitors.","['Xie, Yue', 'Tang, Ping', 'Xing, Xinyue', 'Zhao, Yao', 'Cao, Shengqi', 'Liu, Shengde', 'Lu, Xiaoxu', 'Zhong, Liyun']","['Xie Y', 'Tang P', 'Xing X', 'Zhao Y', 'Cao S', 'Liu S', 'Lu X', 'Zhong L']","['Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China; Brain academy of South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510631, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nanophotonic Functional Materials and Devices, South China Normal University, Guangzhou 510006, China.

This article reports the conclusions of the second NDDS forum, which expanded across the Atlantic to further develop the initiative. Pre-clinical and clinical data for 40 genetic targets and mechanisms of action were prioritised and drugs were identified for early-phase trials. Strategies to develop drugs targeting TERT, telomere maintenance, ATRX, alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), BRIP1 and RRM2 as well as direct targeting of MYCN are high priority and should be championed for drug discovery. Promising pre-clinical data suggest that targeting of ALT by ATM or PARP inhibition may be potential strategies. Drugs targeting CDK2/9, CDK7, ATR and telomere maintenance should enter paediatric clinical development rapidly. Optimising the response to anti-GD2 by combinations with chemotherapy, targeted agents and other immunological targets are crucial. Delivering this strategy in the face of small patient cohorts, genomically defined subpopulations and a large number of permutations of combination trials, demands even greater international collaboration. In conclusion, the NDDS provides an internationally agreed, biologically driven selection of prioritised genetic targets and drugs. Improvements in the strategy for conducting trials in neuroblastoma will accelerate bringing these new drugs more rapidly to front-line therapy.","['Moreno, Lucas', 'Barone, Giuseppe', 'DuBois, Steven G', 'Molenaar, Jan', 'Fischer, Matthias', 'Schulte, Johannes', 'Eggert, Angelika', 'Schleiermacher, Gudrun', 'Speleman, Frank', 'Chesler, Louis', 'Geoerger, Birgit', 'Hogarty, Michael D', 'Irwin, Meredith S', 'Bird, Nick', 'Blanchard, Guy B', 'Buckland, Sean', 'Caron, Hubert', 'Davis, Susan', 'De Wilde, Bram', 'Deubzer, Hedwig E', 'Dolman, Emmy', 'Eilers, Martin', 'George, Rani E', 'George, Sally', 'Jaroslav, Sterba', 'Maris, John M', 'Marshall, Lynley', 'Merchant, Melinda', 'Mortimer, Peter', 'Owens, Cormac', 'Philpott, Anna', 'Poon, Evon', 'Shay, Jerry W', 'Tonelli, Roberto', 'Valteau-Couanet, Dominique', 'Vassal, Gilles', 'Park, Julie R', 'Pearson, Andrew D J']","['Moreno L', 'Barone G', 'DuBois SG', 'Molenaar J', 'Fischer M', 'Schulte J', 'Eggert A', 'Schleiermacher G', 'Speleman F', 'Chesler L', 'Geoerger B', 'Hogarty MD', 'Irwin MS', 'Bird N', 'Blanchard GB', 'Buckland S', 'Caron H', 'Davis S', 'De Wilde B', 'Deubzer HE', 'Dolman E', 'Eilers M', 'George RE', 'George S', 'Jaroslav S', 'Maris JM', 'Marshall L', 'Merchant M', 'Mortimer P', 'Owens C', 'Philpott A', 'Poon E', 'Shay JW', 'Tonelli R', 'Valteau-Couanet D', 'Vassal G', 'Park JR', 'Pearson ADJ']","[""Paediatric Haematology & Oncology Division, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain.

The dysfunction of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contributes to the formation of TAA. Previous research indicated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were involved in the development of TAA. This article aimed to explore the role of lncRNA hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha-antisense RNA 1 (HIF1A-AS1) and potential action mechanisms in VSMCs. METHODS: The expression of HIF1A-AS1, collagen I, collagen III, microRNA let-7g (let-7g) and apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1) was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cell proliferation and cell apoptosis were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometry assays, respectively. The protein levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Cleaved caspase-3 (Cleaved-cas3), B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), Collagen I, Collagen III, and APAF1 were quantified by Western blot. The relationship between let-7g and HIF1A-AS1 or APAF1 was predicted by the online bioinformatics tool and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA pull-down assay. RESULTS: HIF1A-AS1 was upregulated in TAA tissues and was a valuable diagnostic marker of TAA. HIF1A-AS1 overexpression suppressed proliferation, induced apoptosis, and reduced the expression of extracellular matrix proteins in VSMCs. let-7 g was a target of HIF1A-AS1, and its inhibition functioned the same role as HIF1A-AS1 overexpression. APAF1 was a target of let-7g, and its knockdown played the opposite role with HIF1A-AS1 overexpression. The reintroduction of let-7g or APAF1 knockdown reversed the effects of HIF1A-AS1 overexpression in VSMCs. CONCLUSIONS: HIF1A-AS1 regulated the proliferation, apoptosis ,and the activity of extracellular matrix proteins in VSMCs through modulating APAF1 by targeting let-7g, leading to the development of TAA.","['Zhang, Xin', 'Li, Hongwei', 'Guo, Xiaofeng', 'Hu, Jiting', 'Li, Bin']","['Zhang X', 'Li H', 'Guo X', 'Hu J', 'Li B']","['Department of Cardiac Surgery, Luoyang Central Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Luoyang, China.', 'Department of Cardiac Surgery, Luoyang Central Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Luoyang, China.', 'Department of Cardiac Surgery, Luoyang Central Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Luoyang, China.', 'Department of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Luoyang Central Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Luoyang, China.', 'Department of Cardiac Surgery, Luoyang Central Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Luoyang, China.

In this multicenter retrospective analysis of 157 patients, we compared the outcomes of patients with high-risk CLL treated with alloSCT, a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor (BCRi), and both. Seventy-one patients were treated with BCRis, 67 patients underwent reduced-intensity conditioning alloSCT, and 19 received alloSCT with a BCRi before and/or after transplantation. Inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses were performed to compare the alloSCT and no-alloSCT groups; in the 2 groups, 5-year OS, PFS, and cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and relapse were 40% versus 60% (P=.096), 34% versus 17% (P=.638), 28% versus 5% (P=.016), and 38% versus 83% (P=.005), respectively. Patients treated with alloSCT plus BCRi had a 3-year OS of 83%. The 3-year OS and NRM by year of alloSCT, including patients treated with BCRi, were 53% and 17% in 2000 to 2007, 55% and 30% in 2008 to 2012, and 72% and 18% in 2013 to 2018.

However, the use of human viruses is limited by the patients' antiviral immune response. In this study, we investigated an alternative oncolytic strategy using non-human pathogen viruses as the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) that were able to interact with CD46. METHODS: We treated several human myeloma cell lines and non-myeloma cell lines with BVDV to evaluate the expression of CD46 and to study the effect on cell viability by flow cytometry. The possible synergistic effect of bortezomib in combination with BVDV was also tested. Moreover, we infected the bone marrow mononuclear cells obtained from myeloma patients and we checked the BVDV effect on different cell populations, defined by CD138, CD14, CD3, CD19, and CD56 expression evaluated by flow cytometry. Finally, the in vivo BVDV effect was tested in NOD-SCID mice injected subcutaneously with myeloma cell lines. RESULTS: Human myeloma cells were selectively sensitive to BVDV treatment with an increase of cell death and, consequently, of apoptotic markers. Consistently, bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from myeloma patients treated with BVDV, showed a significant selective decrease of the percentage of viable CD138(+) cells. Interestingly, bortezomib pre-treatment significantly increased the cytotoxic effect of BVDV in myeloma cell lines with a synergistic effect. Finally, the in vitro data were confirmed in an in vivo myeloma mouse model showing that BVDV treatment significantly reduced the tumoral burden compared to the vehicle. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data indicate, for the first time, a direct oncolytic effect of the BVDV in human myeloma cells suggesting its possible use as novel alternative anti-myeloma virotherapy strategy.","['Marchica, Valentina', 'Franceschi, Valentina', 'Vescovini, Rosanna', 'Storti, Paola', 'Vicario, Emanuela', 'Toscani, Denise', 'Zorzoli, Alessia', 'Airoldi, Irma', 'Dalla Palma, Benedetta', 'Campanini, Nicoletta', 'Martella, Eugenia', 'Mancini, Cristina', 'Costa, Federica', 'Donofrio, Gaetano', 'Giuliani, Nicola']","['Marchica V', 'Franceschi V', 'Vescovini R', 'Storti P', 'Vicario E', 'Toscani D', 'Zorzoli A', 'Airoldi I', 'Dalla Palma B', 'Campanini N', 'Martella E', 'Mancini C', 'Costa F', 'Donofrio G', 'Giuliani N']","['Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medical-Veterinary Science, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Laboratory and Cell Therapy Center, IRCCS ""Istituto Giannina Gaslini"", Genoa, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Laboratory and Cell Therapy Center, IRCCS ""Istituto Giannina Gaslini"", Genoa, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Hematology, ""Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma"", Parma, Italy.', 'Pathology, ""Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma"", Parma, Italy.', 'Pathology, ""Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma"", Parma, Italy.', 'Pathology, ""Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma"", Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Medical-Veterinary Science, University of Parma, Parma, Italy. gaetano.donofrio@unipr.it.', 'Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy. nicola.giuliani@unipr.it.', 'Hematology, ""Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma"", Parma, Italy. nicola.giuliani@unipr.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD46 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Cofactor Protein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/drug effects/virology', 'Bortezomib/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', '*Diarrhea Viruses, Bovine Viral/physiology', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Bovine', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Membrane Cofactor Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology/*therapy', '*Oncolytic Virotherapy', '*Oncolytic Viruses/physiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bovine viral diarrhea virus', '*Multiple myeloma', '*Oncolytic virotherapy', '*Oncolytic virus']",2020/07/13 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2020/07/13 06:00'],"['2019/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-020-00919-w [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-020-00919-w [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2020 Jul 11;13(1):89. doi: 10.1186/s13045-020-00919-w.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3457-3774'],20200711,,,,PMC7353805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We collected information on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of a cohort of 29 children (16 female and 13 male; median age, 7 years [range, 0-16 years]) diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection while on chemotherapy/immunotherapy (n = 26), or after stem cell transplantation (n = 3) during the peak of the epidemic in Italy. These patients suffered from leukemia (n = 16), lymphoma (n = 3), solid tumors (n = 10), and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (n = 1). RESULTS: The course of the disease was mild in all cases, with only 12 children developing symptoms (pneumonia in 3 cases), and none needing intensive care. Fifteen patients were hospitalized, including 7 asymptomatic patients. Nine patients (including 5 with no symptoms) were given hydroxychloroquine, and 3 of them were also given lopinavir/ritonavir. Among the 26 patients on chemotherapy/immunotherapy, the treatment was suspended in 16 cases for a median of 26 days (range, 15-68 days), whereas 8 patients continued their chemotherapy and 2 had minor modifications to their treatment regimen. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to take a milder clinical course in children than in adults with cancer. Specific SARS-CoV-2 treatment seems unnecessary for most children. In light of our findings, and albeit with the necessary caution, we suggest avoiding major changes to planned anticancer treatments in pediatric patients acquiring COVID-19.","['Bisogno, Gianni', 'Provenzi, Massimo', 'Zama, Daniele', 'Tondo, Annalisa', 'Meazza, Cristina', 'Colombini, Antonella', 'Galaverna, Federica', 'Compagno, Francesca', 'Carraro, Francesca', 'De Santis, Raffaela', 'Meneghello, Linda', 'Baretta, Valentina', 'Cesaro, Simone']","['Bisogno G', 'Provenzi M', 'Zama D', 'Tondo A', 'Meazza C', 'Colombini A', 'Galaverna F', 'Compagno F', 'Carraro F', 'De Santis R', 'Meneghello L', 'Baretta V', 'Cesaro S']","[""Hematology Oncology Division, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Unit, Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Unit ""Lalla Seragnoli,"" Sant\' Orsola Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, A.

Current treatments have greatly increased remission rate, but relapse still occurs. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are required. Previously, using a conditional Cbfb-MYH11 knockin mouse model, we showed that Cbfb-MYH11 induces the expression of a cytokine receptor, IL1RL1. Treatment with IL-33, the only known ligand of IL1RL1, promotes leukemia cell survival in vitro. We further found that IL1RL1(+) cells survive better with chemotherapy than IL1RL1(-) population. However, the mechanism is not clear. Here, we show that IL-33 treatment decreased drug sensitivity in the human inv(16) AML cell line ME-1. By RT-PCR, we found that IL-33 increased the expression of IL-4 and IL-6 and led to the activation of both p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB. We also showed that IL-33 decreased apoptosis with increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Moreover, pre-treatment with MAPK inhibitor attenuated the phosphorylation of p38 enhanced by IL-33 and reversed the anti-apoptotic effect by IL-33. Taken together, our findings give news insights into the potential mechanism of the anti-apoptotic effect by IL-33/IL1RL1 axis in AML which will help in future drug development.","['Wang, Yiqian', 'Luo, Huanmin', 'Wei, Mengyi', 'Becker, Michelle', 'Hyde, R Katherine', 'Gong, Qing']","['Wang Y', 'Luo H', 'Wei M', 'Becker M', 'Hyde RK', 'Gong Q']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, GMU-GIBH Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Third Clinical School, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Nanshan School, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, GMU-GIBH Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China.

The present study was designed to explore some of these endpoints; i.e. the apoptosis as well as autophagy and their related signaling in several stabilized cell lines as well as human explant melanoma cells treated with flubendazole (FLU). FLU-induced mitotic catastrophe resulted in mitochondrial and caspase-dependent apoptosis, which occurred at various rates in all treated cells during 96 h of treatment. The process was characterized by enhanced transcriptional activity of TP53 and NF-kappaB as well as upregulated Noxa expression. Also, inactivation of Bcl-2, BclXL and Mcl-1 proteins by JNK mediated phosphorylation was observed. Although increased autophagic activity took place in treated cells too, no discernible functional linkage with ongoing cell death process was evidenced. Together these results advance our evidence over the effectiveness of FLU cytotoxicity-related killing of melanoma cells while calling for more extensive testing of melanoma samples as a prerequisite of further preclinical evaluation of FLU antineoplastic potential.","['Rudolf, K', 'Rudolf, E']","['Rudolf K', 'Rudolf E']","['Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Charles University, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Charles University, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.

Factor Xa displays functions beyond coagulation, exhibiting proinflammatory effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a direct FXa inhibitor protects from the endothelial dysfunction (ED) caused by uremia. METHODS: Macro (HUVEC) and microvascular (HMEC) endothelial cells (ECs) were exposed to serum from uremic patients or healthy donors, in absence and presence of apixaban (60 ng/ml). We evaluated changes in surface VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, intracellular eNOS, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and von Willebrand Factor (VWF) production by immunofluorescence, reactivity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) towards platelets, and intracellular signaling. RESULTS: ECs exposed to uremic serum triggered dysregulation of all the parameters. Presence of apixaban resulted in decreased expression of VCAM-1 (178 +/- 14 to 89 +/- 2% on HMEC and 324 +/- 71 to 142 +/- 25% on HUVEC) and ICAM-1 (388 +/- 60 to 111 +/- 10% on HMEC and 148 +/- 9% to 90 +/- 7% on HUVEC); increased eNOS (72 +/- 8% to 95 +/- 10% on HMEC); normalization of ROS levels (173 +/- 21 to 114 +/- 13% on HMEC and 165 +/- 14 to 127 +/- 7% on HUVEC); lower production of VWF (168 +/- 14 to 92 +/- 4% on HMEC and 151 +/- 22 to 99 +/- 11% on HUVEC); and decreased platelet adhesion onto ECM (134 +/- 22 to 93 +/- 23% on HMEC and 161 +/- 14 to 117 +/- 7% on HUVEC). Apixaban inhibited p38MAPK and p42/44 activation in HUVEC (139 +/- 15 to 48 +/- 15% and 411 +/- 66 to 177 +/- 57%, respectively) (p < 0.05 vs control for all parameters).

It was found that the strains did not differ by malondialdehyde concentration, but intracellular concentration of ROS in cells of the cyclophosphamide-resistant strain (P388/CP) was higher than in cells of the original (P388) and other studied strains (P388/Rub, P388/cPt). Nuclear localization of the transcription factor Nrf2 in cells of strain P388/CP attested to its constitutive activation. Enhanced relative expression of the GCLM gene was found in all studied drug-resistant strains; the expression of the GSR and GPX1 genes was increased only in cells of the cyclophosphamide-resistant strain. These findings suggest that the mechanism of resistance of strain P388/CP is associated with increased activity of glutathione metabolism that developed as a result of activation of the antioxidant response transcription factor Nrf2 against the background of high intracellular concentration of ROS.","['Balakina, A A', 'Raevskaya, T A', 'Pavlov, V S', 'Mumyatova, V A', 'Goncharova, S A', ""Terent'ev, A A""]","['Balakina AA', 'Raevskaya TA', 'Pavlov VS', 'Mumyatova VA', 'Goncharova SA', ""Terent'ev AA""]","['Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Chernogolovka, Moscow region, Russia. balakina@icp.ac.ru.', 'Scientific and Educational Center in Chernogolovka of Moscow Region State University, Mytishchi, Moscow region, Russia. balakina@icp.ac.ru.', 'Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Chernogolovka, Moscow region, Russia.', 'Institute of Problems of Chemical Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Chernogolovka, Moscow region, Russia.', 'M.

However, the efficacy of pan-RAF inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not previously been explored. In AML, the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (MAPK) pathway is one of the most aberrantly activated oncogenic pathways, but previous targeting of this pathway by MEK inhibitors has not proven effective in clinical trials. Here we show that pan-RAF inhibition, but not MEK inhibition, induced cell death in 29% of AML samples while being nontoxic toward healthy bone marrow cells. Mechanistically, pan-RAF inhibition downregulated MCL1 protein synthesis and induced apoptosis in cells dependent on MCL1 for their survival. Furthermore, the combination of a pan-RAF and a BCL2 inhibitor overcame resistance to either compound alone in AML cell lines, as well as synergized and induced long-term responses ex vivo in AML patient samples relapsed or refractory to azacitidine + venetoclax treatment. Together, our results indicate that pan-RAF inhibition, alone or in combination with BCL2 inhibition, is a promising treatment strategy for AML.","['Tambe, Mahesh', 'Karjalainen, Ella', 'Vaha-Koskela, Markus', 'Bulanova, Daria', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn T', 'Kontro, Mika', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Heckman, Caroline A', 'Wennerberg, Krister']","['Tambe M', 'Karjalainen E', 'Vaha-Koskela M', 'Bulanova D', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Kontro M', 'Porkka K', 'Heckman CA', 'Wennerberg K']","['Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Biotech Research & Innovation Centre (BRIC) and Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology (DanStem), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Centre for Cancer Biomarkers, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Internal Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology, Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Central Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. krister.wennerberg@bric.ku.dk.', 'Biotech Research & Innovation Centre (BRIC) and Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology (DanStem), University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. krister.wennerberg@bric.ku.dk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'raf Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2020/07/12 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/07/12 06:00'],"['2020/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0972-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0972-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Dec;34(12):3186-3196. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0972-0.

Quality control was performed, where studies with high risk of bias were excluded. Prediction models were first established using the RCTs, and then externally validated in the phase II and retrospective populations. Trial-level surrogacy analysis was conducted by correlating the logarithmic (log) hazard ratio (HR) for PFS or EFS and log HR for OS. Correlation analysis at treatment arm-level was performed between 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-year PFS or EFS rates and 5-year OS. The correlation was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient r in weighted linear regression, with weight equal to patient size. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the consistency of predictive model by leaving one subgroup of trials out at a time. Twenty-six phase III RCTs, 4 phase II trials and 47 retrospective studies were included. In trial-level surrogacy, PFS (r, 0.772; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.471-0.913) or EFS (r, 0.838; 95% CI, 0.625-0.938) were associated with OS. For rituximab immunochemotherapy treatment arms in RCTs, there was a linear correlation between 1 and 5-year PFS (r, 0.813-0.873) or EFS (r, 0.853-0.931) and 5-year OS. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated reasonable overall consistency. The correlation between PFS and OS was externally validated using independent phase II, and retrospective data (r, 0.795-0.897). We recommend PFS and EFS as earlier efficacy endpoints in patients with DLBCL primarily treated with rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy.","['Zhu, Jie', 'Yang, Yong', 'Tao, Jin', 'Wang, Shu-Lian', 'Chen, Bo', 'Dai, Jian-Rong', 'Hu, Chen', 'Qi, Shu-Nan', 'Li, Ye-Xiong']","['Zhu J', 'Yang Y', 'Tao J', 'Wang SL', 'Chen B', 'Dai JR', 'Hu C', 'Qi SN', 'Li YX']","['National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Beijing, P.R.

Only congress records were limited by date (January 1, 2012-March 6, 2020). Special attention was given to available data in hematologic malignancies; however, available safety data in any indication are reported.

We also provide insight into other forms of CIN, such as chromothripsis and chromoplexy. We evaluate how the tumor microenvironment can contribute to a further increase in chromosomal instability in myeloma cells. Lastly, we highlight the role of certain mutational signatures in leading to high mutation rate and genome instability in certain MM patients.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) regulates several features of cancers and cancer stem cells (CSCs) through binding to LIF receptor (LIFR). In this study, we investigated the consensus of LIF and LIFR immunization on the growth of mouse mammary tumors. For this purpose, mouse LIF and LIFR were designed as truncated proteins, expressed in E. coli and then injected to mice as individual and mixed antigens. The results showed the production of neutralizing antibodies and secretion of interferon-gamma and interleukin-2 in response to immunization. In continue, the immunized mice were subjected for tumor formation challenge by inoculation of the breast CSCs derived from MC4-L2 cells. Development of the breast tumors was observed in all the control mice, while the tumors appeared in 75% of animals in the LIF group. LIFR injection, individually or in combination with LIF, strongly inhibited the tumor growth to only 25% of the mice. Moreover, a delay in tumor appearance was observed in the immunized mice compared to the controls. Immunostaining of the tumor sections confirmed the expression of LIF and LIFR. In conclusion, LIF and LIFR might be effective targets for immunotherapy of the tumors that express these proteins.","['Ghanei, Zahra', 'Mehri, Nahid', 'Jamshidizad, Abbas', 'Joupari, Morteza Daliri', 'Shamsara, Mehdi']","['Ghanei Z', 'Mehri N', 'Jamshidizad A', 'Joupari MD', 'Shamsara M']","['Department of Animal Biotechnology, National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Animal Biotechnology, National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Animal Biotechnology, National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Animal Biotechnology, National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Animal Biotechnology, National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran. shamsa@nigeb.ac.ir.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/*genetics/immunology']",,,2020/07/12 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/07/12 06:00'],"['2019/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-68158-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-68158-0 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Jul 10;10(1):11465. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-68158-0.,,20200710,,,,PMC7351713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monocyte-derived macrophages (MOMF) exert distinct functions under pathologic conditions, and leukemia-associated macrophages (LAM) show considerable diversities in activation and functional phenotype. However, their origin and pathologic roles have not been well elucidated. Here we used wild-type and CCR2(-/-) mice to study the pathologic roles of monocyte-derived LAM in extramedullary tissues in models of Notch1-induced T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). MOMF existed in the resting liver and spleen. In the spleen, Ly6C(+) monocytes gave rise to the Ly6C(+) macrophage subset. Furthermore, an increase of monocyte-derived LAM, including the Ly6C(+) subset, was detected in the extramedullary tissues in leukemic mice. More monocyte-derived LAM, including Ly6C(+) LAM, was detected in the spleens of leukemic mice transplanted with exogeneous mononuclear cells. Moreover, Ly6C(+) LAM exhibited increased M1-related characteristics and contributed to sterile inflammation. In CCR2(-/-) leukemic mice, reduced Ly6C(+) LAM, relieved sterile inflammation, and reduced distribution of leukemia cells were detected in extramedullary tissues. In addition, monocyte-derived Ly6C(+) LAM expressed high levels of CCL8 and CCL9/10. Blocking CCR1 and CCR2 relieved hepatosplenomegaly and inhibited the extramedullary distribution of leukemia cells in T-ALL mice. Collectively, our findings reveal the multifaceted pathologic roles of monocyte-derived LAM in T-ALL progression. SIGNIFICANCE: This study links monocyte-derived leukemia-associated macrophages with noninfectious inflammation and extramedullary distribution of leukemia cells during leukemia progression, providing new insight into macrophage-based immunotherapy in leukemia.","['Yang, Feifei', 'Feng, Wenli', 'Wang, Hao', 'Wang, Lina', 'Liu, Xiaoli', 'Wang, Rong', 'Chen, Chong', 'Yang, Xiao', 'Zhang, Dongyue', 'Ren, Qian', 'Zheng, Guoguang']","['Yang F', 'Feng W', 'Wang H', 'Wang L', 'Liu X', 'Wang R', 'Chen C', 'Yang X', 'Zhang D', 'Ren Q', 'Zheng G']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China. zhengggtjchn@aliyun.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Macrophages/*immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*pathology']",,,2020/07/12 06:00,2021/01/12 06:00,['2020/07/12 06:00'],"['2020/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-20-0034 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-0034 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2020 Sep 1;80(17):3677-3691. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-0034.

There is evidence that leukemic stem cells (LSC) interact with stem cell niches and outcompete hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). The impact of this interaction on the clinical course of the disease remains poorly understood. We developed and validated a mathematical model of stem cell competition in the human HSC niche. Model simulations predicted how processes in the stem cell niche affect the speed of disease progression. Combining the mathematical model with data of individual patients, we quantified the selective pressure LSCs exert on HSCs and demonstrated the model's prognostic significance. A novel model-based risk-stratification approach allowed extraction of prognostic information from counts of healthy and malignant cells at the time of diagnosis. This model's feasibility was demonstrable based on a cohort of patients with ALDH-rare AML and shows that the model-based risk stratification is an independent predictor of disease-free and overall survival. This proof-of-concept study shows how model-based interpretation of patient data can improve prognostic scoring and contribute to personalized medicine.

PRC2 trimethylates lysine 27 of histone H3 proteins (H3K27me3) as a chromatin modification associated with repressed transcription of genes frequently involved in cell proliferation or self-renewal. Loss-of-function mutations in the PRC2 core subunit SUZ12 have been identified in a variety of tumors, including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). To determine the consequences of SUZ12 loss in the pathogenesis of MPNST and other cancers, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt the open reading frame of each of two orthologous suz12 genes in zebrafish: suz12a and suz12b We generated these knockout alleles in the germline of our previously described p53 (also known as tp53)- and nf1-deficient zebrafish model of MPNSTs. Loss of suz12 significantly accelerated the onset and increased the penetrance of MPNSTs compared to that in control zebrafish. Moreover, in suz12-deficient zebrafish, we detected additional types of tumors besides MPNSTs, including leukemia with histological characteristics of lymphoid malignancies, soft tissue sarcoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which were not detected in p53/nf1-deficient control fish, and are also contained in the human spectrum of SUZ12-deficient malignancies identified in the AACR Genie database. The suz12-knockout tumors displayed reduced or abolished H3K27me3 epigenetic marks and upregulation of gene sets reported to be targeted by PRC2. Thus, these zebrafish lines with inactivation of suz12 in combination with loss of p53/nf1 provide a model of human MPNSTs and multiple other tumor types, which will be useful for mechanistic studies of molecular pathogenesis and targeted therapy with small molecule inhibitors.","['Oppel, Felix', 'Ki, Dong H', 'Zimmerman, Mark W', 'Ross, Kenneth N', 'Tao, Ting', 'Shi, Hui', 'He, Shuning', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Oppel F', 'Ki DH', 'Zimmerman MW', 'Ross KN', 'Tao T', 'Shi H', 'He S', 'Aster JC', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA thomas_look@dfci.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Dis Model Mech,Disease models & mechanisms,101483332,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (tp53 protein, zebrafish)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'DNA Methylation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neurofibromin 1/deficiency/*genetics', 'Neurofibrosarcoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Sarcoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/*genetics', 'Zebrafish/*genetics/metabolism', 'Zebrafish Proteins/deficiency/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Leukemia', '*MPNST', '*NF1', '*RAS signaling', '*SUZ12', '*p53']",2020/07/12 06:00,2021/08/24 06:00,['2020/07/12 06:00'],"['2019/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['dmm.042341 [pii]', '10.1242/dmm.042341 [doi]']",epublish,Dis Model Mech. 2020 Aug 27;13(8). pii: dmm.042341. doi: 10.1242/dmm.042341.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1011-1954', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1723-8520', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7851-8617']",20200827,,['(c) 2020.

We aimed to evaluate experiences with health care and HRQL of patients with HMs and the association between these patient-reported measures. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in two public oncology hospitals in Mexico City. The study included outpatient cancer patients aged >/=18 years with a diagnosis of leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. We used a patient-centered quality of cancer care questionnaire to assess patient experiences with receiving 1) timely care; 2) clear information; 3) information for treatment decision-making; 4) care to address biopsychosocial needs; and 5) respectful and coordinated care. We applied the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) to measure HRQL. We performed a multiple linear regression to evaluate the association between patient-reported experiences (independent variables) and the QLQ-C30 summary score (dependent variable). RESULTS: Of the 515 participating HM patients, 46.6% had lymphoma, 34% leukemia, and 19.4% multiple myeloma; 70.9% were at advanced stages or at high risk. Additionally, 15.1% had anxiety and 12.8% had depression. Over one third (35.9%) reported receiving clear information, 28.5% timely care, 20.6% information for treatment decision-making, 23.7% care that addressed their biopsychosocial needs, and 31% respectful and coordinated care. The mean QLQ-C30 summary score was 71.9 points. Timely care, clear information, and care that addresses biopsychosocial needs were associated with higher HRQL. CONCLUSIONS: Health care services for HM patients at public oncology hospitals in Mexico need improvement. Notably, providing timely care, clear information, and care that addresses patients' biopsychosocial needs can increase the likelihood of better HRQL. Health care providers should measure and improve the experiences of HM patients with health care.","['Doubova, Svetlana V', 'Terreros-Munoz, Eduardo', 'Delgado-Lopez, Nancy', 'Montano-Figueroa, Efreen Horacio', 'Infante-Castaneda, Claudia', 'Perez-Cuevas, Ricardo']","['Doubova SV', 'Terreros-Munoz E', 'Delgado-Lopez N', 'Montano-Figueroa EH', 'Infante-Castaneda C', 'Perez-Cuevas R']","['Epidemiology and Health Services Research Unit CMN Siglo XXI, Mexican Institute of Social Security, Av.

Given logistic and toxicity-related challenges, identifying subgroups appropriate for this approach is an unmet need. Using data from two centers, we retrospectively compared event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of AML and MDS patients who received AZA maintenance (n = 59) with historic controls (n = 90). Controls were selected according to the following criteria: no death, relapse, or Grade III-IV acute GVHD for 100 days after transplant. In multivariable analysis, AZA maintenance yielded significantly improved EFS (p = 0.019) and OS (p = 0.011). Outcomes differed according to regimen intensity. For reduced-intensity transplant, EFS (p = 0.004) and OS (p = 0.004) were significantly improved and equivalent to myeloablative transplant. A significant benefit following myeloablative transplant was not observed. Within the limitation of its retrospective nature, this study suggests that AZA maintenance improves outcomes following reduced-intensity HCT, comparable to myeloablative HCT.","['Ali, Naveed', 'Tomlinson, Benjamin', 'Metheny, Leland', 'Goldstein, Steven C', 'Fu, Pingfu', 'Cao, Shufen', 'Caimi, Paolo', 'Patel, Rushang D', 'Varela, Juan Carlos', 'Andrade, Luisa', 'Balls, Jason W', 'Baer, Linda', 'Smith, Megan', 'Smith, Tori', 'Nelson, Megan', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Mori, Shahram']","['Ali N', 'Tomlinson B', 'Metheny L', 'Goldstein SC', 'Fu P', 'Cao S', 'Caimi P', 'Patel RD', 'Varela JC', 'Andrade L', 'Balls JW', 'Baer L', 'Smith M', 'Smith T', 'Nelson M', 'de Lima M', 'Mori S']","['Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals of Cleveland Seidman Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals of Cleveland Seidman Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals of Cleveland Seidman Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplant, AdventHealth Hospital, Orlando, FL, USA.', 'Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals of Cleveland Seidman Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplant, AdventHealth Hospital, Orlando, FL, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplant, AdventHealth Hospital, Orlando, FL, USA.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals of Cleveland Seidman Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplant, AdventHealth Hospital, Orlando, FL, USA.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals of Cleveland Seidman Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplant, AdventHealth Hospital, Orlando, FL, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplant, AdventHealth Hospital, Orlando, FL, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplant, AdventHealth Hospital, Orlando, FL, USA.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Program, University Hospitals of Cleveland Seidman Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplant, AdventHealth Hospital, Orlando, FL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/adverse effects', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Myeloablative Agonists', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Azacitidine maintenance', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*myelodysplastic syndrome']",2020/07/12 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/07/12 06:00'],"['2020/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1789630 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Dec;61(12):2839-2849. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1789630.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) across 23 transplantation centers in China. Patients ages 40-60 years with standard-risk hematologic malignancies with an HLA-matched sibling donor were randomly assigned to an ATG group (4.5 mg/kg thymoglobulin plus cyclosporine [CsA], methotrexate [MTX], and mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]) and a control group (CsA, MTX, and MMF). The primary end point of this study was grade 2-4 aGVHD on day 100. RESULTS: From November 2013 to April 2018, 263 patients were enrolled. The cumulative incidence rate of grade 2-4 aGVHD was significantly reduced in the ATG group (13.7%; 95% CI, 13.5% to 13.9%) compared with the control group (27.0%; 95% CI, 26.7% to 27.3%; P = .007). The ATG group had significantly lower incidences of 2-year overall chronic GVHD (27.9% [95% CI, 27.6% to 28.2%] v 52.5% [95% CI, 52.1% to 52.9%]; P < .001) and 2-year extensive chronic GVHD (8.5% [95% CI, 8.4% to 8.6%] v 23.2% [95% CI, 22.9% to 23.5%]; P = .029) than the control group. There were no differences between the ATG and control groups with regard to cytomegalovirus reactivation, Epstein-Barr virus reactivation, 3-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM), 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), 3-year overall survival, or 3-year leukemia-free survival. Three-year GVHD relapse-free survival was significantly improved in the ATG group (38.7%; 95% CI, 29.9% to 47.5%) compared with the control group (24.5%; 95% CI, 16.9% to 32.1%; P = .003). CONCLUSION: Our study is the first prospective RCT in our knowledge to demonstrate that ATG can effectively decrease the incidence of aGVHD after MSDT in the CsA era without affecting the CIR or NRM.","['Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Wu, De-Pei', 'Lai, Yong-Rong', 'Liu, Qi-Fa', 'Sun, Yu-Qian', 'Hu, Jiong', 'Hu, Yu', 'Zhou, Jian-Feng', 'Li, Juan', 'Wang, Shun-Qing', 'Li, Wei', 'Du, Xin', 'Lin, Dong-Jun', 'Ren, Han-Yun', 'Chen, Fang-Pin', 'Li, Yu-Hua', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Huang, He', 'Song, Yong-Ping', 'Jiang, Ming', 'Hu, Jian-Da', 'Liang, Ying-Min', 'Wang, Jing-Bo', 'Xiao, Yang', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Chang YJ', 'Wu DP', 'Lai YR', 'Liu QF', 'Sun YQ', 'Hu J', 'Hu Y', 'Zhou JF', 'Li J', 'Wang SQ', 'Li W', 'Du X', 'Lin DJ', 'Ren HY', 'Chen FP', 'Li YH', 'Zhang X', 'Huang H', 'Song YP', 'Jiang M', 'Hu JD', 'Liang YM', 'Wang JB', 'Xiao Y', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, and Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China."", 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Nanfang Hospital Affiliated to Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, and Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China."", 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Department of Hematology, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Union Hospital Affiliated With Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China."", 'The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Guangdong General Hospital, Guangzhou, China.', 'Third Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Xinqiao Hospital Affiliated to Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China.', 'The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University and Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, China.', 'Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, China.', ""Tangdu Hospital Air Force Medical University, Xi'an, China."", 'Aerospace Center Hospital, Beijing, China.', ""Southern Theater General Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Guangzhou, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, and Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Siblings', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",,,2020/07/12 06:00,2021/03/05 06:00,['2020/07/12 06:00'],"['2020/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.20.00150 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 Oct 10;38(29):3367-3376. doi: 10.1200/JCO.20.00150.

Here, we report that the extracellular miR-122 from hepatic cells can be delivered to hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to modulate their proliferation and gene expression. Our published Argonaute crosslinking immunoprecipitation (Ago-CLIP) data identified several pro-fibrotic genes, including Ctgf, as miR-122 targets in mice livers. However, treating Ctgf as a therapeutic target failed to rescue the fibrosis developed in the miR-122 knockout livers. Alternatively, we compared the published datasets of human cirrhotic livers and miR-122 KO livers, which revealed upregulation of BCL2, suggesting its potential role in regulating fibrosis. Notably, ectopic miR-122 expression inhibited BCL2 expression in human HSC (LX-2) cells). Publicly available ChIP-seq data in human hepatocellular cancer (HepG2) cells and mice livers suggested miR-122 could regulate BCL2 expression indirectly through c-MYC, which was confirmed by siRNA-mediated depletion of c-MYC in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Importantly, Venetoclax, a potent BCL2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of leukemia, showed promising anti-fibrotic effects in miR-122 knockout mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that miR-122 suppresses liver fibrosis and implicates anti-fibrotic potential of Venetoclax.","['Teng, Kun-Yu', 'Barajas, Juan M', 'Hu, Peng', 'Jacob, Samson T', 'Ghoshal, Kalpana']","['Teng KY', 'Barajas JM', 'Hu P', 'Jacob ST', 'Ghoshal K']","['Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Biology (Basel),Biology,101587988,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL2', 'Venetoclax', 'hepatic stellate cell (HSC)', 'liver fibrosis', 'microRNA-122 (miR-122)']",2020/07/12 06:00,2020/07/12 06:01,['2020/07/12 06:00'],"['2020/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/12 06:01 [medline]']","['biology9070157 [pii]', '10.3390/biology9070157 [doi]']",epublish,Biology (Basel). 2020 Jul 8;9(7). pii: biology9070157. doi: 10.3390/biology9070157.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1315-3247'],20200708,,,"['R01 CA086978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA086978/Foundation for the National Institutes of Health', 'R01CA193244/Foundation for the National Institutes of Health', 'R01 DK088076/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA193244/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7408427,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the 1-benzyl-3,5-bis((E)-3-bromobenzylidene)piperidin-4-one 3 displayed dual p300/EZH2 inhibition joined to cancer-selective cell death in a panel of tumor cells and in in vivo xenograft models, we prepared a series of bis((E)-2-bromobenzylidene) cyclic compounds 4a-n to test in biochemical (p300, PCAF, SIRT1/2, EZH2, and CARM1) and cellular (NB4, U937, MCF-7, SH-SY5Y) assays. The majority of 4a-n exhibited potent dual p300 and CARM1 inhibition, sometimes reaching the submicromolar level, and induction of apoptosis mainly in the tested leukemia cell lines. The most effective compounds in both enzyme and cellular assays carried a 4-piperidone moiety and a methyl (4d), benzyl (4e), or acyl (4k-m) substituent at N1 position.

As a surrogate for immunopeptidome diversity, the HLA evolutionary divergence (HED) between individual HLA alleles might directly define the ability to present TAAs, a prerequisite for graft-versus-leukemia effects. We therefore analyzed the impact of HED on survival within a cohort of 171 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients after matched donor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Low HED (<25th percentile) of HLA class I (HED(class I)) or HLA-DR antigens (HED(DR)) was a strong determinant for adverse overall survival after allogeneic HSCT (OS), with a hazard ratio for death of 1.9 (95% CI 1.2-3.2) and 2.1 (95% CI 1.3-3.4), respectively. Defining a cutoff value for the combined HED(total) (HED(class I) and HED(DR)), the respective 5 year OS was 29.7% and 64.9% in patients with low and high HED(total) (p < 0.001), respectively. Furthermore, the risk of relapse was significantly higher in patients with low HED(total) (hazard ratio (HR) 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.6) and event-free survival (EFS) was significantly reduced (5 year EFS 25.7% versus 54.4%, p < 0.001).

Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic core component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is responsible for gene silencing through trimethylation of H3K27. EZH2 dysregulation is highly tumorigenic and has been observed in various cancers, with EZH2 acting as an oncogene or a tumor-suppressor depending on cellular context. While loss-of-function mutations of EZH2 frequently affect patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, myelodysplastic syndrome and myelofibrosis, cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) seem to be largely characterized by EZH2 overexpression. A variety of other factors frequently aberrant in myeloid leukemia can affect PRC2 function and disease pathogenesis, including Additional Sex Combs Like 1 (ASXL1) and splicing gene mutations. As the genetic background of myeloid malignancies is largely heterogeneous, it is not surprising that EZH2 mutations act in conjunction with other aberrations. Since EZH2 mutations are considered to be early events in disease pathogenesis, they are of therapeutic interest to researchers, though targeting of EZH2 loss-of-function does present unique challenges. Preliminary research indicates that combined tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and EZH2 inhibitor therapy may provide a strategy to eliminate the residual disease burden in CML to allow patients to remain in treatment-free remission.","['Rinke, Jenny', 'Chase, Andrew', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Ernst, Thomas']","['Rinke J', 'Chase A', 'Cross NCP', 'Hochhaus A', 'Ernst T']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, 07743 Jena, Germany.', 'School of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury SP2 8BJ, UK.', 'School of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury SP2 8BJ, UK.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, 07743 Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Universitatsklinikum Jena, 07743 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ASXL1', '*CML', '*EZH2', '*MDS', '*MPN', '*PRC2', '*mutations', '*myeloid malignancies']",2020/07/12 06:00,2021/04/13 06:00,['2020/07/12 06:00'],"['2020/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9071639 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9071639 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Jul 8;9(7). pii: cells9071639. doi: 10.3390/cells9071639.,,20200708,,,,PMC7407223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanism of CNSL is unclear at present. Thus, determining appropriate prevention and therapeutic strategies for CNSL remain challenging. Currently, inferences regarding gene functions are based on the measurement of average gene expression in a bulk lysate. However, leukemia cells are a heterogeneous population in which the expression of critical genes may be masked by many unrelated genes. Single-cell sequencing may therefore be the best way to explore the development of CNSL in the bone marrow and peripheral blood at diagnosis and subsequent time points, in order to detect potential targets and prevent the development of CNSL.

Because only approximately 20% of African Americans will have an HLA-matched unrelated donor, many of these patients undergo HLA-haploidentical relative or umbilical cord blood transplantation. In this study, we analyzed outcomes after HLA-haploidentical related donor (n = 249) and umbilical cord blood (n = 118) transplantations in African American patients with hematologic malignancy between 2008 and 2016. The predominant disease was acute myelogenous leukemia for recipients of both types of donor grafts. The incidences of grade II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease were higher after umbilical cord blood transplantation compared with HLA-haploidentical relative transplantation (56% and 29%, respectively, versus 33% and 11%, respectively; P < .0001). The 2-year incidence of transplantation-related mortality adjusted for age and conditioning regimen intensity was higher after umbilical cord blood transplantation compared with HLA-haploidentical related donor transplantation (31% versus 18%; P = .008); however, there were no between-group differences in the 2-year adjusted incidence of relapse (30% versus 34%; P = .51), overall survival (54% versus 57%; P = .66), or disease-free survival (43% versus 47%; P = .46). Our findings show that the use of HLA-haploidentical and umbilical cord blood transplants expands the access to transplantation with comparable leukemia-free and overall survival for African Americans with hematologic malignancies.","['Solomon, Scott R', 'Martin, Andrew St', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Ballen, Karen', 'Bashey, Asad', 'Battiwalla, Minoo', 'Baxter-Lowe, Lee Ann', 'Brunstein, Claudio', 'Chhabra, Saurabh', 'Perez, Miguel Angel Diaz', 'Fuchs, Ephraim J', 'Ganguly, Siddhartha', 'Hardy, Nancy', 'Hematti, Peiman', 'McGuirk, Joseph', 'Peres, Edward', 'Ringden, Olle', 'Rizzieri, David', 'Romee, Rizwan', 'Solh, Melhem', 'Szwajcer, David', 'van der Poel, Marjolein', 'Waller, Edmund', 'William, Basem M', 'Eapen, Mary']","['Solomon SR', 'Martin AS', 'Zhang MJ', 'Ballen K', 'Bashey A', 'Battiwalla M', 'Baxter-Lowe LA', 'Brunstein C', 'Chhabra S', 'Perez MAD', 'Fuchs EJ', 'Ganguly S', 'Hardy N', 'Hematti P', 'McGuirk J', 'Peres E', 'Ringden O', 'Rizzieri D', 'Romee R', 'Solh M', 'Szwajcer D', 'van der Poel M', 'Waller E', 'William BM', 'Eapen M']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Northside Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Division of Biostatics, Institute for Heath and Equity, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Program, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Northside Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Sarah Cannon BMT Center at Centennial Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.', ""Division of Research Immunology, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Minnesota Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Stem Cell Transplant and Cellular Therapy Program, Henry Ford Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Kansas Health System, Kansas City, Kansas.', 'BMT Program, Greenebaum Cancer Center University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Program, University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, Madison, Wisconsin.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Kansas Health System, Kansas City, Kansas.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Henry Ford Hospital Bone and Marrow Transplant Program, Detroit, Michigan.', 'Translational Cell Therapy Research Group, CLINTEC, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Division of Cell Therapy, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Northside Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Cancer Care Manitoba, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Maastricht University Medical Centre, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Division of Hematology, Ohio State University James Cancer Hospital, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Disease progression in patients with CLL continues to occur, however. In particular, 3% to 25% of patients treated with a novel agent develop Richter transformation (RT); that is, histologic transformation of CLL to an aggressive lymphoma, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). RT that develops in the novel agent era is frequently associated with adverse molecular alterations, such as TP53 disruption and complex karyotype. As a result, patients with RT in the era of novel agents typically have poor responses to the traditional chemotherapy used to treat de novo DLBCL. These patients also tend to have poor survival outcomes, with a median overall survival of less than 1 year. In this article, we review the contemporary literature of RT, particularly in the context of novel agents used for CLL, and discuss the management approach of RT in the novel agent era.","['Wang, Yucai', 'Ding, Wei']","['Wang Y', 'Ding W']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['*Abnormal Karyotype', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Survival Rate', '*Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",,,2020/07/11 06:00,2021/01/09 06:00,['2020/07/11 06:00'],"['2020/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2020 Jun;18(6):348-357.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we describe how fluorizoline induces BCL-2 homology 3-only protein NOXA, without modulating the protein levels of anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family members prior to caspase activation, as well as how it synergizes with the BCL-2 and BCL-XL inhibitor ABT-737 to induce apoptosis. Interestingly, fluorizolinetreatment triggers the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) in HeLa and HAP1 cells, with increased eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha phosphorylation, and induction of ATF3, ATF4, and CHOP. Moreover, PHB downregulation induces similar ISR activation and apoptosis as with fluorizoline treatment. In addition, we studied the essential role of the pro-apoptotic protein NOXA in fluorizoline-induced apoptosis and we describe its mechanism of induction in HeLa and HAP1 cells. Moreover, we identified ATF3 and ATF4 as the transcription factors that bind to NOXA promoter upon fluorizoline treatment. Furthermore, using ATF3 and ATF4 CRISPR HeLa and HAP1 cells, we confirmed that both factors mediate the induction of NOXA and apoptosis by fluorizoline. In conclusion, fluorizoline treatment triggers the activation of the ISR that results in the induction of ATF3 and ATF4, important regulators of NOXA transcription in fluorizoline-induced apoptosis.","['Nunez-Vazquez, Sonia', 'Sanchez-Vera, Ismael', 'Saura-Esteller, Jose', 'Cosialls, Ana M', 'Noisier, Anais F M', 'Albericio, Fernando', 'Lavilla, Rodolfo', 'Pons, Gabriel', 'Iglesias-Serret, Daniel', 'Gil, Joan']","['Nunez-Vazquez S', 'Sanchez-Vera I', 'Saura-Esteller J', 'Cosialls AM', 'Noisier AFM', 'Albericio F', 'Lavilla R', 'Pons G', 'Iglesias-Serret D', 'Gil J']","[""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques, Facultat de Medicina i Ciencies de la Salut, Oncobell-IDIBELL (Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge), L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques, Facultat de Medicina i Ciencies de la Salut, Oncobell-IDIBELL (Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge), L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques, Facultat de Medicina i Ciencies de la Salut, Oncobell-IDIBELL (Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge), L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques, Facultat de Medicina i Ciencies de la Salut, Oncobell-IDIBELL (Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge), L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Laboratory of Medical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy and Food Sciences and Institute of Medicine (IBUB), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CIBER-BBN, Networking Centre on Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine, Department of Organic Chemistry, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Medical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy and Food Sciences and Institute of Medicine (IBUB), University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques, Facultat de Medicina i Ciencies de la Salut, Oncobell-IDIBELL (Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge), L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques, Facultat de Medicina i Ciencies de la Salut, Oncobell-IDIBELL (Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge), L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Facultat de Medicina, Universitat de Vic - Universitat Central de Catalunya (UVic-UCC), Vic, Spain.', ""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques, Facultat de Medicina i Ciencies de la Salut, Oncobell-IDIBELL (Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge), L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (ATF3 protein, human)', '0 (ATF4 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 3)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (PHB protein, human)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Prohibitins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '145891-90-3 (Activating Transcription Factor 4)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 3/*genetics/metabolism', 'Activating Transcription Factor 4/*genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Prohibitins', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ATF', '*ISR', '*NOXA', '*apoptosis', '*fluorizoline', '*prohibitins']",2020/07/11 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2020/07/11 06:00'],"['2020/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/febs.15480 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2021 Feb;288(4):1271-1285. doi: 10.1111/febs.15480.

The problems like target non-specificity and toxicity are well-known regarding anticancer drugs. Therefore, target specific search of novel entities is constant. Isothymusin is a dimethoxy, trihydroxy flavone present in plants like Ocimum sanctum, and Limnophilla geoffrayi. There are limited reports available on the anticancer potential of isothymusin. OBJECTIVES: The effects of isothymusin on redox status, cell cytotoxicity, and targets involved in the promotion and progression of the cancer cells have been investigated. METHODS: Antiproliferative efficacy was evaluated by MTT, Neutral Red Uptake, and Sulforhodamine-B assays. The spectrophotometric methods were adopted to study the effect against selected targets. Redox activity was assessed by in vitro antioxidant assays and the interaction study, ADMET profiling, and toxicity assessments were done in silico. RESULTS: Isothymusin scavenges the radicals, i.e., DPPH and nitric oxide with moderate ferric reducing potential. It affected the proliferation of leukemia, colon, skin, and breast cancer cell lines by more than 50% but moderately affected prostate, kidney, lung, hepatic, and breast adenocarcinoma (up to 48%). Isothymusin inhibited the enzymes associated with the promotion stage of cancer, including cycloxygenase- 2 and lipoxygenase-5. Additionally, it also inhibited the activity of proliferation markers like cathepsin- D, dihydrofolate reductase, hyaluronidase, and ornithine-decarboxylase. Besides, in silico studies supported the in vitro enzyme inhibition assays outcome. Toxicity studies showed promising results of chemical descriptors and non-skin-irritant, moderate ocular-irritancy, and in vitro Ames test confirmed non-mutagenic nature. CONCLUSION: Isothymusin showed radical scavenging and anti-proliferative activities, which may be taken up as a phytochemical lead for the synthesis of analogues possessing enhanced anticancer potential.","['Singh, Shilpi', 'Kumari, Priyanka', 'Hussain, Yusuf', 'Luqman, Suaib', 'Meena, Abha', 'Kanaojia, Deepika']","['Singh S', 'Kumari P', 'Hussain Y', 'Luqman S', 'Meena A', 'Kanaojia D']","['Molecular Bioprospection Department of Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Molecular Bioprospection Department of Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Molecular Bioprospection Department of Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Molecular Bioprospection Department of Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Molecular Bioprospection Department of Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, Uttar Pradesh, India.', 'Molecular Bioprospection Department of Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, Uttar Pradesh, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United Arab Emirates,Curr Top Med Chem,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,101119673,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Picrates)', '98755-25-0 (isothymusin)', 'DFD3H4VGDH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flavonoids/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Picrates/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",['NOTNLM'],"['Antiproliferative', 'Cancer', 'DPPH', 'Isothymusin', 'MTT', 'Nitric oxide']",2020/07/11 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2020/07/11 06:00'],"['2019/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['CTMC-EPUB-108037 [pii]', '10.2174/1568026620666200710103636 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Top Med Chem. 2020;20(21):1898-1909. doi: 10.2174/1568026620666200710103636.,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In neural stem cells, Notch signaling inhibits differentiation by activating HES1 expression. Therefore, Notch signaling inhibitors may be candidates for new anticancer drugs or have applications in neural regenerative medicine. In this study, six naturally occurring Notch inhibitors were isolated from the methanol (MeOH) extract of Lansium domesticum using our novel cell-based assay. Hongherin (2), a cardiac glycoside, demonstrated potent Notch inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 0.62 muM and was found to be cytotoxic in HPB-ALL human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Hongherin (2) also induced the differentiation of C17.2 neural stem cells to neurons, causing a 65% increase in differentiation compared to the control. Mechanistically, hongherin (2) reduced the amount of Notch1 (full length) and mastermind-like protein (MAML). This indicates that hongherin (2) inhibits Notch signaling through a dual mechanism involving the reduction of both Notch1 and MAML protein levels.","['Tsuchiya, Anna', 'Makita, Yoshinori', 'Koyano, Takashi', 'Kowithayakorn, Thaworn', 'Ishibashi, Masami', 'Arai, Midori A']","['Tsuchiya A', 'Makita Y', 'Koyano T', 'Kowithayakorn T', 'Ishibashi M', 'Arai MA']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba, 260-8675, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba, 260-8675, Japan.', 'Temko Corporation, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Faculty of Agriculture, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba, 260-8675, Japan. mish@chiba-u.jp.', 'Department of Biosciences and Informatics, Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Kohoku-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, 223-8522, Japan. midori_arai@bio.keio.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Nat Med,Journal of natural medicines,101518405,"['0 (Cardenolides)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Cardenolides/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Plants/*chemistry', 'Receptors, Notch/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['Differentiation', 'Inhibitor', 'Natural products', 'Notch signaling']",2020/07/11 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2020/07/11 06:00'],"['2020/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11418-020-01432-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s11418-020-01432-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Nat Med. 2020 Sep;74(4):758-766. doi: 10.1007/s11418-020-01432-7.

Artesunate (Art), a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin, is commonly used as an antimalarial drug and has been proven to possess anticancer potential. Methods: In this study, the effect of Art on the proliferation and stemness of human acute promyelocyte leukemia HL-60 cells and acute myeloid leukemia KG1a cells was investigated. Flow cytometry, colony formation assay, the protein expressive levels of survivin, P21, cleaved caspase 3, Bax, Bcl-2, Ki67 were detected the effect of Art on HL-60 and KG1a cells proliferation and apoptosis. At the same time, cell sphere formation assay and the protein expressive levels of CD44, SOX2, ALDH1 and OCT4 were used to analyze the effects of Art on cancer stem cell-like property in vitro. The orthotopic xenograft mouse models were established by using KG1a cells in BALB/c athymic nude mice. Tumor weigh was detected. The protein levels of survivin and Ki67 were detected by immunohistochemistry assays. Results: Art induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation and stemness in a dose-dependent manner. In the meantime, the results exhibited that Art inhibited the growth and stemness of transplanted tumors via the suppression of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathway. Conclusions: Our present study provides new insights into the mechanisms of Art's anticancer potential in leukemia.","['Chen, Shengmei', 'Gan, Silin', 'Han, Lijie', 'Li, Xue', 'Xie, Xiaoqing', 'Zou, Dianbin', 'Sun, Hui']","['Chen S', 'Gan S', 'Han L', 'Li X', 'Xie X', 'Zou D', 'Sun H']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Artesunate', 'apoptosis', 'leukemia', 'proliferation', 'stemness', 'tumorigenesis']",2020/07/11 06:00,2020/07/11 06:01,['2020/07/11 06:00'],"['2020/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm-20-4558 [doi]', 'atm-08-12-767 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2020 Jun;8(12):767. doi: 10.21037/atm-20-4558.,,,,['2020 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Complementary medication such as music therapy is needed to overcome the increase in cortisol levels. We conducted this study to determine the effect of music therapy on salivary cortisol levels in children with leukaemia undergoing IV-line insertion. Method: This was a pre-experimental study with a pre- and post-test design. We analysed the salivary cortisol levels in 30 children with leukaemia undergoing IV-Line insertion from January until February 2018. Music was played using earphones after the completion of the IV-line insertion procedure. The salivary cortisol levels were analysed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Changes in cortisol levels were considered clinically significant if the differences were >/=0.05 ng/ml. The Wilcoxon test was used to test the effect of music therapy on cortisol levels and a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result: Levels of cortisol before and after the music therapy had a median (min-max) of 4.14 (0.25-9.89) and 3.47 (0.16-15.31), respectively. The median difference of cortisol levels was 0.67 ng/ml. This change of >/=0.05 ng/ml indicates the clinical effect of music therapy on cortisol levels. Though the music therapy did not significantly affect salivary cortisol levels (p = 0.99), this study revealed the clinical effect of music therapy in reducing cortisol levels. Conclusions: This study did not indicate a statistically significant effect of music therapy on cortisol levels of children with leukaemia during an IV-line insertion. However, the study findings reflect the clinical effect of music therapy in reducing cortisol levels.","['Hasanah, Idyatul', 'Mulatsih, Sri', 'Haryanti, Fitri', 'Haikal, Zikrul']","['Hasanah I', 'Mulatsih S', 'Haryanti F', 'Haikal Z']","['Department of Nursing, Mataram Institute of Health Science, Mataram, Indonesia.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology Paediatrics, Paediatric Department, Faculty of Medicine, Public Health and Nursing, Universitas Gadjah Mada/Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.', 'Department of Paediatric Nursing, Faculty of Medicine, Public Health and Nursing, Universitas Gadjah Mada/Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Mataram, Mataram, Indonesia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,J Taibah Univ Med Sci,Journal of Taibah University Medical Sciences,101621911,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cortisol', 'Leukaemia', 'Music therapy', 'Stress']",2020/07/11 06:00,2020/07/11 06:01,['2020/07/11 06:00'],"['2020/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jtumed.2020.03.007 [doi]', 'S1658-3612(20)30042-1 [pii]']",epublish,J Taibah Univ Med Sci. 2020 Apr 14;15(3):238-243. doi: 10.1016/j.jtumed.2020.03.007. eCollection 2020 Jun.,,20200414,,['(c) 2020 The Authors.'],,PMC7336003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is sufficient published data describing toxicities of high dose MTX (HD-MTX), but toxicities with escalating doses of MTX (Capizzi regimen) is not well documented. Capizzi regimen is thought to be relatively safe; we contend that even low escalating doses of MTX have significant toxicities. Our study intends to characterise such events with Capizzi MTX in comparison to that seen with HD-MTX. The retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary care centre of North India. We looked for the presence of six main toxicities: febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, hepatic toxicity, renal toxicity and skin toxicity from the clinical records of children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma (intermediate and high risk disease), treated at our centre from November 2013 to July 2018. Intermediate risk ALL (IR-ALL) received Capizzi MTX, whereas high risk ALL (HR-ALL/T-NHL), received HD-MTX. Both these regimens do not use L-asparaginase. A total of 237 cycles of Capizzi escalating MTX and 151 cycles of HD-MTX (B cell: 3 gm/m(2) and T cell ALL/T-NHL: 5 gm/m(2)) during interim maintenance were studied in 93 children. Fifty-four (54) children were of IR (all B cell ALL) and 39 of HR-ALL (21 B-ALL, 18 T-ALL/T-NHL). The combined incidence of toxicities, were similar between the two groups: 68/237 cycles (28.7%) of Capizzi MTX and 45/151 cycles (29.8%) of HD-MTX (P = 0.815). However, mucositis was more commonly witnessed in the later group at 22/151 cycle (14.6%) versus 13/237 cycles (5.5%) in Capizzi MTX (P = 0.002). Nephrotoxicity and skin toxicity was seen only in the HD-MTX group. There was no difference in the severity of toxicity, graded using NCI CTCAE v 5.0, between the two groups. There was no mortality directly attributable to methotrexate toxicity (Grade V toxicity). Serum MTX levels were available in 69/151 (45.7%) cycles of HD-MTX and showed no association with toxicity in this group. Also, there was no difference in the incidence of combined toxicities between groups with (19/69 cycles) or without (26/82 cycles) available serum MTX levels in the HR group (P = 0.577). Male gender, lower baseline ANC and lower BMI had significant association with toxicity. Methotrexate related toxicity is common with both Capizzi and HD-MTX schedule in childhood ALL with a correlation of lower BMI, baseline ANC and male gender. However, it is possible to administer Capizzi as well as HD-MTX in lower middle income countries, with manageable toxicity. Further studies will be required to substantiate our findings and determine the predictors of such events.","['Mandal, Piali', 'Samaddar, Sukla', 'Chandra, Jagdish', 'Parakh, Nupur', 'Goel, Manish']","['Mandal P', 'Samaddar S', 'Chandra J', 'Parakh N', 'Goel M']","[""Division of Hematoncology, Department of Pediatrics, Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, India.grid.497270.f0000 0004 1767 7210"", ""Division of Hematoncology, Department of Pediatrics, Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, India.grid.497270.f0000 0004 1767 7210"", ""Division of Hematoncology, Department of Pediatrics, Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, India.grid.497270.f0000 0004 1767 7210"", ""Division of Hematoncology, Department of Pediatrics, Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, India.grid.497270.f0000 0004 1767 7210"", 'Department of Community Medicine, Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, India.grid.415723.6']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Capizzi interim maintenance', 'High dose methotrexate', 'Methotrexate toxicity', 'Serum methotrexate levels']",2020/07/11 06:00,2020/07/11 06:01,['2020/07/11 06:00'],"['2019/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-019-01245-z [doi]', '1245 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2020 Jul;36(3):498-504. doi: 10.1007/s12288-019-01245-z.

However, resistance presents a considerable limit to its efficacy. Currently, it is impossible to anticipate IM resistance which makes the recognition of early flags an important treatment goal in CML. In this work we studied the connection between microRNA 30a (miR-30a) and Beclin 1 mediated autophagy and IM resistance in Egyptian CML patients. The study included newly diagnosed (group I, n = 20), imatinib responder (group II, n = 30), imatinib resistant (group III, n = 30) CML patients and a healthy demographically matched control group (group IV, n = 20). miR-30a expression was assayed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The variation in expression of miR-30a between CML cases and healthy controls was calculated using relative quantification method (2(-DeltaDeltaCT)). Beclin 1 was assayed in Peripheral blood mononuclear cells by western blotting. miR-30a was over expressed and Beclin 1 was under expressed in imatinib responders compared to resistant cases median 1.21(0.55-3.02) versus median 0.65 (0.03-1.0) (p = 0.001) and median 950.0 (400.0-2410.0) versus, median 1570.0 (920.0-5430.0) (p < 0.001) respectively. Beclin 1 correlated significantly positively with miR-30a in new cases (p = 0.001) and negatively in imatinib responders (p = 0.021). Receiver Operating Curves demonstrated the performances of miR-30a and Beclin 1 to detect imatinib resistance. They showed sensitivities of 97.14% and 94.29% and specificities of 53.33% and 42.22% at the cut-off values of 1 and 940 respectively. Both miR-30a and Beclin 1 levels showed a relation with imatinib response and can therefore be put forward as valuable markers for detection of resistance and may also have promising future therapeutic implications.","['Khalil, Nehal A', 'Desouky, Mohammed N', 'Diab, Iman H', 'Hamed, Nahla A M', 'Mannaa, Hazem F']","['Khalil NA', 'Desouky MN', 'Diab IH', 'Hamed NAM', 'Mannaa HF']","['Medical Biochemistry Department, Mowasah Medical Campus, Alexandria Faculty of Medicine, Main University Hospital, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Medical Biochemistry Department, Mowasah Medical Campus, Alexandria Faculty of Medicine, Main University Hospital, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Medical Biochemistry Department, Mowasah Medical Campus, Alexandria Faculty of Medicine, Main University Hospital, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Hematology Department, Alexandria Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Medical Biochemistry Department, Mowasah Medical Campus, Alexandria Faculty of Medicine, Main University Hospital, Alexandria, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Beclin 1', 'Imatinib', 'MicroRNA 30a']",2020/07/11 06:00,2020/07/11 06:01,['2020/07/11 06:00'],"['2019/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-019-01241-3 [doi]', '1241 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2020 Jul;36(3):491-497. doi: 10.1007/s12288-019-01241-3.

T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3) is known as a biomarker of AML LSCs. Several microRNAs (miRNAs) can affect gene expression in AML. In this study, the silencing effect of miR-133a-5p on TIM-3 expression in AML cell lineage (HL-60) was investigated. It's been hypothesized that miR-133a-5p may suppress the TIM-3 expression in AML cell line. Initially, miRNA-TIM-3 prediction, enrichment, and network analysis were done. Then, miR-133a-5p mimic was transfected into HL-60 cells. The TIM-3 protein and gene expression were measured by flow cytometry analysis and real-time PCR, respectively. MTT assay was also carried out. Based on the Bioinformatics predictions, miR-133a-5p was able to silence TIM-3 expression. Also, significant pathways pertained to miR-133a-5p were obtained using enrichment analysis. According to this, miR-133a-5p was mainly engaged in the MAPK signaling pathway and Nicotine addiction pathway using the KEGG database. The TIM-3 protein expression of the transfected cells was measured as 17.15 +/- 8.87% (p = 0.001). A 52.48% significant gene silencing in mRNA level was obtained in comparison to the negative control. Despite of down regulation of TIM-3, HL-60 cell viability has not been significantly changed. It has been finally confirmed that miR-133a-5p could strongly suppress TIM-3 expression in AML cell line.

Hence, patients with CLL might be considered more susceptible to severe complications from COVID-19. We undertook this retrospective international multicenter study to characterize the course of COVID-19 in patients with CLL and identify potential predictors of outcome. Of 190 patients with CLL and confirmed COVID-19 diagnosed between 28/03/2020 and 22/05/2020, 151 (79%) presented with severe COVID-19 (need of oxygen and/or intensive care admission). Severe COVID-19 was associated with more advanced age (>/=65 years) (odds ratio 3.72 [95% CI 1.79-7.71]). Only 60 patients (39.7%) with severe COVID-19 were receiving or had recent (</=12 months) treatment for CLL at the time of COVID-19 versus 30/39 (76.9%) patients with mild disease. Hospitalization rate for severe COVID-19 was lower (p < 0.05) for patients on ibrutinib versus those on other regimens or off treatment. Of 151 patients with severe disease, 55 (36.4%) succumbed versus only 1/38 (2.6%) with mild disease; age and comorbidities did not impact on mortality. In CLL, (1) COVID-19 severity increases with age; (2) antileukemic treatment (particularly BTK inhibitors) appears to exert a protective effect; (3) age and comorbidities did not impact on mortality, alluding to a relevant role of CLL and immunodeficiency.","['Scarfo, Lydia', 'Chatzikonstantinou, Thomas', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Quaresmini, Giulia', 'Motta, Marina', 'Vitale, Candida', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose Antonio', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jose Angel', 'Miras, Fatima', 'Baile, Monica', 'Marquet, Juan', 'Niemann, Carsten U', 'Reda, Gianluigi', 'Munir, Talha', 'Gimeno, Eva', 'Marchetti, Monia', 'Quaglia, Francesca Maria', 'Varettoni, Marzia', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Iyengar, Sunil', 'Janssens, Ann', 'Marasca, Roberto', 'Ferrari, Angela', 'Cuellar-Garcia, Carolina', 'Itchaki, Gilad', 'Spacek, Martin', 'De Paoli, Lorenzo', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Levin, Mark-David', 'Lista, Enrico', 'Mauro, Francesca R', 'Simkovic, Martin', 'Van Der Spek, Ellen', 'Vandenberghe, Elisabeth', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Wasik-Szczepanek, Ewa', 'Ruchlemer, Rosa', 'Bron, Dominique', 'De Paolis, Maria Rosaria', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Farina, Lucia', 'Foglietta, Myriam', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Herishanu, Yair', 'Herold, Tobias', 'Jaksic, Ozren', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Kersting, Sabina', 'Malerba, Lara', 'Orsucci, Lorella', 'Popov, Viola Maria', 'Sportoletti, Paolo', 'Yassin, Mohamed', 'Pocali, Barbara', 'Barna, Gabor', 'Chiarenza, Annalisa', 'Dos Santos, Gimena', 'Nikitin, Eugene', 'Andres, Martin', 'Dimou, Maria', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Enrico, Alicia', 'Hakobyan, Yervand', 'Kalashnikova, Olga', 'Ortiz Pareja, Macarena', 'Papaioannou, Maria', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Shah, Nimish', 'Shrestha, Amit', 'Stanca, Oana', 'Stavroyianni, Niki', 'Strugov, Vladimir', 'Tam, Constantine', 'Zdrenghea, Mihnea', 'Coscia, Marta', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Rossi, Giuseppe', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', ""Montserrat, Emili'"", 'Foa, Robin', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Scarfo L', 'Chatzikonstantinou T', 'Rigolin GM', 'Quaresmini G', 'Motta M', 'Vitale C', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Hernandez-Rivas JA', 'Miras F', 'Baile M', 'Marquet J', 'Niemann CU', 'Reda G', 'Munir T', 'Gimeno E', 'Marchetti M', 'Quaglia FM', 'Varettoni M', 'Delgado J', 'Iyengar S', 'Janssens A', 'Marasca R', 'Ferrari A', 'Cuellar-Garcia C', 'Itchaki G', 'Spacek M', 'De Paoli L', 'Laurenti L', 'Levin MD', 'Lista E', 'Mauro FR', 'Simkovic M', 'Van Der Spek E', 'Vandenberghe E', 'Trentin L', 'Wasik-Szczepanek E', 'Ruchlemer R', 'Bron D', 'De Paolis MR', 'Del Poeta G', 'Farina L', 'Foglietta M', 'Gentile M', 'Herishanu Y', 'Herold T', 'Jaksic O', 'Kater AP', 'Kersting S', 'Malerba L', 'Orsucci L', 'Popov VM', 'Sportoletti P', 'Yassin M', 'Pocali B', 'Barna G', 'Chiarenza A', 'Dos Santos G', 'Nikitin E', 'Andres M', 'Dimou M', 'Doubek M', 'Enrico A', 'Hakobyan Y', 'Kalashnikova O', 'Ortiz Pareja M', 'Papaioannou M', 'Rossi D', 'Shah N', 'Shrestha A', 'Stanca O', 'Stavroyianni N', 'Strugov V', 'Tam C', 'Zdrenghea M', 'Coscia M', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Rossi G', 'Rambaldi A', 'Montserrat E', 'Foa R', 'Cuneo A', 'Ghia P']","['Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele and IRCC Ospedale San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology Department and HCT Unit, G.

Constitutive activation of the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway in MF leads to cell proliferation, inhibition of cell death, and clonal expansion of myeloproliferative malignant cells. Fedratinib is a selective oral JAK2 inhibitor recently approved in the United States for treatment of adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF. In mouse models of JAK2V617F-driven myeloproliferative disease, fedratinib blocked phosphorylation of STAT5, increased survival, and improved MF-associated disease features, including reduction of white blood cell counts, hematocrit, splenomegaly, and fibrosis. Fedratinib exerts off-target inhibitory activity against bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4); combination JAK/STAT and BRD4 inhibition was shown to synergistically block NF-kB hyperactivation and inflammatory cytokine production, attenuating disease burden and reversing bone marrow fibrosis in animal models of MPNs. In patients, fedratinib is rapidly absorbed and dosed once daily (effective half-life 41 h). Fedratinib showed robust clinical activity in JAK-inhibitor-naive patients and in patients with MF who were relapsed, refractory, or intolerant to prior ruxolitinib therapy. Fedratinib is effective regardless of JAK2 mutation status. Onset of spleen and symptom responses are typically seen within the first 1-2 months of treatment. The most common adverse events (AEs) with fedratinib are grades 1-2 gastrointestinal events, which are most frequent during early treatment and decrease over time. Treatment discontinuation due to hematologic AEs in clinical trials was uncommon (~3%). Suspected cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy were reported during fedratinib trials in ~1% of patients; thiamine levels should be monitored before and during fedratinib treatment as medically indicated. Phase III trials are ongoing to assess fedratinib effects on long-term safety, efficacy, and overall survival. The recent approval of fedratinib provides a much-needed addition to the limited therapeutic options available for patients with MF.","['Talpaz, Moshe', 'Kiladjian, Jean-Jacques']","['Talpaz M', 'Kiladjian JJ']","['University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. mtalpaz@umich.edu.', 'Hopital Saint-Louis, Universite de Paris, Inserm, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Janus Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '6L1XP550I6 (Fedratinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications/diagnosis', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*etiology/metabolism', 'Pyrrolidines/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Sulfonamides/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2020/07/11 06:00,2021/01/14 06:00,['2020/07/11 06:00'],"['2020/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0954-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0954-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2021 Jan;35(1):1-17. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0954-2.

Although advances in treatment have greatly improved survival rates in young patients, in the elderly population, ~70% of patients present poor prognosis. A pan-cancer analysis on the TCGA cohort showed that AML has the second higher HUWE1 expression in tumor samples among all cancer types. In addition, pathway enrichment analysis pointed to RAS signaling cascade as one of the most important pathways associated to HUWE1 expression in this particular AML cohort. In silico analysis for biological processes enrichment also revealed that HUWE1 expression is correlated with 13 genes involved in myeloid differentiation. Therefore, to understand the role of HUWE1 in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) we constitutively expressed KRAS(G12V) oncogene concomitantly to HUWE1 knockdown in stromal co-cultures. The results showed that, in the context of KRAS(G12V), HUWE1 significantly reduces cell cumulative growth and changes myeloid differentiation profile of HSPCs. Overall, these observations suggest that HUWE1 might contribute to leukemic cell proliferation and impact myeloid differentiation of human HSCs, thus providing new venues for RAS-driven leukemia targeted therapy approach.","['Ruckert, Mariana Tannus', 'Brouwers-Vos, Annet Z', 'Nagano, Luis Fernando P', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob', 'Silveira, Vanessa Silva']","['Ruckert MT', 'Brouwers-Vos AZ', 'Nagano LFP', 'Schuringa JJ', 'Silveira VS']","['Department of Genetics, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Genetics, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Genetics, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil. vsilveira@fmrp.usp.br.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (HUWE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",,,2020/07/11 06:00,2021/08/19 06:00,['2020/07/11 06:00'],"['2020/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41417-020-0198-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41417-020-0198-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2020 Nov;27(10-11):830-833. doi: 10.1038/s41417-020-0198-3.

Broadening standard eligibility criteria may increase clinical trial participation. In this retrospective single-center analysis, we identified 442 consecutive newly diagnosed patients from 2014 to 2016. Patients were considered eligible if they had performance status 0-2, normal renal and hepatic function, no recent solid tumor, left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) >/= 50%, and no history of congestive heart failure (CHF) or myocardial infarction (MI); ineligible patients failed to meet one or more of these criteria. We included 372 patients who received chemotherapy. Ineligible patients represented 40% of the population and had a 1-79-fold greater risk of death (95% CI 1.37, 2.33) than eligible patients. Very few patients had cardiac co-morbidities, including 2% with low EF, 4% with prior CHF, and 5% with prior MI. In multivariable analysis, ineligibility was associated with decreased survival [HR 1-44 (95% CI 1-07, 1-93)]. Allogeneic transplantation, performed in 150 patients (40%), was associated with improved survival [HR 0-66, 95% CI (0-48, 0-91)]. Therefore, standard eligibility characteristics identify a patient population with improved survival. Further treatment options are needed for patients considered ineligible for clinical trials.","['Percival, Mary-Elizabeth M', 'Othus, Megan', 'Mirahsani, Sarah', 'Gardner, Kelda M', 'Shaw, Carole', 'Halpern, Anna B', 'Becker, Pamela S', 'Hendrie, Paul C', 'Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Walter, Roland B', 'Estey, Elihu H']","['Percival MM', 'Othus M', 'Mirahsani S', 'Gardner KM', 'Shaw C', 'Halpern AB', 'Becker PS', 'Hendrie PC', 'Sorror ML', 'Walter RB', 'Estey EH']","['University of Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'University of Washington.', 'University of Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'University of Washington.', 'University of Washington.', 'University of Washington.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'University of Washington.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['*Heart Failure/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stroke Volume', 'Ventricular Function, Left']",,,2020/07/11 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2020/07/11 06:00'],"['2020/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2020.254938 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2020.254938 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Aug 1;106(8):2114-2120. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.254938.,,20210801,,,['P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC8327712,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus far, the genetic background has remained unknown. Among 726 children consecutively diagnosed with BCP-ALL, 8% patients experienced switch detectable by flow cytometry (FC). Using exome and RNA sequencing, switch was found to positively correlate with three different genetic subtypes: PAX5-P80R mutation (5 cases with switch out of 5), rearranged DUX4 (DUX4r; 30 cases of 41) and rearranged ZNF384 (ZNF384r; 4 cases of 10). Expression profiles or phenotypic patterns correlated with genotypes, but within each genotype they could not identify cases who subsequently switched. If switching was not taken into account, the B-cell-oriented FC assessment underestimated the minimal residual disease level. For patients with PAX5-P80R, a discordance between FC-determined and PCR-determined MRD was found on day 15, resulting from a rapid loss of the B-cell phenotype. Discordance on day 33 was observed in all the DUX4r, PAX5-P80R and ZNF384r subtypes. Importantly, despite the substantial phenotypic changes, possibly even challenging the appropriateness of BCP-ALL therapy, the monocytic switch was not associated with a higher incidence of relapse and poorer prognosis in patients undergoing standard ALL treatment.","['Novakova, Michaela', 'Zaliova, Marketa', 'Fiser, Karel', 'Vakrmanova, Barbora', 'Slamova, Lucie', 'Musilova, Alena', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Ritgen, Matthias', 'Fronkova, Eva', 'Kalina, Tomas', 'Stary, Jan', 'Winkowska, Lucie', 'Svec, Peter', 'Kolenova, Alexandra', 'Stuchly, Jan', 'Zuna, Jan', 'Trka, Jan', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Mejstrikova, Ester']","['Novakova M', 'Zaliova M', 'Fiser K', 'Vakrmanova B', 'Slamova L', 'Musilova A', 'Bruggemann M', 'Ritgen M', 'Fronkova E', 'Kalina T', 'Stary J', 'Winkowska L', 'Svec P', 'Kolenova A', 'Stuchly J', 'Zuna J', 'Trka J', 'Hrusak O', 'Mejstrikova E']","['CLIP-Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, University Hospital Motol, Charles University, Czech Rep.', 'CLIP-Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'CLIP-Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, University Hospital Motol, Charles University, Czech Rep.', 'CLIP-Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Comenius University, National Institute of Children Diseases, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Comenius University, National Institute of Children Diseases, Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'CLIP-Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP-Dpt.of Paediatric Haematology/Oncology, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics', '*Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma']",,,2020/07/11 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2020/07/11 06:00'],"['2020/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2020.250423 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2020.250423 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Aug 1;106(8):2066-2075. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2020.250423.,,20210801,,,,PMC8327733,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have reported the clinical course of 34 adult patients with r/r B-ALL receiving blinatumomab or inotuzumab ozogamicin at our institution from 2009 to 2019. RESULTS: Blinatumomab-based salvage therapy was applied for overt r/r B-ALL (n = 13) or minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity (n = 5). Of the 13 patients with r/r B-ALL, 9 (69%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 39%-91%) achieved complete remission (CR), with 78% of CR patients (95% CI, 40%-97%) reaching MRD negativity. MRD negativity was also achieved in all 5 patients treated for MRD positivity. The 1-year overall survival of patients receiving blinatumomab for r/r B-ALL and MRD positivity was 54% (n = 13; 95% CI, 26%-81%) and 80% (n = 5; 95% CI, 44-100), respectively. In the inotuzumab ozogamicin group, all 16 patients were treated for overt r/r B-ALL. The rate of CR was 94% (95% CI, 70%-100%), with 67% (95% CI, 38%-88%) of CR patients reaching MRD negativity. The 1-year OS after the first application of inotuzumab ozogamicin was 46% (95% CI, 18%-74%). Of those patients receiving blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin as a bridge-to-transplant strategy, 79% and 80%, respectively, proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The most frequent drug-specific adverse events were similar to those previously reported, including cytokine release syndrome, capillary leak syndrome, and neurotoxicity for blinatumomab and transplant-associated veno-occlusive disease of the liver for inotuzumab ozogamicin. CONCLUSION: Together with previous observations from phase III clinical trials, these data suggest that blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin are highly effective salvage regimens in r/r B-ALL.","['Stelmach, Patrick', 'Wethmar, Klaus', 'Groth, Christoph', 'Wenge, Daniela V', 'Albring, Jorn', 'Mikesch, Jan-Henrik', 'Schliemann, Christoph', 'Reicherts, Christian', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Lenz, Georg', 'Stelljes, Matthias']","['Stelmach P', 'Wethmar K', 'Groth C', 'Wenge DV', 'Albring J', 'Mikesch JH', 'Schliemann C', 'Reicherts C', 'Berdel WE', 'Lenz G', 'Stelljes M']","['Department of Medicine A - Hematology, Hemostaseology, Oncology, Pulmonology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A - Hematology, Hemostaseology, Oncology, Pulmonology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A - Hematology, Hemostaseology, Oncology, Pulmonology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A - Hematology, Hemostaseology, Oncology, Pulmonology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A - Hematology, Hemostaseology, Oncology, Pulmonology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A - Hematology, Hemostaseology, Oncology, Pulmonology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A - Hematology, Hemostaseology, Oncology, Pulmonology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A - Hematology, Hemostaseology, Oncology, Pulmonology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A - Hematology, Hemostaseology, Oncology, Pulmonology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A - Hematology, Hemostaseology, Oncology, Pulmonology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A - Hematology, Hemostaseology, Oncology, Pulmonology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany.

Inducing proliferation of preexisting beta cells is an approach to increase the numbers of beta cells. In this study, we examined a panel of selected small molecules for their proliferation-inducing effects on human pancreatic beta cells. Our results demonstrated that a small molecule inhibitor of the menin-MLL interaction (MI-2) and small molecule inhibitors of TGF-beta signaling (SB431542, LY2157299, or LY364947) synergistically increased ex vivo replication of human beta cells. We showed that this increased proliferation did not affect insulin production, as a pivotal indication of beta cell function. We further provided evidence which suggested that menin-MLL and TGF-beta inhibition cooperated through downregulation of cell cycle inhibitors CDKN1A, CDKN1B, and CDKN2C.

In this study we investigated the degradation of venetoclax under various stress conditions including acidic, basic, oxidative, photolytic and thermolytic conditions. We isolated and identified six of its main degradation products produced in forced degradation studies. The structures of the isolated degradation products were determined by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Additionally, one oxidation degradation product was identified with comparison to a commercially obtained venetoclax impurity. We proposed the key degradation pathways of venetoclax in solution. To the best of our knowledge, no structures of degradation products of venetoclax have been previously published. The study provides novel and primary knowledge of the stability characteristics of venetoclax under stress conditions. Venetoclax is currently the only BCL-2 protein inhibitor on the market. In addition to single agent treatment, it is effective in combinational therapy, so future drug development involving venetoclax can be expected. A better insight into the stability properties of the therapeutic can facilitate future studies involving venetoclax and aid in the search of new similar therapeutics.","['Zigart, Nina', 'Crnugelj, Martin', 'Ilas, Janez', 'Casar, Zdenko']","['Zigart N', 'Crnugelj M', 'Ilas J', 'Casar Z']","['Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d., Sandoz Development Center Slovenia, Analytics Department, SI-1526 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, Askerceva cesta 7, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d., Sandoz Development Center Slovenia, Analytics Department, SI-1526 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, Askerceva cesta 7, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d., Sandoz Development Center Slovenia, Analytics Department, SI-1526 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, Askerceva cesta 7, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Pharmaceutics,Pharmaceutics,101534003,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['degradation', 'stability', 'stress testing', 'venetoclax']",2020/07/11 06:00,2020/07/11 06:01,['2020/07/11 06:00'],"['2020/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/11 06:01 [medline]']","['pharmaceutics12070639 [pii]', '10.3390/pharmaceutics12070639 [doi]']",epublish,Pharmaceutics. 2020 Jul 7;12(7). pii: pharmaceutics12070639. doi: 10.3390/pharmaceutics12070639.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-0124-0474', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6689-3353']",20200707,,,,PMC7407384,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based upon nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared (IR), and mass spectra (HRMS), the structure of the obtained products was elucidated. X-ray structure analysis was also used as unambiguous tool to elucidate the structure of the products. The target compounds 3a-f were screened against 60 cancer cell lines. They displayed anticancer activity against a leukemia subpanel, namely, RPMI-8226 and SR cell lines. The activity of compound 3a was found as the most cytotoxic potency against 60 cancer cell lines. Consequently, it was selected for further five doses analysis according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) protocol. The cytotoxic effect showed selectivity ratios ranging between 0.63 and 1.28 and between 0.58 and 5.89 at the GI50 and total growth inhibition (TGI) levels, respectively. Accordingly, compound 3a underwent further mechanistic study against the most sensitive leukemia RPMI-8226 and SR cell lines. It showed antiproliferation with IC50 = 1.61 +/- 0.04 and 1.11 +/- 0.03 microM against RPMI-8226 and SR cell lines, respectively. It also revealed a remarkable tubulin inhibitory activity, compared to colchicine with IC50 = 4.97 microM/mL. Caspase-3, BAX, and Bcl-2 assays for 3a using annexin V-FITC staining revealed significant pro-apoptotic activity. Furthermore, multidrug-resistant leukemia SR cells were used to show better resistance indices (1.285 ng/mL, 1.15-fold) than the reference. Docking studies with beta-tubulin indicate that most of the tested compounds illustrated good binding at the colchicine binding site of the enzyme, especially for compound 3a, which made several interactions better than that of the reference colchicine.","['Aly, Ashraf A', 'Brase, Stefan', 'Hassan, Alaa A', 'Mohamed, Nasr K', 'Abd El-Haleem, Lamiaa E', 'Nieger, Martin', 'Morsy, Nesrin M', 'Abdelhafez, Elshimaa M N']","['Aly AA', 'Brase S', 'Hassan AA', 'Mohamed NK', 'Abd El-Haleem LE', 'Nieger M', 'Morsy NM', 'Abdelhafez EMN']","['Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Minia University, 61519-El-Minia, Egypt.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.', 'Institute of Biological and Chemical Systems-Functional Molecular Systems (IBCS-FMS), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1, D-76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany.', 'Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Minia University, 61519-El-Minia, Egypt.', 'Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Minia University, 61519-El-Minia, Egypt.', 'Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Minia University, 61519-El-Minia, Egypt.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, 76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Helsinki, P.O.

Multiple HTLV-1-encoded regulatory proteins, including Tax and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ), play key roles in viral persistence and latency. The HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein interacts with a plethora of host cellular proteins to regulate viral gene expression and also promote the aberrant activation of signaling pathways such as NF-kappaB to drive clonal proliferation and survival of T cells bearing the HTLV-1 provirus. Tax undergoes various post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination that regulate its function and subcellular localization. Tax shuttles in different subcellular compartments for the activation of anti-apoptotic genes and deregulates the cell cycle with the induction of DNA damage for the accumulation of genomic instability that can result in cellular immortalization and malignant transformation. However, Tax is highly immunogenic and therefore HTLV-1 has evolved numerous strategies to tightly regulate Tax expression while maintaining the pool of anti-apoptotic genes through HBZ. In this review, we summarize the key findings on the oncogenic mechanisms used by Tax that set the stage for the development of ATLL, and the strategies used by HTLV-1 to tightly regulate Tax expression for immune evasion and viral persistence.","['Mohanty, Suchitra', 'Harhaj, Edward W']","['Mohanty S', 'Harhaj EW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Pathogens,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",101596317,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATLL', 'HTLV-1', 'NF-kappaB', 'Tax', 'apoptosis']",2020/07/11 06:00,2020/07/11 06:01,['2020/07/11 06:00'],"['2020/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/11 06:01 [medline]']","['pathogens9070543 [pii]', '10.3390/pathogens9070543 [doi]']",epublish,Pathogens. 2020 Jul 7;9(7). pii: pathogens9070543. doi: 10.3390/pathogens9070543.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1197-6765'],20200707,,,['RO1CA135362/NH/NIH HHS/United States'],PMC7399876,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal cell cycle progression has been reported participating in tumorigenesis. Our previous study found that lncRNA-OBFC2A was involved in benzene toxicity through regulating cell proliferation. However, the function of lncRNA-OBFC2A in the regulation of cell cycle remains obscure and the precise mechanisms need to be explored. In vitro study, results showed that benzene metabolic, 1,4-Benzoquinone (1,4-BQ), induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase accompanied with decreased expression of Cyclin D1 in a dose-dependently manner. Interestingly, lncRNA-OBFC2A overexpression was found in AHH-1 cells treated with 1,4-BQ and while interference with lncRNA-OBFC2A, the expression of Cyclin D1 were reversed. Further, we found that lncRNA-OBFC2A can interact with Smad3 to control cell cycle via modulating Cyclin D1 expression. In benzene exposed workers, the expression of lncRNA-OBFC2A and Smad3 increased while cyclin D1 decreased which was consistent with the in vitro experiment, meanwhile, the significant associations among them were also found. Thus, these findings indicate that lncRNA-OBFC2A targeted to Smad3 regulated cyclin D1 influences cell cycle arrest induced by 1,4-BQ. LncRNA-OBFC2A, Smad3 and Cyclin D1 as a set of biomarkers play important roles in benzene haematotoxicity.","['Guo, Xiaoli', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Ren, Jing', 'Chen, Yujiao', 'Wang, Jingyu', 'Zhu, Chendi', 'Zhang, Yanlin', 'Gao, Ai']","['Guo X', 'Zhang W', 'Ren J', 'Chen Y', 'Wang J', 'Zhu C', 'Zhang Y', 'Gao A']","['Department of Occupational Health and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, PR China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, PR China.', 'Department of Occupational Health and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, PR China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, PR China.', 'Department of Occupational Health and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, PR China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, PR China.', 'Department of Occupational Health and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, PR China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, PR China.', 'Department of Occupational Health and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, PR China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, PR China.', 'Department of Occupational Health and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, PR China.', 'Research Center of Occupational Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, PR China.

As a result, over the last two decades substantial efforts have been directed towards identification and development of pharmaceutical CDK inhibitors. Insights into the biological consequences of CDK inhibition in specific tumor types have led to the successful development of CDK4/6 inhibitors as treatments for certain types of breast cancer. More recently, a new generation of pharmaceutical inhibitors of CDK enzymes that regulate the transcription of key oncogenic and pro-survival proteins, including CDK9, have entered clinical development. Here, we provide the first disclosure of the chemical structure of fadraciclib (CYC065), a CDK inhibitor and clinical candidate designed by further optimization from the aminopurine scaffold of seliciclib. We describe its synthesis and mechanistic characterization. Fadraciclib exhibits improved potency and selectivity for CDK2 and CDK9 compared to seliciclib, and also displays high selectivity across the kinome. We show that the mechanism of action of fadraciclib is consistent with potent inhibition of CDK9-mediated transcription, decreasing levels of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain serine 2 phosphorylation, the pro-survival protein Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 (MCL1) and MYC oncoprotein, and inducing rapid apoptosis in cancer cells. This cellular potency and mechanism of action translate to promising anti-cancer activity in human leukemia mouse xenograft models. Studies of leukemia cell line sensitivity identify mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene status and the level of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family proteins as potential markers for selection of patients with greater sensitivity to fadraciclib. We show that the combination of fadraciclib with BCL2 inhibitors, including venetoclax, is synergistic in leukemic cell models, as predicted from simultaneous inhibition of MCL1 and BCL2 pro-survival pathways. Fadraciclib preclinical pharmacology data support its therapeutic potential in CDK9- or CDK2-dependent cancers and as a rational combination with BCL2 inhibitors in hematological malignancies. Fadraciclib is currently in Phase 1 clinical studies in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT02552953) and also in combination with venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (NCT03739554) and relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (NCT04017546).","['Frame, Sheelagh', 'Saladino, Chiara', 'MacKay, Craig', 'Atrash, Butrus', 'Sheldrake, Peter', 'McDonald, Edward', 'Clarke, Paul A', 'Workman, Paul', 'Blake, David', 'Zheleva, Daniella']","['Frame S', 'Saladino C', 'MacKay C', 'Atrash B', 'Sheldrake P', 'McDonald E', 'Clarke PA', 'Workman P', 'Blake D', 'Zheleva D']","['Cyclacel Limited, Dundee, United Kingdom.', 'Cyclacel Limited, Dundee, United Kingdom.', 'Cyclacel Limited, Dundee, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, Division of Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, Division of Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, Division of Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, Division of Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Cancer Therapeutics Unit, Division of Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Cyclacel Limited, Dundee, United Kingdom.', 'Cyclacel Limited, Dundee, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (CYC065)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",,,2020/07/10 06:00,2020/09/15 06:00,['2020/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0234103 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-15636 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Jul 9;15(7):e0234103. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0234103. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9342-1290', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1773-3687']",20200709,,,"['C309/A11566 /CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C2739/A22897/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",PMC7347136,['PLoS One. 2021 May 6;16(5):e0251671.

Fifty newly diagnosed pediatric Philadelphia negative B-ALL patients were included in this study. Using Bone Marrow samples, RAG1 expression was assessed by real time PCR and IKZF1 deletions were determined by multiplex real-time quantitative PCR. The expression of RAG1 was significantly higher in B-ALL patients as compared to the controls (p < .001). The B-ALL patients with RAG1 high expression (>/=median) had lower response to induction of remission, shorter DFS, shorter overall survival, higher blast cells, and white cell counts in the peripheral blood as compared to those with low RAG1 expression levels (p < .01 for all). Likewise, there was significant association between IKZF1 deletion and high RAG1 expression. Based on our findings RAG1 high expression and IKZF1 deletions were associated with adverse prognosis in Philadelphia negative B-ALL.

32644754,,Publisher,,,,,,2022 Jan,Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,,,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a neoplasm of the lymphoid tissues originating from B cell precursors, mature B cells, T cell precursors, and mature T cells. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma comprises various subtypes, each with different epidemiologies, etiologies, immunophenotypic, genetic, clinical features, and response to therapy. It can be divided into two groups, 'indolent' and 'aggressive,' based on the disease's prognosis. The most common mature B cell neoplasms are Follicular lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, Mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, primary CNS lymphoma. The most common mature T cell lymphomas are Adult T cell lymphoma, Mycosis fungoides.[1] The treatment of NHL varies greatly, depending on tumor stage, grade, and type of lymphoma, and various patient factors (e.g., symptoms, age, performance status). The natural history of these tumors shows significant variation. Indolent lymphomas present with waxing and waning lymphadenopathy for many years, whereas aggressive lymphomas have specific B symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, fever and can result in deaths within a few weeks if untreated. Lymphomas that usually have indolent presentations include follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone lymphoma. Aggressive lymphomas include diffuse large B cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, precursor B and T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, and adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma, and certain other peripheral T cell lymphomas. Up to two-thirds of patients present with peripheral lymphadenopathy. Rashes on the skin, increased hypersensitivity reactions to insect bites, generalized fatigue, pruritus, malaise, fever of unknown origin, ascites, and effusions are less common presenting features. Approximately half of the patients develop the extranodal disease (secondary extranodal disease) during the course of their disease, while between 10 and 35 percent of patients have primary extranodal lymphoma at diagnosis. Primary gastrointestinal (GI) tract lymphoma may present with nausea and vomiting, aversion to food, weight loss, fullness of abdomen, early satiety, visceral obstruction related symptoms. Patients may even present with features of acute perforation and gastrointestinal bleeding, and at times with features of malabsorption syndrome. Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma may present with headaches, spinal cord compression features, lethargy, focal neurologic deficits, seizures, and paralysis.","['Sapkota, Sumina', 'Shaikh, Hira']","['Sapkota S', 'Shaikh H']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,,,2020/07/10 06:01,2020/07/10 06:01,,,['NBK559328 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20200710,['20211205'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2020/07/10 06:01']

Of them, approximately 1-5% eventually develop symptomatic ATL.[1] HTLV-1 is the first human retrovirus and is endemic in the north and south parts of Japan, the Caribbean region, Africa, some parts in the Middle East, South, and Central America.[2] HTLV-1 transmission occurs from mother to child through breastfeeding, sexual interaction, and blood transfusion. Initial presentation may vary, including generalized lymph node swelling, hepatosplenomegaly, skin involvement, and opportunistic infections. ATL is classified into four clinical subtypes: acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering type. Aggressive ATL (acute, lymphoma, and chronic type with unfavorable prognostic factors) have a poor prognosis with an overall survival rate of less than a year. The favorable chronic and smoldering subtypes carry a relatively good prognosis, and watchful waiting is generally preferred until disease progression occurs. Patients who have rapidly progressive disease carry a poor prognosis due to the chemo-resistance of malignant cells and severe immunosuppression.[3]","['Durer, Ceren', 'Babiker, Hani M.']","['Durer C', 'Babiker HM']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,,,2020/07/10 06:01,2020/07/10 06:01,,,['NBK558968 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20200710,['20210630'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2020/07/10 06:01']

We examined whether caffeic and chlorogenic acid (1-250 microM) exert antitumor action in human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) and human acute T-cell leukemia cells (Jurkat). Caffeic and chlorogenic acid did not reduce cell viability in the two cell lines, as assessed using the neutral red uptake and MTT assays. These phenolic acids (1-100 muM) neither induced DNA damage (comet assay) nor increased the micronuclei frequency (micronucleus assay) in HL-60 and Jurkat cells, indicating that they were not genotoxic or mutagenic. Analysis of global DNA methylation levels using a 5-mC DNA ELISA kit revealed that chlorogenic acid at a non-cytotoxic concentration (100 muM) induced global DNA hypomethylation in Jurkat cells, but not in HL-60 cells, suggesting that it exerts a cell-specific effect. Caffeic acid did not change global DNA methylation. As other phenolic compounds, chlorogenic acid probably modulates DNA methylation by targeting DNA methyltransferases. The hypomethylating action of chlorogenic acid can be beneficial against hematological malignances whose pathogenic processes involve impairment of DNA methylation.","['Hernandes, Livia Cristina', 'Machado, Ana Rita Thomazela', 'Tuttis, Katiuska', 'Ribeiro, Diego Luis', 'Aissa, Alexandre Ferro', 'Devoz, Paula Picoli', 'Antunes, Lusania Maria Greggi']","['Hernandes LC', 'Machado ART', 'Tuttis K', 'Ribeiro DL', 'Aissa AF', 'Devoz PP', 'Antunes LMG']","['Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade de Sao Paulo USP, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade de Sao Paulo USP, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade de Sao Paulo - USP, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas de Ribeirao Preto Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Brazil,Genet Mol Biol,Genetics and molecular biology,100883590,,,,,,2020/07/10 06:00,2020/07/10 06:01,['2020/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/10 06:01 [medline]']","['S1415-47572020000500502 [pii]', '10.1590/1678-4685-GMB-2019-0347 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Biol. 2020 Jul 3;43(3):e20190347. doi: 10.1590/1678-4685-GMB-2019-0347.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3079-4388'],20200703,,,,PMC7350414,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It presents as de novo or may arise from multiple myeloma (MM), and hence is diagnosed as primary or secondary PCL, respectively. We report a case of 79-year-old patient diagnosed with MM two years prior to the admission to our institution with prior treatment with bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRD) and daratumumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone. Morphologic examination and flow cytometry studies performed on the peripheral smear demonstrated 45%-55% small to medium atypical plasma cells showing a kappa restriction and dim CD138 expression on flow cytometry analysis. The patient was started on brentuximab vedotin, etoposide, cytoxan and dexamethasone, which resulted in near complete elimination of the atypical plasma cells from the peripheral smear one week after the completion of two cycles. He received three cycles of brentuximab vedotin with a gradual decrease in serum free light chain. However, he eventually developed lethargy, weakness and seizures.

Although he had neither blast cells in the peripheral blood nor leucocytosis, urgent bronchoscopy findings demonstrated blast cells invading both the alveolar spaces/alveolar septa and the vein walls. These pathological findings corresponded to ground-glass opacities and thickening of the interlobular septa on thoracic computed tomography (CT).

Even so, some ALL survivors fail to mount or to maintain protective Abs. Germinal centres (GCs) are clusters of proliferating B cells in follicles of secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs) formed during adaptive immune responses and the origins of long-lived memory B and plasma cells that are the source of Abs. Furthermore, productive GC reactions depend on T follicular helper (TFH) cells. To understand why chemotherapy induces deficits in Ab responses, we examined how SLTs were affected by chemotherapy. Methods: Rhesus macaques were infused with either three cycles of the anthracycline doxorubicin or saline, followed by immunisation with a de novo and booster antigen. Spleen and lymph nodes were removed, and memory B, bulk T and TFH cells were examined. Results: Despite adequate GC morphology, a diminished memory and IgG(+) B-cell population along with diminished total and booster vaccine-specific IgG-producing memory B cells were noted in the spleens of macaques with past doxorubicin exposure compared to the saline-treated controls (P < 0.05). Intact bulk T and TFH cells were found in the SLTs of treated macaques, which displayed higher CD40L upregulation capacity by their splenic CXCR5(+) helper T cells (P < 0.01). In contrast to the spleen, the immune cell populations studied were comparable between the lymph nodes of both saline- and doxorubicin-treated macaques. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the splenic memory B-cell subset, compared to its lymph node counterpart, is more severely altered by anthracycline treatment.","['Lasaviciute, Gintare', 'Bricaud, Andreas L', 'Hellgren, Fredrika', 'Ingelman-Sundberg, Hanna M', 'Eksborg, Staffan', 'Jonker, Margreet', 'Haanstra, Krista G', 'Hed Myrberg, Ida', 'Sverremark-Ekstrom, Eva', 'Lore, Karin', 'Saghafian-Hedengren, Shanie', 'Nilsson, Anna']","['Lasaviciute G', 'Bricaud AL', 'Hellgren F', 'Ingelman-Sundberg HM', 'Eksborg S', 'Jonker M', 'Haanstra KG', 'Hed Myrberg I', 'Sverremark-Ekstrom E', 'Lore K', 'Saghafian-Hedengren S', 'Nilsson A']","['Departmet of Molecular Biosciences The Wenner-Gren Institute Stockholm University Stockholm Sweden.', ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit Department of Women's and Children's Health Karolinska Institutet Stockholm Sweden."", 'Department of Medicine Solna Division of Immunology and Allergy Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital Stockholm Sweden.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Karolinska Institutet Stockholm Sweden.', ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit Department of Women's and Children's Health Karolinska Institutet Stockholm Sweden."", ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit Department of Women's and Children's Health Karolinska Institutet Stockholm Sweden."", 'Biomedical Primate Research Centre (BPRC) Rijswijk The Netherlands.', 'Biomedical Primate Research Centre (BPRC) Rijswijk The Netherlands.', ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit Department of Women's and Children's Health Karolinska Institutet Stockholm Sweden."", 'Departmet of Molecular Biosciences The Wenner-Gren Institute Stockholm University Stockholm Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine Solna Division of Immunology and Allergy Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital Stockholm Sweden.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Karolinska Institutet Stockholm Sweden.', 'Departmet of Molecular Biosciences The Wenner-Gren Institute Stockholm University Stockholm Sweden.', ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit Department of Women's and Children's Health Karolinska Institutet Stockholm Sweden."", ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit Department of Women's and Children's Health Karolinska Institutet Stockholm Sweden.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Clin Transl Immunology,Clinical & translational immunology,101638268,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['anthracycline', 'de novo and booster vaccine', 'memory B-cell response', 'rhesus macaque', 'secondary lymphoid organs']",2020/07/10 06:00,2020/07/10 06:01,['2020/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/cti2.1150 [doi]', 'CTI21150 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Transl Immunology. 2020 Jul 2;9(7):e1150. doi: 10.1002/cti2.1150. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1067-0342'],20200702,,"['(c) 2020 The Authors.

Recently several studies demonstrated that palladium complexes showed remarkable cytotoxic effects against K562 cell line and could be used efficiently for treatment of many human cancers including leukemia. Hereof, K562 cells were made resistant to cisplatin using increasing concentration of cisplatin up to 4.5 mM and then cytotoxic effect of synthesized palladium complex was evaluated on this sub-line using MTT assay. Annexin V/PI staining using flow cytometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to find out the mechanism of the observed cytotoxicity. Results indicated that tested compounds had a noticeable cytotoxic effect on K562 cells 80 times more than cisplatin. Palladium complex also showed significant cytotoxicity on resistant K562 sub-line. Flow cytometry and SEM results revealed that these compounds exert their cytotoxic effect via apoptosis and it could be concluded that the novel synthesized palladium complex might be a good candidate for replacing cisplatin in case of treatment of cisplatin resistant tumors.","['Jahanian-Najafabadi, Ali', 'Mirian, Mina', 'Rohani, Fatemeh', 'Karami, Kazem', 'Hosseini Kharat, Mahboubeh', 'Sadeghi-Aliabadi, Hojjat']","['Jahanian-Najafabadi A', 'Mirian M', 'Rohani F', 'Karami K', 'Hosseini Kharat M', 'Sadeghi-Aliabadi H']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran J Pharm Res,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,101208407,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis assay', 'Cisplatin resistance', 'K562 cells', 'MTT assay', 'Palladacyclic complex']",2020/07/10 06:00,2020/07/10 06:01,['2020/07/10 06:00'],"['2020/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22037/ijpr.2019.1100714 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran J Pharm Res. 2019 Summer;18(3):1323-1331. doi: 10.22037/ijpr.2019.1100714.,,,,,,PMC6934943,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in KMT2A were first reported in Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WDSTS). More recently, KMT2A variants have been described in probands with a specific clinical diagnosis comprised in the so-called chromatinopathies. Such conditions, including WDSTS, are a group of overlapping disorders caused by mutations in genes coding for the epigenetic machinery. Among them, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is mainly caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in CREBBP or EP300. In this work, we used next generation sequencing (either by custom-made panel or by whole exome) to identify alternative causative genes in individuals with a RSTS-like phenotype negative to CREBBP and EP300 mutational screening. In six patients we identified different novel unreported variants in KMT2A gene. The identified variants are de novo in at least four out of six tested individuals and all of them display some typical RSTS phenotypic features but also WDSTS specific signs. This study reinforces the concept that germline variants affecting the epigenetic machinery lead to a shared molecular effect (alteration of the chromatin state) determining superimposable clinical conditions.","['Di Fede, Elisabetta', 'Massa, Valentina', 'Augello, Bartolomeo', 'Squeo, Gabriella', 'Scarano, Emanuela', 'Perri, Anna Maria', 'Fischetto, Rita', 'Causio, Francesco Andrea', 'Zampino, Giuseppe', 'Piccione, Maria', 'Curridori, Elena', 'Mazza, Tommaso', 'Castellana, Stefano', 'Larizza, Lidia', 'Ghelma, Filippo', 'Colombo, Elisa Adele', 'Gandini, Maria Chiara', 'Castori, Marco', 'Merla, Giuseppe', 'Milani, Donatella', 'Gervasini, Cristina']","['Di Fede E', 'Massa V', 'Augello B', 'Squeo G', 'Scarano E', 'Perri AM', 'Fischetto R', 'Causio FA', 'Zampino G', 'Piccione M', 'Curridori E', 'Mazza T', 'Castellana S', 'Larizza L', 'Ghelma F', 'Colombo EA', 'Gandini MC', 'Castori M', 'Merla G', 'Milani D', 'Gervasini C']","['Genetica Medica e Biologia Applicata, Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'Genetica Medica e Biologia Applicata, Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy.', '""Aldo Ravelli"" Center for Neurotechnology and Experimental Brain Therapeutics, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'Unita di Genetica Medica, IRCSS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Unita di Genetica Medica, IRCSS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Ambulatorio di Malattie Rare, Sindromologia ed Auxologia U.O.

In pediatrics, it predominantly occurs in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) and especially in patients with trisomy 21, called myeloid leukemia in Down syndrome (ML-DS). Defects in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and cytokines specifically released by the myeloid blasts are thought to be the main drivers of fibrosis in the bone marrow niche (BMN). To model the BMN of pediatric patients with AMKL in mice, we first established MSCs from pediatric patients with AMKL (n = 5) and ML-DS (n = 9). Healthy donor control MSCs (n = 6) were generated from unaffected children and adolescents </=18 years of age. Steady-state analyses of the MSCs revealed that patient-derived MSCs exhibited decreased adipogenic differentiation potential and enrichment of proliferation-associated genes. Importantly, TGFB1 exposure in vitro promoted early profibrotic changes in all three MSC entities. To study BMF induction for longer periods of time, we created an in vivo humanized artificial BMN subcutaneously in immunodeficient NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid) Il2rg(tm1Wjl)/SzJ mice, using a mixture of MSCs, human umbilical vein endothelial cell, and Matrigel. Injection of AMKL blasts as producers of TGFB1 into this BMN after 8 weeks induced fibrosis grade I/II in a dose-dependent fashion over a time period of 4 weeks. Thus, our study developed a humanized mouse model that will be instrumental to specifically examine leukemogenesis and therapeutic targets for AMKL blasts in future. IMPLICATIONS: TGFB1 supports fibrosis induction in a pediatric AMKL model generated with patient-derived MSCs.

Complex retroviruses like human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encode the viral infectivity factor (Vif) protein to counteract APOBEC3 proteins. Vif induces degradation of APOBEC3G and other APOBEC3 proteins and thereby prevents their packaging into virions. It is not known if murine leukemia virus (MLV) encodes a Vif-like protein. Here, we show that the MLV P50 protein, produced from an alternatively spliced gag RNA, interacts with the C terminus of mouse APOBEC3 and prevents its packaging without causing its degradation. By infecting APOBEC3 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice with Friend or Moloney MLV P50-deficient viruses, we found that APOBEC3 restricts the mutant viruses more than WT viruses in vivo Replication of P50-mutant viruses in an APOBEC3-expressing stable cell line was also much slower than that of WT viruses, and overexpressing P50 in this cell line enhanced mutant virus replication. Thus, MLV encodes a protein, P50, that overcomes APOBEC3 restriction by preventing its packaging into virions.IMPORTANCE MLV has existed in mice for at least a million years, in spite of the existence of host restriction factors that block infection. Although MLV is considered a simple retrovirus compared to lentiviruses, it does encode proteins generated from alternatively spliced RNAs. Here, we show that P50, generated from an alternatively spliced RNA encoded in gag, counteracts APOBEC3 by blocking its packaging. MLV also encodes a protein, glycoGag, that increases capsid stability and limits APOBEC3 access to the reverse transcription complex (RTC). Thus, MLV has evolved multiple means of preventing APOBEC3 from blocking infection, explaining its survival as an infectious pathogen in mice.","['Zhao, Wenming', 'Akkawi, Charbel', 'Mougel, Marylene', 'Ross, Susan R']","['Zhao W', 'Akkawi C', 'Mougel M', 'Ross SR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Illinois Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'IRIM, CNRS, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'IRIM, CNRS, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Illinois Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA srross@uic.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Capsid/metabolism', 'Cytidine Deaminase/deficiency/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Virion/genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Virus Replication']",['NOTNLM'],"['*APOBEC3', '*accessory protein', '*restriction factor', '*retrovirus']",2020/07/10 06:00,2020/11/25 06:00,['2020/07/10 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00032-20 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00032-20 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2020 Aug 31;94(18). pii: JVI.00032-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00032-20.

PML is the structural backbone of NBs, comprising different isoforms. However, the contribution of each isoform to alphaherpesvirus restriction is not well understood. Here, we report the role of PML-NBs and swine PML (sPML) isoforms in pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection in its natural host swine cells. We found that sPML-NBs exhibit an anti-PRV activity in the context of increasing the expression level of endogenous sPML. Of four sPML isoforms cloned and examined, only isoforms sPML-II and -IIa, not sPML-I and -IVa, expressed in a sPML knockout cells inhibit PRV infection. Both the unique 7b region of sPML-II and the sumoylation-dependent normal formation of PML-NBs are required. 7b possesses a transcriptional repression activity and suppresses viral gene transcription during PRV infection with the cysteine residues 589 and 599 being critically involved. We conclude that sPML-NBs inhibit PRV infection partly by repressing viral gene transcription through the 7b region of sPML-II.IMPORTANCE PML-NBs are nuclear sites that mediate the antiviral restriction of alphaherpesvirus gene expression and replication. However, the contribution of each PML isoform to this activity of PML-NBs is not well characterized. Using PRV and its natural host swine cells as a system, we have discovered that the unique C terminus of sPML isoform II is required for PML-NBs to inhibit PRV infection by directly engaging in repression of viral gene transcription. Our study not only confirms in swine cells that PML-NBs have an antiviral function but also presents a mechanism to suggest that PML-NBs inhibit viral infection in an isoform specific manner.","['Yu, Cuilian', 'Xu, Aotian', 'Lang, Yue', 'Qin, Chao', 'Wang, Mengdong', 'Yuan, Xiufang', 'Sun, Shengfu', 'Feng, Wenhai', 'Gao, Chao', 'Chen, Jinwen', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Tang, Jun']","['Yu C', 'Xu A', 'Lang Y', 'Qin C', 'Wang M', 'Yuan X', 'Sun S', 'Feng W', 'Gao C', 'Chen J', 'Zhang R', 'Tang J']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, China.', 'Shandong Provincial Center for Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Jinan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China zhangrui_2046@163.com jtang@cau.edu.cn.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China zhangrui_2046@163.com jtang@cau.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Herpesvirus 1, Suid/*genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Macrophages/metabolism/virology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sumoylation', 'Swine', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*PML-NBs', '*alphaherpesviruses', '*pseudorabies virus', '*swine PML isoform II', '*transcription repressor']",2020/07/10 06:00,2020/11/25 06:00,['2020/07/10 06:00'],"['2020/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01197-20 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01197-20 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2020 Aug 31;94(18). pii: JVI.01197-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01197-20.

To identify sequential molecular alterations that occur during the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we compared 52 early and 108 overt HCC samples by genome sequencing. Gene mutations in the p53/RB1 pathway, WNT pathway, MLL protein family, SWI/SNF complexes, and AKT/PI3K pathway were common in HCC. In the early phase of all entities, TERT was the most frequently upregulated gene owing to diverse mechanisms. Despite frequent somatic mutations in driver genes, including CTNNB1 and TP53, early HCC was a separate molecular entity from overt HCC, as each had a distinct expression profile. Notably, WNT target genes were not activated in early HCC regardless of CTNNB1 mutation status because beta-catenin did not translocate into the nucleus due to the E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex at the membrane. Conversely, WNT targets were definitively upregulated in overt HCC, with CTNNB1 mutation associated with downregulation of CDH1 and hypomethylation of CpG islands in target genes. Similarly, cell-cycle genes downstream of the p53/RB pathway were upregulated only in overt HCC, with TP53 or RB1 gene mutations associated with chromosomal deletion of 4q or 16q. HCC was epigenetically distinguished into four subclasses: normal-like methylation, global-hypomethylation (favorable prognosis), stem-like methylation (poor prognosis), and CpG island methylation. These methylation statuses were globally maintained through HCC progression. Collectively, these data show that as HCC progresses, additional molecular events exclusive of driver gene mutations cooperatively contribute to transcriptional activation of downstream targets according to methylation status. SIGNIFICANCE: In addition to driver gene mutations in the WNT and p53 pathways, further molecular events are required for aberrant transcriptional activation of these pathways as HCC progresses.","['Midorikawa, Yutaka', 'Yamamoto, Shogo', 'Tatsuno, Kenji', 'Renard-Guillet, Claire', 'Tsuji, Shingo', 'Hayashi, Akimasa', 'Ueda, Hiroki', 'Fukuda, Shiro', 'Fujita, Takanori', 'Katoh, Hiroto', 'Ishikawa, Shumpei', 'Covington, Kyle R', 'Creighton, Chad J', 'Sugitani, Masahiko', 'Wheeler, David A', 'Shibata, Tatsuhiro', 'Nagae, Genta', 'Takayama, Tadatoshi', 'Aburatani, Hiroyuki']","['Midorikawa Y', 'Yamamoto S', 'Tatsuno K', 'Renard-Guillet C', 'Tsuji S', 'Hayashi A', 'Ueda H', 'Fukuda S', 'Fujita T', 'Katoh H', 'Ishikawa S', 'Covington KR', 'Creighton CJ', 'Sugitani M', 'Wheeler DA', 'Shibata T', 'Nagae G', 'Takayama T', 'Aburatani H']","['Genome Science Division, RCAST, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. mido-tky@umin.ac.jp haburata-tky@umin.ac.jp.', 'Department of Digestive Surgery, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Genome Science Division, RCAST, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Genome Science Division, RCAST, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Genome Science Division, RCAST, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Genome Science Division, RCAST, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Genome Science Division, RCAST, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Genome Science Division, RCAST, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Genome Science Division, RCAST, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Genome Science Division, RCAST, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Baylor College of Medicine's Human Genome Sequencing Center, Houston, Texas."", ""Baylor College of Medicine's Human Genome Sequencing Center, Houston, Texas."", 'Department of Pathology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Baylor College of Medicine's Human Genome Sequencing Center, Houston, Texas."", 'Division of Cancer Genomics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Genome Science Division, RCAST, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Digestive Surgery, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Genome Science Division, RCAST, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. mido-tky@umin.ac.jp haburata-tky@umin.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*genetics/pathology', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Drive Technology', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, cdc', '*Genes, p53', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics', 'Probability', 'RNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Telomerase/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Up-Regulation', 'Wnt Proteins/*genetics', 'beta Catenin/genetics']",,,2020/07/10 06:00,2021/01/15 06:00,['2020/07/10 06:00'],"['2020/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-20-0225 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-0225 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2020 Sep 15;80(18):3810-3819. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-0225.

Here, we show that the ectonucleotidase CD39 (ENTPD1) is upregulated in cytarabine-resistant leukemic cells from both AML cell lines and patient samples in vivo and in vitro. CD39 cell-surface expression and activity is increased in patients with AML upon chemotherapy compared with diagnosis, and enrichment in CD39-expressing blasts is a marker of adverse prognosis in the clinics. High CD39 activity promotes cytarabine resistance by enhancing mitochondrial activity and biogenesis through activation of a cAMP-mediated adaptive mitochondrial stress response. Finally, genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of CD39 ecto-ATPase activity blocks the mitochondrial reprogramming triggered by cytarabine treatment and markedly enhances its cytotoxicity in AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results reveal CD39 as a new residual disease marker and a promising therapeutic target to improve chemotherapy response in AML. SIGNIFICANCE: Extracellular ATP and CD39-P2RY13-cAMP-OxPHOS axis are key regulators of cytarabine resistance, offering a new promising therapeutic strategy in AML.This article is highlighted in the In

In this study, we determined the effect of DTC and TPA in combination on HL-60 cells cultured in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we have shown that DTC and TPA synergistically inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells and strongly induced apoptosis in the cells. Mechanistic studies showed that the combined effects of DTC and TPA were associated with a decrease in Bcl-2. The animal experiment showed that the combination of DTC and TPA more potently inhibited the growth of HL-60 tumors than either agent alone.

However, aberrant and chronic inflammasome activation underlies the pathology of numerous common inflammatory diseases. Inflammasome assembly causes activation of the protease caspase-1 which in turn activates proinflammatory cytokines and induces a lytic type of cell death termed pyroptosis. Although NLRP1 (NACHT, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 1) was the first inflammasome sensor, described almost 20 years ago, the molecular mechanisms underlying its activation and the resulting downstream events are incompletely understood. This is partially a consequence of the poor conservation of the NLRP1 pathway between human and mice. Moreover, recent evidence demonstrates a complex and multi-stage mechanism of NLRP1 inflammasome activation. In contrast to other inflammasome sensors, NLRP1 possesses protease activity required for proteolytic self-cleavage and activation mediated by the function-to-find domain (FIIND). CARD8 is a second FIIND protein and is expressed in humans but not in mice. In immune cells and AML (acute myeloid leukemia) cells, the anti-cancer drug talabostat induces CARD8 activation and causes caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis. In contrast, in human keratinocytes talabostat induces NLRP1 activation and massive proinflammatory cytokine activation. NLRP1 is regarded as the principal inflammasome sensor in human keratinocytes and UVB radiation induces its activation, which is believed to underlie the induction of sunburn. Moreover, gain-of-function mutations of NLRP1 cause inflammatory skin syndromes and a predisposition for the development of skin cancer. SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) of NLRP1 are associated with several (auto)inflammatory diseases with a major skin phenotype, such as psoriasis or vitiligo.

Here, we show that high-throughput population-level time-lapse imaging can be used to quantify fractional killing in response to hundreds of different drug treatments in parallel. We find that stable intermediate levels of fractional killing are uncommon, with many drug treatments resulting in complete or near-complete eradication of all cells, if given enough time. The kinetics of fractional killing over time vary substantially as a function of drug, drug dose, and genetic background. At the molecular level, the antiapoptotic protein MCL1 is an important determinant of the kinetics of fractional killing in response to MAPK pathway inhibitors but not other lethal stimuli. These studies suggest that fractional killing is governed by diverse lethal stimulus-specific mechanisms.","['Inde, Zintis', 'Forcina, Giovanni C', 'Denton, Kyle', 'Dixon, Scott J']","['Inde Z', 'Forcina GC', 'Denton K', 'Dixon SJ']","['Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.

Cell signalling downstream of the BCR is aberrantly activated in the B cell malignancy chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), supporting the pathophysiology of the disease. This insight has led to development and approval of small molecule inhibitors that target components of the BCR pathway. These advances have greatly improved the management of CLL, but the disease remains incurable. This may partly be explained by the inter-patient heterogeneity of the disease, also when it comes to treatment responses. Precision medicine is therefore required to optimize treatment and move towards a cure. Here, we discuss how the introduction of BCR signalling inhibitors has facilitated the development of functional in vitro assays to guide clinical treatment decisions on use of the same therapeutic agents in individual patients. The cellular responses to these agents can be analysed in high-throughput assays such as dynamic BH3 profiling, phospho flow experiments and drug sensitivity screens to identify predictive biomarkers. This progress exemplifies the positive synergy between basal and translational research needed to optimize patient care.","['Skanland, Sigrid S', 'Karlsen, Linda', 'Tasken, Kjetil']","['Skanland SS', 'Karlsen L', 'Tasken K']","['Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'K.

One of the most striking examples of epistasis occurs for mutations in RNA splicing factors. These lesions are among the most common alterations in myeloid neoplasms and generally occur in a mutually exclusive manner, a finding attributed to their synthetic lethal interactions and/or convergent effects. Curiously, however, patients with multiple-concomitant splicing factor mutations have been observed, challenging our understanding of one of the most common examples of epistasis in hematologic malignancies. In this study, we performed bulk and single-cell analyses of patients with myeloid malignancy who were harboring >/=2 splicing factor mutations, to understand the frequency and basis for the coexistence of these mutations. Although mutations in splicing factors were strongly mutually exclusive across 4231 patients (q < .001), 0.85% harbored 2 concomitant bona fide splicing factor mutations, approximately 50% of which were present in the same individual cells. However, the distribution of mutations in patients with double mutations deviated from that in those with single mutations, with selection against the most common alleles, SF3B1K700E and SRSF2P95H/L/R, and selection for less common alleles, such as SF3B1 non-K700E mutations, rare amino acid substitutions at SRSF2P95, and combined U2AF1S34/Q157 mutations. SF3B1 and SRSF2 alleles enriched in those with double-mutations had reduced effects on RNA splicing and/or binding compared with the most common alleles. Moreover, dual U2AF1 mutations occurred in cis with preservation of the wild-type allele. These data highlight allele-specific differences as critical in regulating the molecular effects of splicing factor mutations as well as their cooccurrences/exclusivities with one another.","['Taylor, Justin', 'Mi, Xiaoli', 'North, Khrystyna', 'Binder, Moritz', 'Penson, Alexander', 'Lasho, Terra', 'Knorr, Katherine', 'Haddadin, Michael', 'Liu, Bo', 'Pangallo, Joseph', 'Benbarche, Salima', 'Wiseman, Daniel', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Halene, Stephanie', 'Liang, Yang', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M', 'Bradley, Robert K', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar']","['Taylor J', 'Mi X', 'North K', 'Binder M', 'Penson A', 'Lasho T', 'Knorr K', 'Haddadin M', 'Liu B', 'Pangallo J', 'Benbarche S', 'Wiseman D', 'Tefferi A', 'Halene S', 'Liang Y', 'Patnaik MM', 'Bradley RK', 'Abdel-Wahab O']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Division of Public Health Sciences and.', 'Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Rochester, MN.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Rochester, MN.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Division of Public Health Sciences and.', 'Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Rochester, MN.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine and.', 'Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT; and.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Department of Hematologic Oncology, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Peoples Republic of China.', 'Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Public Health Sciences and.', 'Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (RNA Splicing Factors)'],IM,"['Alleles', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Epistasis, Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', '*Mutation', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA Splicing Factors/*genetics', 'Single-Cell Analysis']",,,2020/07/09 06:00,2021/03/23 06:00,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2020/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61683-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2020006868 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Sep 24;136(13):1477-1486. doi: 10.1182/blood.2020006868.,,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['K08 CA230319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK102792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL128239/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA251138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA242020/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK103854/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC7515689,,['Blood. 2020 Sep 24;136(13):1471-1472.

Automatized cell counters are an essential contemporary appliance for blast detection, but false-positive samples remain challenging in terms of time and resources. To reduce this issue, the White Precursor Channel (WPC) was introduced to Sysmex XN series; however, sensitivity may reduce when accommodating low specificity. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate WPC blast alarm flag performance with regard to detecting blast cells. METHODS: At two major Danish hospitals, random blood samples were collected from the routine setting in a four-week period and analyzed on WPC XN20 (Sysmex, Japan). Results were compared with manual differential white blood cell count (Manual WBCC) assisted by CellaVisionDM96. RESULTS: In 117 samples, we found 0.2 to 34.4% blasts, WPC blast flag specificity = 82% and a low sensitivity = 40%. However, other XN alarm flags forwarded samples to Manual WBCC, so blast cells were detected despite missing a specific blast flag: With all alarm flags, combined sensitivity increased to 88%. Overall, the WPC application stopped 18% of the 117 samples going to Manual WBCC (three false negatives). Q values are arbitrary probability measurements for the blast flag, and in five samples (0.5 to 47.3% blasts) imprecision ranged from 5.3 to 122 CV%. CONCLUSIONS: WPC blast alarm flags are imprecise and inaccurate, especially when blast counts are low. However, the XN20 will alarm samples with other flags so that most samples containing blast cells will be manually reviewed after all. Hence, the presented flag types should not bias the decisions of manual reviewers.","['Sejrup, Jesper', 'Pedersen, David M', 'Phillipsen, Jens P', 'Nielsen, Jesper O', 'Koch, Sheila P R', 'Smith, Julie']","['Sejrup J', 'Pedersen DM', 'Phillipsen JP', 'Nielsen JO', 'Koch SPR', 'Smith J']","['Department of Technology, Faculty of Health and Technology, University College Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Technology, Faculty of Health and Technology, University College Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Nordsjaellands Hospital (NOH), Hillerod, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet (RH), Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet (RH), Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Technology, Faculty of Health and Technology, University College Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['*Blast Crisis/blood/pathology', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/blood/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', '*Leukocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Male']",['NOTNLM'],"['Q values', 'Sysmex XN20', 'WDF', 'WPC', 'leukemia']",2020/07/09 06:00,2021/02/04 06:00,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2020/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13274 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2020 Dec;42(6):734-743. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13274.

In our study, we aimed to examine the contribution of Monocytosis Workflow Optimization rule set. METHODS: Adult patients with monocyte count >/=1.0 10(3) /microL and monocyte percentage >/=10% were included in our study. Blood smears were made from the samples in our laboratory. These smears were examined and patients were divided into two groups as reactive monocytosis or hematological malignancy. The groups were compared in terms of Monocytosis Workflow Optimization rule set and device flags. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients had hematological malignancies of 155 patients who were included in our study. Monocytosis Workflow Optimization rule set suggested performing blood smear in 19 of the patients with hematological malignancy, and evaluated two patients as reactive monocytosis with 90.5% sensitivity and 76.9% specificity. There was an ""abnormal lymphocyte/ blast"" flag in 90.5% of patients with hematological malignancies and in patients whose Monocytosis Workflow Optimization rule set defined as reactive monocytosis and it was found that sensitivity and negative predictive value reached 100%. CONCLUSION: Automated validation support systems and softwares developed especially for these systems make it possible to classify patients with their non-specific findings, as a result both contributing to the reduction of laboratory workload and costs and assisting laboratory specialists and clinicians with adding value to laboratory results.","['Kocaturk, Evin', 'Kusku Kiraz, Zeynep', 'Uskudar Teke, Hava', 'Demir, Sukru Saygin', 'Alatas, Ibrahim Ozkan']","['Kocaturk E', 'Kusku Kiraz Z', 'Uskudar Teke H', 'Demir SS', 'Alatas IO']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, Eskisehir Osmangazi University Medical Faculty, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Eskisehir Osmangazi University Medical Faculty, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University Medical Faculty, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Eskisehir Osmangazi University Medical Faculty, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Eskisehir Osmangazi University Medical Faculty, Eskisehir, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['Aged', 'Automation, Laboratory', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count/instrumentation/methods/standards', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['blood cell count', 'hematological malignancies', 'leukemia', 'mono-dysphasia-score', 'monocytosis']",2020/07/09 06:00,2021/02/04 06:00,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2020/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13281 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2020 Dec;42(6):744-749. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13281.

Here, we show that different mouse MRTFB splice isoforms, including a novel fourth MRTFB isoform named spliced neuronal long isoform of SRF transcriptional coactivator (SOLOIST)/MRTFB isoform 4 (MRTFB i4), play distinct roles in this process. SOLOIST/MRTFB i4 has a short exon that encodes 21 amino acid residues ahead of the first RPXXXEL (RPEL) motif in MRTFB isoform 3. Quantitative PCR revealed that SOLOIST/MRTFB i4 and isoform 1 were enriched in the forebrain and neurons, and up-regulated during brain development. Conversely, isoform 3 was detected in various tissues, including both neurons and astrocytes, and was down-regulated in the developing brain. Reporter assays supported the SRF-coactivator function of SOLOIST/MRTFB i4 as well as isoform 1. Acute expression of MRTFB isoform 1, but not isoform 3 or SOLOIST/MRTFB i4, in neuronal cells within 24 hr drastically increased endogenous immediate early gene [c-fos, egr1, and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein] expression, but not endogenous actinin alpha1, beta-actin, gelsolin, or srf gene expression measured by qPCR. Over-expression of SOLOIST/MRTFB i4 reduced the dendritic complexity of cortical neurons, whereas over-expression of isoform 1 increased this complexity. Co-expression of isoform 1 and SOLOIST/MRTFB i4 in cortical neurons revealed that isoform 1 competitively counteracted down-regulation by SOLOIST/MRTFB i4. Our findings indicate that MRTFB isoforms have unique expression patterns and differential effects on gene expression and dendritic complexity, which contribute to shaping neuronal circuits, at least in part.","['Ishibashi, Yuta', 'Shoji, Shizuku', 'Ihara, Daisuke', 'Kubo, Yukimi', 'Tanaka, Takuro', 'Tanabe, Hiroki', 'Hakamata, Tomoyuki', 'Miyata, Tomoaki', 'Satou, Natsumi', 'Sakagami, Hiroyuki', 'Mizuguchi, Mineyuki', 'Kikuchi, Keietsu', 'Fukuchi, Mamoru', 'Tsuda, Masaaki', 'Takasaki, Ichiro', 'Tabuchi, Akiko']","['Ishibashi Y', 'Shoji S', 'Ihara D', 'Kubo Y', 'Tanaka T', 'Tanabe H', 'Hakamata T', 'Miyata T', 'Satou N', 'Sakagami H', 'Mizuguchi M', 'Kikuchi K', 'Fukuchi M', 'Tsuda M', 'Takasaki I', 'Tabuchi A']","['Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Structural Biology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Present affiliation: Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience, Faculty of Pharmacy, Takasaki University of Health and Welfare, Takasaki, Gunma, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Graduate School of Innovative Life Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Graduate School of Medicine & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (myocardin-related transcription factor B, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/metabolism', 'Dendrites/ultrastructure', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Immediate-Early', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nerve Net/ultrastructure', 'Neurons/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*dendritic morphology', '*gene expression', '*isoform', '*myocardin-related transcription factor', '*serum response factor', '*transcriptional coactivator']",2020/07/09 06:00,2022/01/07 06:00,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2019/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jnc.15122 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 2021 Nov;159(4):762-777. doi: 10.1111/jnc.15122.

We have developed a nanoPOTS (nanodroplet processing in one pot for trace samples) platform and demonstrated its broad applicability for single-cell proteomics. However, because of nanoliter-scale sample volumes, the nanoPOTS platform is not compatible with automated LC-MS systems, which significantly limits sample throughput and robustness. To address this challenge, we have developed a nanoPOTS autosampler allowing fully automated sample injection from nanowells to LC-MS systems. We also developed a sample drying, extraction, and loading workflow to enable reproducible and reliable sample injection. The sequential analysis of 20 samples containing 10 ng tryptic peptides demonstrated high reproducibility with correlation coefficients of >0.995 between any two samples. The nanoPOTS autosampler can provide analysis throughput of 9.6, 16, and 24 single cells per day using 120, 60, and 30 min LC gradients, respectively. As a demonstration for single-cell proteomics, the autosampler was first applied to profiling protein expression in single MCF10A cells using a label-free approach. At a throughput of 24 single cells per day, an average of 256 proteins was identified from each cell and the number was increased to 731 when the Match Between Runs algorithm of MaxQuant was used. Using a multiplexed isobaric labeling approach (TMT-11plex), approximately 77 single cells could be analyzed per day. We analyzed 152 cells from three acute myeloid leukemia cell lines, resulting in a total of 2558 identified proteins with 1465 proteins quantifiable (70% valid values) across the 152 cells. These data showed quantitative single-cell proteomics can cluster cells to distinct groups and reveal functionally distinct differences.","['Williams, Sarah M', 'Liyu, Andrey V', 'Tsai, Chia-Feng', 'Moore, Ronald J', 'Orton, Daniel J', 'Chrisler, William B', 'Gaffrey, Matthew J', 'Liu, Tao', 'Smith, Richard D', 'Kelly, Ryan T', 'Pasa-Tolic, Ljiljana', 'Zhu, Ying']","['Williams SM', 'Liyu AV', 'Tsai CF', 'Moore RJ', 'Orton DJ', 'Chrisler WB', 'Gaffrey MJ', 'Liu T', 'Smith RD', 'Kelly RT', 'Pasa-Tolic L', 'Zhu Y']","['Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354 United States.', 'Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354 United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354 United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354 United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354 United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354 United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354 United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354 United States.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354 United States.', 'Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354 United States.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah 84602, United States.', 'Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354 United States.', 'Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354 United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,,IM,"['Analytic Sample Preparation Methods/*methods', 'Automation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Liquid/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Nanotechnology/*methods', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods']",,,2020/07/09 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.0c01551 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2020 Aug 4;92(15):10588-10596. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.0c01551.

CASE DESCRIPTION: In a university hospital in Southern Brazil, a 3-year-old female was diagnosed with acute monocytic leukemia with normal karyotype. The chemotherapy regimen was initiated, and she achieved complete remission six months later, relapsing after four months with a complex karyotype involving chromosomes 8p and 16q. The bone marrow showed vacuolated blasts with a monocytic aspect and evidence of hemophagocytosis. The child presented progressive clinical deterioration and died two months after the relapse. COMMENTS: HLH is a rare and aggressive inflammatory condition characterized by cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly, fever, and hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Although rare, malignancy-associated HLH (M-HLH) is fatal. The patient in this case report met five out of the eight established criteria for HLH. The evolution of the patient's karyotype, regardless of the diagnostic profile, seemed secondary to the treatment for acute monocytic leukemia. In this case, the cytogenetic instability might have influenced the abnormal behavior of leukemic cells. This is a rare case of HLH in a child with acute monocytic leukemia.","['Farias, Mariela Granero', 'Freitas, Priscila Aparecida Correa', 'Spagnol, Fabiane', 'Souza, Meriene Viquetti de', 'Alegretti, Ana Paula', 'Riegel, Mariluce', 'Taniguchi, Adriano Nori Rodrigues', 'Daudt, Liane Esteves']","['Farias MG', 'Freitas PAC', 'Spagnol F', 'Souza MV', 'Alegretti AP', 'Riegel M', 'Taniguchi ANR', 'Daudt LE']","['Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.']","['por', 'eng']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Brazil,Rev Paul Pediatr,Revista paulista de pediatria : orgao oficial da Sociedade de Pediatria de Sao Paulo,9109353,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Brazil', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/diagnosis/*etiology/immunology/pathology']",,,2020/07/09 06:00,2021/05/12 06:00,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2019/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0103-05822021000100601 [pii]', '10.1590/1984-0462/2021/39/2019290 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Paul Pediatr. 2021;39:e2019290. doi: 10.1590/1984-0462/2021/39/2019290.

Here, we used targeted next-generation sequencing for testing the mutation patterns of Chinese leukemia patients. METHODS: We performed targeted sequencing of 504 tumor-related genes in 109 leukemia samples to identify single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions and deletions (INDELs). Pathogenic variants were assessed based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. The functional impact of pathogenic genes was explored through gene ontology (GO), pathway analysis, and protein-protein interaction network in silico. RESULTS: We identified a total of 4,655 SNVs and 614 INDELs in 419 genes, in which PDE4DIP, NOTCH2, FANCA, BCR, and ROS1 emerged as the highly mutated genes. Of note, we were the first to demonstrate an association of PDE4DIP mutation and leukemia. Based on ACMG guidelines, 39 pathogenic and likely pathogenic mutations in 27 genes were found. GO annotation showed that the biological process including gland development, leukocyte differentiation, respiratory system development, myeloid leukocyte differentiation, mesenchymal to epithelial transition, and so on were involved. CONCLUSION: Our study provided a map of gene mutations in Chinese patients with leukemia and gave insights into the molecular pathogenesis of leukemia.","['Yao, Hongxia', 'Wu, Congming', 'Chen, Yueqing', 'Guo, Li', 'Chen, Wenting', 'Pan, Yanping', 'Fu, Xiangjun', 'Wang, Guyun', 'Ding, Yipeng']","['Yao H', 'Wu C', 'Chen Y', 'Guo L', 'Chen W', 'Pan Y', 'Fu X', 'Wang G', 'Ding Y']","['Department of Hematology, Hainan General Hospital (Hainan Affiliated Hospital of Hainan Medical University), Haikou, Hainan, P.R.

Here, we evaluated SAMHD1 as potential biomarker for the response to high-dose cytarabine in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients. We quantified SAMHD1 protein expression and determined the mutation status in patients of the MCL Younger and Elderly trials (n = 189), who had received high-dose cytarabine- or fludarabine-based polychemotherapy. Additionally, we quantified SAMHD1 expression in B cell lymphoma cell lines and exposed them to cytarabine, fludarabine, and clinically relevant combinations. Across both trials investigated, SAMHD1 mutations had a frequency of 7.1% (n = 13) and did not significantly affect the failure-free survival (FFS, P = .47). In patients treated with high-dose cytarabine- or fludarabine-containing regimes, SAMHD1 expression was not significantly associated with FFS or complete remission rate. SAMHD1 expression in B cell lymphoma cell lines, however, inversely correlated with their in vitro response to cytarabine as single agent (R = .65, P = .0065). This correlation could be reversed by combining cytarabine with other chemotherapeutics, such as oxaliplatin and vincristine, similar to the treatment regime of the MCL Younger trial. We conclude that this might explain why we did not observe a significant association between SAMHD1 protein expression and the outcome of MCL patients upon cytarabine-based treatment.","['Roider,

Any typology of active job in U mines is associated with exposure to U and its decay products, such as radon (Rn), thorium (Th), and radium (Ra) and its decay products with alpha-emission and gamma radiation. Health effects in U miners have been investigated in several cohort studies in the USA, Canada, Germany, the Czech Republic, and France. While public opinion is particularly addressed to pay attention to the safety of nuclear facilities, health hazard associated with mining is poorly debated. According to the many findings from cohort studies, the most significant positive dose-response relationship was found between occupational U exposure and lung cancer. Other types of tumors associated with occupational U exposure are leukemia and lymphoid cancers. Furthermore, it was found increased but not statistically significant death risk in U miners due to cancers in the liver, stomach, and kidneys. So far, there has not been found a significant association between U exposure and increased cardiovascular mortality in U miners. This review tries to address the current state of the art of these studies.","['Semenova, Yuliya', 'Pivina, Lyudmila', 'Zhunussov, Yersin', 'Zhanaspayev, Marat', 'Chirumbolo, Salvatore', 'Muzdubayeva, Zhanna', 'Bjorklund, Geir']","['Semenova Y', 'Pivina L', 'Zhunussov Y', 'Zhanaspayev M', 'Chirumbolo S', 'Muzdubayeva Z', 'Bjorklund G']","['Semey Medical University, Semey, Kazakhstan.', 'CONEM Kazakhstan Environmental Health and Safety Research Group, Semey Medical University, Semey, Kazakhstan.', 'Semey Medical University, Semey, Kazakhstan.', 'CONEM Kazakhstan Environmental Health and Safety Research Group, Semey Medical University, Semey, Kazakhstan.', 'Semey Medical University, Semey, Kazakhstan.', 'Semey Medical University, Semey, Kazakhstan.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'CONEM Scientific, Verona, Italy.', 'Semey Medical University, Semey, Kazakhstan.', 'Council for Nutritional and Environmental Medicine (CONEM), Toften 24, 8610, Mo i Rana, Norway. bjorklund@conem.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,Environmental science and pollution research international,9441769,"['4OC371KSTK (Uranium)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",IM,"['Canada', 'Czech Republic', 'France', 'Germany', 'Humans', '*Lung Neoplasms', '*Occupational Diseases', '*Occupational Exposure', '*Radon', '*Uranium']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancers', 'Occupational cohorts', 'Radon exposure', 'Uranium miners']",2020/07/09 06:00,2020/08/29 06:00,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2020/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11356-020-09590-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s11356-020-09590-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2020 Oct;27(28):34808-34822. doi: 10.1007/s11356-020-09590-7.

Among the pharmaceuticals used in the treatment protocols for ALL, Asparaginase (ASNase) from Escherichia coli (EcAII) is an essential biodrug. Meanwhile, the use of EcAII in neoplastic treatments causes several side effects, such as immunological reactions, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, depression, and coagulation abnormalities. Commercial EcAII is expressed as a recombinant protein, similar to novel enzymes from different organisms; in fact, EcAII is a tetrameric enzyme with high molecular weight (140 kDa), and its overexpression in recombinant systems often results in bacterial cell death or the production of aggregated or inactive EcAII protein, which is related to the formation of inclusion bodies. On the other hand, several commercial expression strains have been developed to overcome these expression issues, but no studies on a systematic evaluation of the E. coli strains aiming to express recombinant asparaginases have been performed to date. In this study, we evaluated eleven expression strains at a low temperature (16 degrees C) with different characteristics to determine which is the most appropriate for asparaginase expression; recombinant wild-type EcAII (rEcAII) was used as a prototype enzyme and the secondary structure content, oligomeric state, aggregation and specific activity of the enzymes were assessed. Structural analysis suggested that a correctly folded tetrameric rEcAII was obtained using ArcticExpress (DE3), a strain that co-express chaperonins, while all other strains produced poorly folded proteins. Additionally, the enzymatic assays showed high specific activity of proteins expressed by ArcticExpress (DE3) when compared to the other strains used in this work.","['de Moura, Werner Alfinito Feio', 'Schultz, Leonardo', 'Breyer, Carlos Alexandre', 'de Oliveira, Ana Laura Pires', 'Tairum, Carlos Abrunhosa', 'Fernandes, Gabriella Costa', 'Toyama, Marcos Hikari', 'Pessoa-Jr, Adalberto', 'Monteiro, Gisele', 'de Oliveira, Marcos Antonio']","['de Moura WAF', 'Schultz L', 'Breyer CA', 'de Oliveira ALP', 'Tairum CA', 'Fernandes GC', 'Toyama MH', 'Pessoa-Jr A', 'Monteiro G', 'de Oliveira MA']","['Institute of Biosciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Coastal Campus, Sao Vicente, Sao Paulo, 11330-900, Brazil.', 'Institute of Biosciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Coastal Campus, Sao Vicente, Sao Paulo, 11330-900, Brazil.', 'Institute of Biosciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Coastal Campus, Sao Vicente, Sao Paulo, 11330-900, Brazil.', 'Institute of Biosciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Coastal Campus, Sao Vicente, Sao Paulo, 11330-900, Brazil.', 'Institute of Biosciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Coastal Campus, Sao Vicente, Sao Paulo, 11330-900, Brazil.', 'Institute of Biosciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Coastal Campus, Sao Vicente, Sao Paulo, 11330-900, Brazil.', 'Institute of Biosciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Coastal Campus, Sao Vicente, Sao Paulo, 11330-900, Brazil.', 'Biochemical-Pharmaceutical Technology Department, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, 05508-000, Brazil.', 'Biochemical-Pharmaceutical Technology Department, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, 05508-000, Brazil.', 'Institute of Biosciences, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Coastal Campus, Sao Vicente, Sao Paulo, 11330-900, Brazil. marcos.a.oliveira@unesp.br.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biotechnol Lett,Biotechnology letters,8008051,"['0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Cold Temperature', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/chemistry/classification/*enzymology', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Secondary']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', 'Escherichia coli ASNaseII (EcAII)', 'Functional and structural evaluation', 'Low temperature expression', 'Recombinant enzyme']",2020/07/09 06:00,2021/07/06 06:00,['2020/07/09 06:00'],"['2020/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10529-020-02955-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s10529-020-02955-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Lett. 2020 Nov;42(11):2333-2344. doi: 10.1007/s10529-020-02955-5.

The scarcity of diseased cells, particularly in residual disease after treatment, demands highly sensitive detection approaches or the ability to enrich the diseased cells in relation to normal cells. We report a label-free microfluidic approach to enrich leukemia cells from healthy cells using inherent differences in cell biophysical properties. The microfluidic device consists of a channel with an array of diagonal ridges that recurrently compress and translate flowing cells in proportion to cell stiffness. Using devices optimized for acute T cell leukemia model Jurkat, the stiffer white blood cells were translated orthogonally to the channel length, while softer leukemia cells followed hydrodynamic flow. The device enriched Jurkat leukemia cells from white blood cells with an enrichment factor of over 760. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the device were found to be > 0.8 . The values of sensitivity and specificity could be adjusted by selecting one or multiple outlets for analysis. We demonstrate that low levels of Jurkat leukemia cells (1 in 10 4 white blood cells) could be more quickly detected using flow cytometry by using the stiffness sorting pre-enrichment. In a second mode of operation, the device was implemented to sort resistive leukemia cells from both drug-sensitive leukemia cells and normal white blood cells. Therefore, microfluidic biomechanical sorting can be a useful tool to enrich leukemia cells that may improve downstream analyses.","['Islam, Muhymin', 'Raj, Abhishek', 'McFarland, Brynn', 'Brink, Hannah Maxine', 'Ciciliano, Jordan', 'Fay, Meredith', 'Myers, David Richard', 'Flowers, Christopher', 'Waller, Edmund K', 'Lam, Wilbur', 'Alexeev, Alexander', 'Sulchek, Todd']","['Islam M', 'Raj A', 'McFarland B', 'Brink HM', 'Ciciliano J', 'Fay M', 'Myers DR', 'Flowers C', 'Waller EK', 'Lam W', 'Alexeev A', 'Sulchek T']","['George W.
