Heterogeneous genetic etiology, together with the potential for oligoclonality within the individual patient, have made the identification of a single high-sensitivity marker of disease burden challenging. We developed a multiple gene measurable residual disease (MG-MRD) RQ-PCR array for the high-sensitivity detection of AML, retrospectively tested on 74 patients who underwent allo-SCT at the NHLBI in the period 1994-2012. MG-MRD testing on peripheral blood samples prior to transplantation demonstrated excellent concordance with traditional BM-based evaluation and improved risk stratification for post-transplant relapse and OS outcomes. Pre-SCT assessment by MG-MRD predicted all clinical relapses occurring in the first 100 days after allo-SCT compared with 57% sensitivity using WT1 RQ-PCR alone. Nine patients who were negative for WT1 prior to transplantation were correctly reclassified into a high-risk MG-MRD-positive group, associated with 100% post-transplant mortality. This study provides proof of principle that a multiple gene approach may be superior to the use of WT1 expression alone for AML residual disease detection.","['Goswami, M', 'McGowan, K S', 'Lu, K', 'Jain, N', 'Candia, J', 'Hensel, N F', 'Tang, J', 'Calvo, K R', 'Battiwalla, M', 'Barrett, A J', 'Hourigan, C S']","['Goswami M', 'McGowan KS', 'Lu K', 'Jain N', 'Candia J', 'Hensel NF', 'Tang J', 'Calvo KR', 'Battiwalla M', 'Barrett AJ', 'Hourigan CS']","['Myeloid Malignancies Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Myeloid Malignancies Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Stem Cell Allogenic Transplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Stem Cell Allogenic Transplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '1] Department of Physics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA [2] School of Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Stem Cell Allogenic Transplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Myeloid Malignancies Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Stem Cell Allogenic Transplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Stem Cell Allogenic Transplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Myeloid Malignancies Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 CA154274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA HL006163-01/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA HL006163-02/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA154274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20150209,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/blood', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",PMC4424111,['NIHMS651361'],2015/02/11 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2014/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2014326 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2014.326 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2015 May;50(5):642-51. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2014.326.

Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals were estimated and pooled. Our search yielded 36 trials. The median follow-up was 55 (range 12-144) months. Overall, the RR for developing SMs was 1.23 ((0.97-1.55), I(2)=4%, 9870 patients). Subgroup analysis of trials assessing TBI-containing preparative regimens and of patients with baseline lymphoproliferative diseases, showed there was a higher risk for SMs in patients given autografts (RR=1.61 (1.05-2.48), I(2)=14%, 2218 patients and RR=1.62 (1.12-2.33), I(2)=22%, 3343 patients, respectively). Among all patients, there was a higher rate of myelodysplastic syndrome MDS/AML in patients given HCT compared with other treatments (RR=1.71 (1.18-2.48), I(2)=0%, 8778 patients). The risk of secondary solid malignancies was comparable in the short term between patients given HCT and patients given other treatments (RR=0.95 (0.67-1.32), I(2)=0%, 5925 patients). We conclude that overall the risk of secondary MDS/AML is higher in patients given autologous HCT compared with other treatments. In the subgroup of patients given a TBI-based regimen and in those with a baseline lymphoproliferative disease, there was a higher risk of overall SMs.","['Vaxman, I', 'Ram, R', 'Gafter-Gvili, A', 'Vidal, L', 'Yeshurun, M', 'Lahav, M', 'Shpilberg, O']","['Vaxman I', 'Ram R', 'Gafter-Gvili A', 'Vidal L', 'Yeshurun M', 'Lahav M', 'Shpilberg O']","['1] Medicine A, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel [2] Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', '1] Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel [2] BMT Unit, Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', '1] Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel [2] Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', '1] Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel [2] Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', '1] Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel [2] Institute of Hematology, Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', '1] Medicine A, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel [2] Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', '1] Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel [2] Institute of Hematology, Assuta Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20150209,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Autografts', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects']",,,2015/02/11 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2014/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2014325 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2014.325 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2015 May;50(5):706-14. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2014.325.

Leukemia cells exhibit a dysregulated developmental program as the result of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Overexpression of the RNA-binding protein Musashi2 (MSI2) has been previously shown to predict poor survival in leukemia. Here, we demonstrated that conditional deletion of Msi2 in the hematopoietic compartment results in delayed leukemogenesis, reduced disease burden, and a loss of LSC function in a murine leukemia model. Gene expression profiling of these Msi2-deficient animals revealed a loss of the hematopoietic/leukemic stem cell self-renewal program and an increase in the differentiation program. In acute myeloid leukemia patients, the presence of a gene signature that was similar to that observed in Msi2-deficent murine LSCs correlated with improved survival. We determined that MSI2 directly maintains the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) self-renewal program by interacting with and retaining efficient translation of Hoxa9, Myc, and Ikzf2 mRNAs. Moreover, depletion of MLL target Ikzf2 in LSCs reduced colony formation, decreased proliferation, and increased apoptosis. Our data provide evidence that MSI2 controls efficient translation of the oncogenic LSC self-renewal program and suggest MSI2 as a potential therapeutic target for myeloid leukemia.","['Park, Sun-Mi', 'Gonen, Mithat', 'Vu, Ly', 'Minuesa, Gerard', 'Tivnan, Patrick', 'Barlowe, Trevor S', 'Taggart, James', 'Lu, Yuheng', 'Deering, Raquel P', 'Hacohen, Nir', 'Figueroa, Maria E', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Fernandez, Hugo F', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Levine, Ross', 'Leslie, Christina', 'Lengner, Christopher J', 'Kharas, Michael G']","['Park SM', 'Gonen M', 'Vu L', 'Minuesa G', 'Tivnan P', 'Barlowe TS', 'Taggart J', 'Lu Y', 'Deering RP', 'Hacohen N', 'Figueroa ME', 'Paietta E', 'Fernandez HF', 'Tallman MS', 'Melnick A', 'Levine R', 'Leslie C', 'Lengner CJ', 'Kharas MG']",,['eng'],"['U24-CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA180827/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180801/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA16865/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK101989-01A1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K01DK084261-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA180801/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA193842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA180794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA180791/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180827/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA196172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK101989/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 DK084261/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180791/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA189859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150209,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Transcriptome']",PMC4362230,,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2014/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['78440 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI78440 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2015 Mar 2;125(3):1286-98. doi: 10.1172/JCI78440.

We aimed to evaluate the serum level of CA15.3 in carriers of beta-thalassemia by comparing them with cancer patients and healthy individuals. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was done from February to December 2011 in Southern Iran. Participants consisted of 32 subjects with beta-thalassemia minor, 49 with cancer and 25 healthy individuals. The serum levels of CA15.3 were measured and compared in different groups. RESULTS: The serum levels of CA 15.3 in all participants were in the normal range (<35 U/mL). Also it did not significantly differ among various groups of the participants (p=0.723). Age was not significantly correlated with the serum level of CA 15.3 (r= 0.039, p=0.702). The most frequent cancer in the group of patients with malignancies was hematologic malignancies (96%) with the highest frequency for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (37 patients). Frequency of thalassemia minor in patients with cancer was 11 (22.4%). CONCLUSION: No correlation was found between CA 15.3 serum level with beta-thalssemia minor or with childhood malignancies. Compared to general population, a high proportion of beta-thalssemia minor was observed in patients with cancer in our study. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between cancer and beta-thalassemia minor accurately.","['Shahriari, Mahdi', 'Haghpanah, Sezaneh', 'Dehghani, Javad', 'Dehbozorgian, Javad', 'Eatemadfar, Peyman', 'Bazrafshan, Asghar', 'Karimi, Mehran']","['Shahriari M', 'Haghpanah S', 'Dehghani J', 'Dehbozorgian J', 'Eatemadfar P', 'Bazrafshan A', 'Karimi M']","['1.

Emerging evidence suggests that TLRs play important roles in cancer progression, invasion and immune evasion, whereas whether TLRs have any role in PTC remains to be clarified. In this study, we found that TLR3 was present in both PTC specimen and various thyroid cancer cell lines. Further IHC analysis of 63 PTC patients revealed that TLR3 expression was associated with cervical metastasis, but not correlated with patients' TNM staging, extrathyroidal invasion. In addition, TLR3 promoted migration of K1 cells in vitro. Activation of TLR3 increased cancer stem cell marker and migration promoting CD44 expression in vitro, indicating that TLR3 might promote metastasis of PTC via modulating CD44 expression. Taken together, our data revealed that TLR3 is correlated with cervical metastasis of PTC and might be an essential prognostic indicator and target for PTC metastasis.","['Li, Dapeng', 'Gu, Runxia', 'Yang, Xiaoyong', 'Hu, Chuanxiang', 'Li, Yigong', 'Gao, Ming', 'Yu, Yang']","['Li D', 'Gu R', 'Yang X', 'Hu C', 'Li Y', 'Gao M', 'Yu Y']","['Department of Thyroid and Neck Tumor, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer Tianjin, China ; Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy Tianjin, China.', 'Leukemia Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Thyroid and Neck Tumor, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer Tianjin, China ; Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Thyroid and Neck Tumor, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer Tianjin, China ; Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Thyroid and Neck Tumor, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer Tianjin, China ; Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Thyroid and Neck Tumor, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer Tianjin, China ; Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Thyroid and Neck Tumor, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer Tianjin, China ; Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141215,United States,Int J Clin Exp Med,International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,101471010,,,PMC4307459,,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/02/11 06:01,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2014/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Med. 2014 Dec 15;7(12):5111-7. eCollection 2014.,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD44', 'Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC)', 'Toll-like receptor (TLR)', 'metastasis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous reports have documented the crosstalk between SIRT1 with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) signaling in leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. In this study, the purpose was to survey the regulatory effects of SIRT1 on gastric cancer (GC) cells (AGS and MKN-45) and the relationships between SIRT1 and activation of STAT3 and NF-kappaB in GC cells. We found the SIRT1 activator (resveratrol RSV) contributed to the repression of viability and increase of senescence, which were rescued by SIRT1 inhibitor (nicotinamide NA) and SIRT1 depletion by CCK-8 assay and SA-beta-gal assay respectively. Further study found SIRT1 activation (RSV supplement) not only inhibited the activation of STAT3 including STAT3 mRNA level, c-myc mRNA level phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) proteins and acetylizad STAT3 (acSTAT3) proteins, but also repression of pNF-kappaB p65 and acNF-kappaB p65. NA reversed the effects of RSV. In addition, either RSV or NA application could not change the cellular viability and senescence in MKN-45 cells with STAT3 knockdown or NF-kappaB knockdown. Overall, our findings suggested SIRT1 activation could induced the loss of viability and increases of senescence in GC in vitro. Moreover, our observations revealed SIRT1 displayed growth inhibitory activity in GC cells highly associated with causing repression of activation of STAT3 and NF-kappaB proteins via deacetylation.","['Lu, Juanjuan', 'Zhang, Liping', 'Chen, Xiang', 'Lu, Qiming', 'Yang, Yuxia', 'Liu, Jingping', 'Ma, Xin']","['Lu J', 'Zhang L', 'Chen X', 'Lu Q', 'Yang Y', 'Liu J', 'Ma X']","['Department of Digestive Disease, Gansu Provincial Hospital 160 Donggang West Road, Lanzhou 730000, China.', 'Department of Digestive Disease, Gansu Provincial Hospital 160 Donggang West Road, Lanzhou 730000, China.', 'Department of Digestive Disease, Gansu Provincial Hospital 160 Donggang West Road, Lanzhou 730000, China.', 'Department of Digestive Disease, Gansu Provincial Hospital 160 Donggang West Road, Lanzhou 730000, China.', 'Department of Digestive Disease, Gansu Provincial Hospital 160 Donggang West Road, Lanzhou 730000, China.', 'Department of Digestive Disease, Gansu Provincial Hospital 160 Donggang West Road, Lanzhou 730000, China.', 'Department of Digestive Disease, Gansu Provincial Hospital 160 Donggang West Road, Lanzhou 730000, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141215,United States,Int J Clin Exp Med,International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,101471010,,,PMC4307451,,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/02/11 06:01,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2014/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Med. 2014 Dec 15;7(12):5050-8. eCollection 2014.,,['NOTNLM'],"['NF-kappaB', 'STAT3', 'Sirtuin-1', 'acetylation', 'activation', 'gastric cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surviving leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and progenitor cells are a potential source for CML relapse and progression.

However, whether the level of IL1RAP is associated with clinical phases of CML, and correlations between IL1RAP expression and detections of diagnosis is still unclear. Here we demonstrated that IL1RAP was up-regulated in CD34+ and CD34+CD38- cells which highly enriched with stem cells. Furthermore, IL1RAP expression in CD34+CD38- cells was tightly consistent with the generation of BCR-ABL fusion gene and Philadelphia chromosome. Importantly, we found that the level of IL1RAP increased with disease progression from chronic phase (CP) into accelerated phase (AP) and blast phase (BP), which was investigated not only in new diagnosed CML patients but also in patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and hydroxyurea. Negative correlation was detected between IL1RAP expression and neutrophil (NE), whereas no relation was found in white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte (LY), red blood cell (RBC), platelet (PLT), age or gender of CML patients.

TSPO is associated with a number of biological processes, including apoptosis, the regulation of cellular proliferation, porphyrin transport and heme biosynthesis, immunomodulation, anion transport and the regulation of steroidogenesis. Thus, numerous studies have proposed TSPO as a promising target for novel therapeutic agents, particularly for the treatment of cancer. In the present study, the response of 30 consecutive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients to bendamustine and rituximab treatment was evaluated according to TSPO expression levels. Furthermore, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and nitric oxide (NO) levels, as well as caspase-3 activity were determined. Compared with the lymphocytes of healthy donors, the 30 consecutive CLL patients exhibited increased TSPO expression levels, decreased TBARS and NO levels and reduced caspase-3 activity. Six months after the treatment commenced, the TSPO/mitochondria ratio resembled that of the healthy controls in 24/30 CLL patients. In addition, an increase in TBARS and NO levels, two markers of oxidative stress, and a potentiation of caspase-3 activity in all responder patients was observed. Notably, the six patients who appeared to be resistant to treatment also displayed higher TSPO levels, and lower caspase-3 activity and TBARS levels. These data indicate that TSPO expression may be a molecular prognostic factor in CLL patients.","['DE Rosa, Aniello', 'Zappavigna, Silvia', 'Villa, Maria Rosaria', 'Improta, Salvatore', 'Cesario, Elena', 'Mastrullo, Lucia', 'Caraglia, Michele', 'Stiuso, Paola']","['DE Rosa A', 'Zappavigna S', 'Villa MR', 'Improta S', 'Cesario E', 'Mastrullo L', 'Caraglia M', 'Stiuso P']","['Local Sanitary Agency, Naples 3 Southern, Torre del Grecco, Naples I-80059, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, Second University of Naples, Naples I-80138, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, San Gennaro Hospital, Naples I-80131, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, San Gennaro Hospital, Naples I-80131, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, Second University of Naples, Naples I-80138, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, San Gennaro Hospital, Naples I-80131, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, Second University of Naples, Naples I-80138, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, Second University of Naples, Naples I-80138, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141219,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,PMC4315100,,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/02/11 06:01,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2014/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2014.2817 [doi]', 'ol-09-03-1327 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2015 Mar;9(3):1327-1332. doi: 10.3892/ol.2014.2817.

Furthermore, multivalent interactions between the scaffold and other signaling proteins contribute to the formation of protein microclusters. Such microclusters are prominent in early T cell signaling. Here, we explored the minimal structural requirement for a scaffold protein by coupling multiple copies of a proline-rich peptide corresponding to an interaction motif for the SH3 domain of the adaptor protein GADS to an N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide polymer backbone. When added to GADS-containing cell lysates, these scaffolds (but not individual peptides) promoted the binding of GADS to peptide microarrays. This can be explained by the cross-linking of GADS into larger complexes. Furthermore, following import into Jurkat T cell leukemia cells, this synthetic scaffold enhanced the formation of microclusters of signaling proteins.","['Witsenburg, J Joris', 'Sinzinger, Michael D', 'Stoevesandt, Oda', 'Ruttekolk, Ivo R', 'Roth, Gunter', 'Adjobo-Hermans, Merel J W', 'Brock, Roland']","['Witsenburg JJ', 'Sinzinger MD', 'Stoevesandt O', 'Ruttekolk IR', 'Roth G', 'Adjobo-Hermans MJ', 'Brock R']","['Department of Biochemistry (286), Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Centre, Geert Grooteplein 28, 6525 GA Nijmegen (The Netherlands).']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150206,Germany,Chembiochem,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Peptides/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Polymethacrylic Acids/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Proline/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'src Homology Domains']",,,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2014/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbic.201402622 [doi]'],ppublish,Chembiochem. 2015 Mar 2;16(4):602-10. doi: 10.1002/cbic.201402622.

Green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has anti-cancer and DNA demethylating properties with no significant toxicity toward normal cells. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a combination of non-toxic, low dose of 5-aza 2' dC with EGCG, on growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. Human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB 231) and non-tumorigenic MCF-10A breast epithelial cells were treated with either 5-aza 2' dC, EGCG, or their combination for 7 days. Cell growth inhibition was determined by cell count, cell viability, cell cycle, and soft agar assay, whereas genes expression changes were determined by quantitative real-time PCR and/or Western blot analysis. Histone modifications and global DNA methylation changes were determined by Western blot and RAPD-PCR, respectively. The results revealed significantly greater inhibition of growth of breast cancer cells by co-treatment with 5-aza 2' dC and EGCG compared to individual treatments, whereas it has no significant toxicity to MCF-10A cells. This was further confirmed by gene expression analysis. Changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications were also greater in cells with combination treatment. Findings of this study suggest that potentiation of growth inhibition of breast cancer cells by 5-aza 2' dC and EGCG combination treatment, at least in part, is mediated by epigenetic mechanism.","['Tyagi, Tulika', 'Treas, Justin N', 'Mahalingaiah, Prathap Kumar S', 'Singh, Kamaleshwar P']","['Tyagi T', 'Treas JN', 'Mahalingaiah PK', 'Singh KP']","['Department of Environmental Toxicology, The Institute of Environmental and Human Health (TIEHH), Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, 79409, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150208,Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,IM,"['Azacitidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Catechin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Plant Extracts/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique', 'Tea/chemistry']",,,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2014/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10549-015-3295-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2015 Feb;149(3):655-68. doi: 10.1007/s10549-015-3295-5.

The present study offers novel insights into the mechanism by which BITC inhibits bCSC. Flow cytometry and mammosphere assay were performed to quantify bCSC fraction. Protein expression was determined by western blotting. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry using Annexin V-propidium iodide method. Cell migration was determined by Boyden chamber assay. BITC treatment resulted in a marked decrease in protein level of polycomb group protein B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 (Bmi-1) in cultured human breast cancer cells (MCF-7, SUM159, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-361) and MDA-MB-231 xenografts in vivo. Overexpression (MCF-7) or knockdown (SUM159, and MDA-MB-231) of Bmi-1 protein had no meaningful impact on the BITC's ability to inhibit cell viability and cell migration and/or induce apoptosis. On the other hand, inhibition of bCSC markers (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 activity and mammosphere frequency) resulting from BITC exposure was significantly altered by Bmi-1 overexpression and knockdown. BITC was previously shown to cause activation of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4 in association with induction of gamma-secretase complex component Nicastrin, which are also implicated in maintenance of cancer stemness. BITC-mediated inhibition of bCSC was augmented by knockdown of Notch4 and Nicastrin, but not by RNA interference of Notch1 or Notch2. The present study highlights important roles for Bmi-1 and Notch4 in BITC-mediated suppression of bCSC.","['Kim, Su-Hyeong', 'Singh, Shivendra V']","['Kim SH', 'Singh SV']","['Department of Pharmacology & Chemical Biology, and University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, 2.32A Hillman Cancer Center Research Pavilion, 5117 Centre Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA047904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129347/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150208,Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Lepidium sativum/chemistry', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor, Notch4', 'Receptors, Notch/biosynthesis/*genetics']",PMC4329083,['NIHMS661052'],2015/02/11 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2014/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10549-015-3279-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2015 Feb;149(3):681-92. doi: 10.1007/s10549-015-3279-5.

PROCEDURE: Eligibility for this retrospective cohort study included: (i) previous enrollment on legacy therapy trials CCG1922 or CCG1952; (ii) continuous first remission; and (iii) age at follow-up evaluation of 6-16.99 years. Height and weight from diagnosis, consolidation, start of maintenance, last cycle of maintenance, and off-therapy were analyzed. RESULTS: The 269 subjects were a median age of 3.5 years at diagnosis and 13.3 years at follow-up. BMI% significantly increased from induction to consolidation (+17.6 +/- 1.6%), start of maintenance to end-of-treatment (+3.3 +/- 1.6%) and decreased from end-of-treatment to follow-up (-3.5 +/- 1.6%,). Higher BMI% at follow-up was associated with higher BMI% at diagnosis (P < 0.0001), but not age at diagnosis, gender, or race. Patients previously randomized to dexamethasone had a stronger association between BMI% at diagnosis and BMI% at follow-up than those who received prednisone (P = 0.0005). At follow-up, 39% of survivors were overweight or obese; the relative risk of overweight/obese was 1.028 (P = 0.738) compared to the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of patients with SR-ALL found a significant increase in BMI% largely during the first month of therapy that is greater with dexamethasone than prednisone. However, after therapy, there was no increased risk of overweight/obese BMI compared to non-cancer peers.","['Lindemulder, Susan J', 'Stork, Linda C', 'Bostrom, Bruce', 'Lu, Xiaomin', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Hunger, Stephen', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Kadan-Lottick, Nina S']","['Lindemulder SJ', 'Stork LC', 'Bostrom B', 'Lu X', 'Devidas M', 'Hunger S', 'Neglia JP', 'Kadan-Lottick NS']","[""Oregon Health & Science University, Doernbecher Children's Hospital, Portland, OR.""]",['eng'],"['U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA095861/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA189955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20150207,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Overweight/*etiology', 'Pediatric Obesity/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Survivors']",PMC4405430,['NIHMS653494'],2015/02/11 06:00,2015/07/23 06:00,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2014/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25411 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jun;62(6):1035-41. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25411.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can improve cure rates, however relapse is still common. Recent studies demonstrate the activity of FLT3 inhibitors, including sorafenib, in targeting the underlying mutation. PROCEDURE: We conducted a retrospective study of 15 pediatric patients with FLT3/ITD+ AML treated with sorafenib within 18 months after receiving HSCT. Sorafenib was administered either as prophylaxis in patients considered at very high risk for relapse (n = 6) or at the time of disease recurrence (n = 9). RESULTS: Sorafenib was initiated at a median of 100 days post HSCT. Overall, 11/15 (73%) of patients experienced medically significant toxicities. Among patients who experienced toxicity, 6/11 (55%) received treatment at doses above what was later determined to be the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib for pediatric leukemia. Importantly, sorafenib did not appear to exacerbate graft versus host disease. Our findings suggest that sorafenib may be of particular efficacy in patients with minimal residual disease (MRD); all patients who received sorafenib for MRD immediately prior to transplant or with emergence post-HSCT are alive and remain in complete remission at a median of 48 months post HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: Our case series suggests that sorafenib administration is feasible and tolerable in pediatric FLT3/ITD+ AML patients early post HSCT. Ongoing prospective controlled studies are needed to further define the dosing of sorafenib in the post-HSCT period and to determine the optimal context for this treatment approach.","['Tarlock, Katherine', 'Chang, Bill', 'Cooper, Todd', 'Gross, Thomas', 'Gupta, Sumit', 'Neudorf, Steven', 'Adlard, Kathleen', 'Ho, Phoenix A', 'McGoldrick, Suzanne', 'Watt, Tanya', 'Templeman, Tina', 'Sisler, India', 'Garee, Amy', 'Thomson, Blythe', 'Woolfrey, Ann', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Pollard, Jessica A']","['Tarlock K', 'Chang B', 'Cooper T', 'Gross T', 'Gupta S', 'Neudorf S', 'Adlard K', 'Ho PA', 'McGoldrick S', 'Watt T', 'Templeman T', 'Sisler I', 'Garee A', 'Thomson B', 'Woolfrey A', 'Estey E', 'Meshinchi S', 'Pollard JA']","[""Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150208,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Niacinamide/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Phenylurea Compounds/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sorafenib', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/07/29 06:00,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2014/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25437 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jun;62(6):1048-54. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25437.

The distribution of macrophages in lymph node samples was found to be associated with the prognosis of lymphoma patients. However, the role of macrophages in leukemia and their functional and phenotypic characteristics in hematopoietic malignancies have not been defined. In this study, we examined the distribution and functional and phenotypic characteristics of macrophages in a Notch1-induced mouse model of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The distribution of macrophages in bone marrow (BM) and spleen, which are proposed as BM and spleen leukemia-associated macrophages (LAMs), were different during the development of leukemia. LAMs stimulated the proliferation of T-ALL cells and had higher migration activity. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that gene expression profiles of BM and spleen LAMs showed considerable differences. RT-PCR analysis showed that LAMs expressed both M1- and M2-associated phenotypic genes, but they expressed much lower levels of TGF-beta1, VEGF-A, and CSF-1 than did tumor-associated macrophages from B16 melanoma. Furthermore, spleen LAMs more potently stimulated the proliferation of T-ALL cells compared with BM LAMs. Moreover, LAMs could be subdivided into M1-like (CD206(-)) and M2-like (CD206(+)) groups.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Injection of bovine or human ovarian cortex fragments with cells from different cancer types led to the formation of proliferating tumour masses and newly formed small metastatic lesions. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Autotransplantation of ovarian tissue comes with the major concern of cancer cells possibly being present in the tissue. A model system to develop strategies aimed at enhancing the safety of ovarian tissue autotransplantation is currently lacking. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The ability of injected human leukaemia, lymphoma, Ewing's sarcoma or breast cancer cells to proliferate and form tumour-like structures in bovine and human ovarian cortex tissue in vitro was assessed. The injected cells were from human cancer cell lines. After 4 days of culture, some tissue fragments were harvested for standard histological staining and immunohistochemical staining of tumour cell specific antigens and the Ki67 proliferation marker, while the remaining fragments were incubated for an additional 6 days (bovine tissue) or 3 days (human tissue) before analysis. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Experiments were performed with ovarian tissue from women after prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy. Bovine ovarian tissue was obtained at an abattoir. Glucose uptake during in vitro culture was monitored to quantify the viability of tissue. Tumour formation was assessed at Day 4 and Day 10 in bovine ovarian tissue and at Day 4 and Day 7 in human ovarian tissue, using histology and immunohistochemistry. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We found that bovine and human ovarian cortex tissue could be cultured for up to 10 and 7 days, respectively, without any loss of viability. Our preliminary results show that all cell lines tested were capable of forming proliferating tumours in ovarian cortex tissue in vitro. Lymphoma and breast cancer cells produced small metastases near the original lesions. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The tumour model presented was based on the growth of human cancer cell lines in ovarian cortex tissue. It is unknown whether these cells behave differently from malignant cells derived from primary tumours. In addition, the human ovarian tissue was derived from women over 39 years of age, which is obviously considerably older than patients opting for ovarian tissue cryopreservation. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our model system will facilitate the development of procedures to detect cancer cells in, or purge cancer cells from, human ovarian tissue.

As drug combination regimes often achieve greater therapeutic efficacy than monotherapies, here the trypanocidal activity of the cysteine protease inhibitor K11777 in combination with current anti-HAT drugs using bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei was investigated. Isobolographic analysis was used to determine the interaction between cysteine protease inhibitors (K11777, CA-074Me and CAA0225) and anti-HAT drugs (suramin, pentamidine, melarsoprol and eflornithine). Bloodstream forms of T. brucei were incubated in culture medium containing cysteine protease inhibitors or anti-HAT drugs alone or in combination at a 1:1 fixed-dose ratio. After 48 h incubation, live cells were counted, the 50% growth inhibition values determined and combination indices calculated. The general cytotoxicity of drug combinations was evaluated with human leukaemia HL-60 cells. Combinations of K11777 with suramin, pentamidine and melarsoprol showed antagonistic effects while with eflornithine a synergistic effect was observed. Whereas eflornithine antagonises with CA-074Me, an inhibitor inactivating the targeted TbCATL only under reducing conditions, it synergises with CAA0255, an inhibitor structurally related to CA-074Me which inactivates TbCATL independently of thiols. These findings indicate an essential role of thiols for the synergistic interaction between K11777 and eflornithine. Encouragingly, the K11777/eflornithine combination displayed higher trypanocidal than cytotoxic activity. The results of this study suggest that the combination of the cysteine protease inhibitor K11777 and eflornithine display promising synergistic trypanocidal activity that warrants further investigation of the drug combination as possible alternative treatment of HAT.","['Steverding, Dietmar']",['Steverding D'],"['BioMedical Research Centre, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom.

From the N- to C-terminus, Src contains a unique domain, an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, a protein-tyrosine kinase domain, and a regulatory tail. The chief phosphorylation sites of human Src include an activating pTyr419 that results from phosphorylation in the kinase domain by an adjacent Src molecule and an inhibitory pTyr530 in the regulatory tail that results from phosphorylation by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) or Chk (Csk homologous kinase). The oncogenic Rous sarcoma viral protein lacks the equivalent of Tyr530 and is constitutively activated. Inactive Src is stabilized by SH2 and SH3 domains on the rear of the kinase domain where they form an immobilizing and inhibitory clamp. Protein kinases including Src contain hydrophobic regulatory and catalytic spines and collateral shell residues that are required to assemble the active enzyme. In the inactive enzyme, the regulatory spine contains a kink or a discontinuity with a structure that is incompatible with catalysis. The conversion of inactive to active Src is accompanied by electrostatic exchanges involving the breaking and making of distinct sets of kinase domain salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Src-catalyzed protein phosphorylation requires the participation of two Mg(2+) ions. Although nearly all protein kinases possess a common K/E/D/D signature, each enzyme exhibits its unique variations of the protein-kinase reaction template. Bosutinib, dasatinib, and ponatinib are Src/multikinase inhibitors that are approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and vandetanib is approved for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer. The Src and BCR-Abl inhibitors saracatinib and AZD0424, along with the previous four drugs, are in clinical trials for a variety of solid tumors including breast and lung cancers. Both ATP and targeted therapeutic Src protein kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib and ponatinib make hydrophobic contacts with catalytic spine residues and form hydrogen bonds with hinge residues connecting the small and large kinase lobes.","['Roskoski, Robert Jr']",['Roskoski R Jr'],"['Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research, 3754 Brevard Road, Suite 116, Box 19, Horse Shoe, NC 28742-8814, United States.

This study determined: (i) whether there are differences in treatment delivered to minorities, and (ii) how these differences affect outcomes in AML. We hypothesize that differences in treatment explain some proportion of survival disparities. METHODS: We used California Cancer Registry data linked to hospital discharge abstracts for patients with AML (1998-2008). Logistic regression models estimated odds of treatment (chemotherapy and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplant) by race/ethnicity. Cox proportional hazard models estimated mortality by race after adjustment for treatment. RESULTS: We analyzed 11,084 records. Black race was associated with lower odds of chemotherapy [OR, 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61-0.91]. Black and Hispanic patients had decreased odds of transplant [(OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46-0.87); (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.89), respectively]. Black patients had increased hazard of mortality (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.25) compared with whites. Adjustment for receipt of any treatment resulted in decreased mortality (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00-1.20) for black patients. CONCLUSIONS: AML treatment differences for black patients explain some proportion of the disparity. Future AML disparities studies should investigate socioeconomic and other characteristics. IMPACT: Study findings may better elucidate drivers of disparities in AML.","['Patel, Manali I', 'Ma, Yifei', 'Mitchell, Beverly', 'Rhoads, Kim F']","['Patel MI', 'Ma Y', 'Mitchell B', 'Rhoads KF']","['Division Hematology and Oncology, Stanford University, Stanford, California. manalip@stanford.edu.', 'Department of Surgery, Stanford University, Stanford, California.

Fourteen individuals received statin therapy, and 37 patients received no statins. MR image analysts were blinded to participant identifiers. RESULTS: Individuals receiving statins were older and often had diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and hyperlipidemia (HLD). For those receiving statins, LVEF was 56.6% +/- 1.4% at baseline and 54.1% +/- 1.3% 6 months after initiating anthracycline treatment (P = 0.15). For those not receiving statins, LVEF was 57.5% +/- 1.4% at baseline and decreased to 52.4% +/- 1.2% over a similar 6-month interval (P = 0.0003). In a multivariable model accounting for age, sex, DM, HTN, HLD, and cumulative amount of anthracycline received, LVEF remained unchanged in participants receiving a statin (+1.1% +/- 2.6%) vs a -6.5% +/- 1.5% decline among those not receiving a statin (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the finding that individuals receiving statin therapy for prevention of cardiovascular disease may experience less deterioration in LVEF with early receipt of Anth-bC than individuals not receiving statins. Further studies with large numbers of participants are warranted to determine if statins protect against LVEF decline in patients receiving Anth-bC.","['Chotenimitkhun, Runyawan', ""D'Agostino, Ralph Jr"", 'Lawrence, Julia A', 'Hamilton, Craig A', 'Jordan, Jennifer H', 'Vasu, Sujethra', 'Lash, Timothy L', 'Yeboah, Joseph', 'Herrington, David M', 'Hundley, W Gregory']","['Chotenimitkhun R', ""D'Agostino R Jr"", 'Lawrence JA', 'Hamilton CA', 'Jordan JH', 'Vasu S', 'Lash TL', 'Yeboah J', 'Herrington DM', 'Hundley WG']","['Department of Cardiology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Cardiology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Cardiology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Cardiology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Cardiology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Cardiology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA; Department of Radiology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.

We specifically focused on the impact of dose reduction on patient outcomes. The patient cohort consisted of 128 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (</= 70 years) treated at 10 Israeli centers with front-line fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab. We defined reduced chemotherapy as two-thirds or less of the total indicated dose. Patients treated with rituximab were divided into two groups and compared: those who received full dosages of 375 mg/m(2) or 500 mg/m(2), and patients given less than six cycles with either dose. Overall and clinical complete response rates (92.8% and 70.4%), as well as toxicities and overall survival (median not reached at 6 years), were similar to other reported clinical trials, but progression-free survival was shorter (42.5 months). Almost 50% of patients had some dose reduction of chemotherapy, 21% receiving less than two-thirds of the indicated dose, while close to 30% did not complete six cycles of rituximab. Reduced doses of chemotherapy and rituximab were independently associated with shorter progression-free survival (hazard ratio 3.6, P<0.0001 for reduced chemotherapy; hazard ratio 2.5, P=0.003 for incomplete-treatment with rituximab). Achieving a complete response was associated with longer overall survival but was not linked to the given dose of chemoimmunotherapy. In younger physically fit patients, front-line fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab therapy in the ""real-life"" setting achieves long remissions (albeit shorter than in clinical trials) and prolonged overall survival. However, dose reductions are commonly administered and may impact outcome.","['Herishanu, Yair', 'Goldschmidt, Neta', 'Bairey, Osnat', 'Ruchlemer, Rosa', 'Fineman, Riva', 'Rahimi-Levene, Naomi', 'Shvidel, Lev', 'Tadmor, Tamar', 'Ariel, Aviv', 'Braester, Andrea', 'Shapiro, Mika', 'Joffe, Erel', 'Polliack, Aaron']","['Herishanu Y', 'Goldschmidt N', 'Bairey O', 'Ruchlemer R', 'Fineman R', 'Rahimi-Levene N', 'Shvidel L', 'Tadmor T', 'Ariel A', 'Braester A', 'Shapiro M', 'Joffe E', 'Polliack A']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150206,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",PMC4420215,,2015/02/11 06:00,2015/10/23 06:00,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2014/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.115808 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.115808 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 May;100(5):662-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.115808.

Previous studies investigating the association between MDR1 C3435T polymorphisms and risk of children with ALL reported controversial results. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to clarify the effect of MDR1 C3435T polymorphisms on risk of childhood ALL. The strength of the association was measured by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Nine studies were finally included, involving a total of 1462 cases and 1522 controls. There was no association between MDR1 C3435T polymorphism and children ALL risk in all of four models in overall populations (CT vs. CC: OR=0.86, 95% CI=0.65-1.15, P=0.310; TT vs. CC: OR=1.50, 95% CI=0.96-2.35, P=0.076; TT/CT vs. CC: OR=1.12, 95% CI=0.95-1.33, P=0.166; TT vs. CC/CT: OR=1.58, 95% CI=0.97-2.56, P=0.067). Subgroup analysis by race suggested that this association existed in Asians under the under the homozygote model and recessive model (TT vs. CC: OR=2.45, 95% CI=1.24-4.86, P=0.010; TT vs. CT/CC: OR=2.65, 95% CI=1.22-5.75, P=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests there was no association between MDR1 C3435T polymorphism and children ALL risk in overall populations, but significant association with an increased risk in Asians.","['Yue, Qingfang', 'Xiong, Bei', 'Chen, Lei', 'Chen, Ye', 'Bu, Fandan', 'Liu, Xinyue', 'Cheng, Fanjun']","['Yue Q', 'Xiong B', 'Chen L', 'Chen Y', 'Bu F', 'Liu X', 'Cheng F']","['Department of Hematology, The Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wuhan No. 1 Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, PR China.

DESIGN: Multicentre retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Retrospective chart review. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were included (9 males, 12 females). Median age at sarcoidosis diagnosis was 48 years (range: 24-68 years). In 14 cases, lymphoma occurred within a previously known sarcoidosis. Five patients received a concomitant diagnosis of sarcoidosis and lymphoma, whereas lymphoma preceded sarcoidosis in two patients. Three patients were diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and 18 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (n = 11), follicular lymphoma (n = 2), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 2), anaplastic large cell lymphoma ALK + (n = 1), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (n = 1) and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (n = 1)). Thirteen patients were alive and in complete remission. Median age at the time of diagnosis of sarcoidosis was lower in patients with concomitant lymphoma compared with patients with sarcoidosis preceding lymphoma (34 years vs. 51 years, P = 0.01). Patients presenting with DLBCL associated with sarcoidosis were compared with DLBCL without sarcoidosis. No statistical difference was found in the risk of death or progression between the two groups (P = 0.685). CONCLUSIONS: We report here the largest series of lymphoma associated sarcoidosis patients. As opposed to previous studies, we observed a predominance of patients with DLBCL. Our study confirms the concept of the sarcoidosis-lymphoma syndrome. Large B-cell lymphoma does not have a better prognosis when associated with sarcoidosis.","['Chalayer, E', 'Bachy, E', 'Occelli, P', 'Weiler, L', 'Faurie, P', 'Ghesquieres, H', 'Pavic, M', 'Broussolle, C', 'Seve, P']","['Chalayer E', 'Bachy E', 'Occelli P', 'Weiler L', 'Faurie P', 'Ghesquieres H', 'Pavic M', 'Broussolle C', 'Seve P']","['From the Service de Medecine Interne, Hopital Nord, CHU de Saint-Etienne, 42055 Saint-Etienne Cedex 2, France, chalayer@chu-st-etienne.fr.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, 165 Chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69495 Pierre Benite, France."", 'Pole Information Medicale Evaluation Recherche, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 162 Avenue Lacassagne, 69424 Lyon Cedex 3, France.', 'Service de Dermatologie, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, 165 Chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69495 Pierre Benite, France.', 'Centre Leon Berard, 28 Promenade Lea et Napoleon Bullukian, 69008 Lyon, France.', 'Centre Leon Berard, 28 Promenade Lea et Napoleon Bullukian, 69008 Lyon, France.', ""Service d'Hemato-oncologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke, 3001, 12 Avenue Nord, Sherbooke QC J1H 5N4, Canada and."", 'Service de Medecine Interne, Groupement Hospitalier Nord, Hopital de la Croix Rousse,103 Grande-Rue de la Croix-Rousse 69317 Lyon, France.', 'Service de Medecine Interne, Groupement Hospitalier Nord, Hopital de la Croix Rousse,103 Grande-Rue de la Croix-Rousse 69317 Lyon, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",20150205,England,QJM,QJM : monthly journal of the Association of Physicians,9438285,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoidosis/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Steroids/therapeutic use', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/02/11 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2014/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['hcv039 [pii]', '10.1093/qjmed/hcv039 [doi]']",ppublish,QJM. 2015 Nov;108(11):871-8. doi: 10.1093/qjmed/hcv039.

Two medium (<600 Da) hydrophobic molecules, cationic malachite green (MG) and neutral bromocresol purple (BCP), were investigated. While it was observed that the MG cation adsorbs onto the surface of the MEL cell, neutral BCP does not. It is suggested that an electrostatic interaction between the opposite charges of the cation and the MEL cell surface is the primary driving force for adsorption. Comparisons of adsorption density and free energy, measured at different pH and cell morphology, indicate that the interaction is predominantly through sialic acid carboxyl groups. MG cation adsorption densities have been determined as (0.6+/-0.3)x10(6) mum(-2) on the surface of undifferentiated MEL cells, and (1.8+/-0.5)x10(7) mum(-2) on differentiated MEL cells, while the deduced adsorption free energies are effectively identical (ca. -10.9+/-0.1 and -10.8+/-0.1 kcal mol(-1), respectively).

Expression of the p110delta catalytic subunit of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway is restricted to leukocytes, where it regulates proliferation, migration, and cytokine production. Here, in a mouse model of fully mismatched hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), we show that genetic inactivation of p110delta in T cells leads to milder GvHD, whereas GvL is preserved. Inactivation of p110delta in human lymphocytes reduced T cell allorecognition. We demonstrate that both allostimulation and granzyme B expression were dependent on p110delta in naive T cells, which are the main mediators of GvHD, whereas memory T cells were unaffected. Strikingly, p110delta is not mandatory for either naive or memory T cells to mediate GvL. Therefore, immunomodulation of selective naive T cell functions by p110delta inactivation improves the outcome of allogeneic HSCT.","['Doisne, Jean-Marc', 'Huber, Christian M', 'Okkenhaug, Klaus', 'Colucci, Francesco']","['Doisne JM', 'Huber CM', 'Okkenhaug K', 'Colucci F']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, Cambridge CB2 0SW, UK.

MA also plays a role in the incorporation of the viral envelope (Env) glycoproteins and can influence particle infectivity post-maturation and post-entry. A highly basic region of MA targets Gag to the plasma membrane via specific binding to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]. This binding also triggers exposure of an amino-terminal myristate moiety, which anchors Gag to the membrane. An MA mutant deficient for PI(4,5)P2 binding, 29KE/31KE, has been shown to mislocalize within the cell, leading to particle assembly in a multivesicular body compartment and defective release of cell-free particles in HeLa and 293T cells. Despite the defect in virus production in these cells, release of the 29KE/31KE mutant is not significantly reduced in primary T cells, macrophages and Jurkat T cells. 29KE/31KE virions also display an infectivity defect associated with impaired Env incorporation, irrespective of the producer cell line. Here we examine the properties of 29KE/31KE by analyzing compensatory mutations obtained by a viral adaptation strategy. The MA mutant 16EK restores virus release through enhanced membrane binding. 16EK also influences the infectivity defect, in combination with an additional MA mutant, 62QR. Additionally, the 29KE/31KE MA mutant displays a defect in proteolytic cleavage of the murine leukemia virus Env cytoplasmic tail in pseudotyped virions. Our findings elucidate the mechanism whereby an MA mutant defective in PI(4,5)P2 binding can be rescued and highlight the ability of MA to influence Env glycoprotein function.","['Tedbury, Philip R', 'Mercredi, Peter Y', 'Gaines, Christy R', 'Summers, Michael F', 'Freed, Eric O']","['Tedbury PR', 'Mercredi PY', 'Gaines CR', 'Summers MF', 'Freed EO']","['Virus-Cell Interaction Section, HIV Drug Resistance Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250, USA.', 'Virus-Cell Interaction Section, HIV Drug Resistance Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.

The most common form of treatment for CML is imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Although imatinib is an effective treatment for CML and most patients treated with imatinib do attain some form of remission, imatinib does not completely eradicate all leukemia cells, and if treatment is stopped, all patients eventually relapse (Cortes, 2005). In Kim (2008), the authors developed a mathematical model for the dynamics of CML under imatinib treatment that incorporates the anti-leukemia immune response, and in Paquin (2011), the authors used this mathematical model to study strategic treatment interruptions as a potential therapeutic strategy for CML patients. Although the authors presented the results of several numerical simulations in Paquin (2011), the studies in that work did not include the possibility of imatinib-resistant mutations or an initial population of imatinib-resistant leukemia cells. As resistance is a significant consideration in any drug treatment, it is important to study the efficacy of the strategic treatment interruption plan in the presence of imatinib resistance. In this work, we modify the delay differential equations model of Kim (2008), Paquin (2011) to include the possibility of imatinib resistance, and we analyze strategic treatment interruptions as a potential therapeutic tool in the case of patients with imatinib-resistance leukemia cells.","['Paquin, Dana', 'Sacco, David', 'Shamshoian, John']","['Paquin D', 'Sacco D', 'Shamshoian J']","['Department of Mathematics California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA 93442, USA.

More effective treatments are urgently needed. Survivin is an inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein with key roles in regulating cell division, proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore, high expression of Survivin has been associated with poor clinical outcome in AML. The survivin suppressant YM155 (Sepantronium Bromide) has pre-clinical activity against a range of solid cancers and leukemias, although data in AML is limited. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive pre-clinical evaluation of YM155 in paediatric AML. YM155 potently inhibited cell viability in a diverse panel of AML cell lines. All paediatric cell lines were particularly sensitive, with a median IC50 of 0.038 muM. Cell cycle analyses demonstrated concentration-dependent increases in a sub-G1 population with YM155 treatment, suggestive of apoptosis that was subsequently confirmed by an increase in annexin-V positivity. YM155-mediated apoptosis was confirmed across a panel of 8 diagnostic bone marrow samples from children with AML. Consistent with the proposed mechanism of action, YM155 treatment was associated with down-regulation of survivin mRNA and protein expression and induction of DNA damage. These data suggest that YM155-mediated inhibition of survivin is a potentially beneficial therapeutic strategy for AML, particularly paediatric disease, and warrants further evaluation.","['Smith, Amanda M', 'Little, Erica B', 'Zivanovic, Andjelija', 'Hong, Priscilla', 'Liu, Alfred K S', 'Burow, Rachel', 'Stinson, Caedyn', 'Hallahan, Andrew R', 'Moore, Andrew S']","['Smith AM', 'Little EB', 'Zivanovic A', 'Hong P', 'Liu AK', 'Burow R', 'Stinson C', 'Hallahan AR', 'Moore AS']","['UQ Child Health Research Centre, School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'UQ Child Health Research Centre, School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'UQ Child Health Research Centre, School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'UQ Child Health Research Centre, School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'UQ Child Health Research Centre, School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'UQ Child Health Research Centre, School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', 'UQ Child Health Research Centre, School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.', ""UQ Child Health Research Centre, School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; Oncology Service, Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service, Brisbane, Australia."", ""UQ Child Health Research Centre, School of Medicine, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; Oncology Service, Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service, Brisbane, Australia.

Amplicon deep-sequencing enables comprehensive biomarker analysis in a multitude of patients per investigation in an acceptable turn-around time and at affordable costs. Comprehensive myeloid marker panels were successfully introduced into diagnostic practice.

They are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, subsequent cytopenias, transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and poor overall survival. There are currently three FDA-approved medications for MDS; lenalidomide, azacitidine, and decitabine. The role of these agents is to diminish the clinical impact of MDS and delay its progression to AML. However, despite known results with these monotherapies, recent clinical trials with a variety of combinations for MDS have demonstrated promising results. These trials include combinations of hypomethylating agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors, growth factors, and chemotherapy among others. In this paper we review the current literature on combination therapies in MDS, analyze on-going and concluded trials, and suggest future possibilities for combination strategies in MDS.","['Ornstein, Moshe C', 'Mukherjee, Sudipto', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Ornstein MC', 'Mukherjee S', 'Sekeres MA']","['Leukemia Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute, 9500 Euclid Avenue, NA10, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.

The clinical heterogeneity of MDS has led several groups to analyze patient and clinical characteristics to develop prognostic scoring systems yielding estimates of overall and leukaemia-free survival to guide clinical decision-making. These models have evolved over time as our understanding of the pathogenesis, natural history, and treatment of MDS has improved. Rapid advances in flow cytometric analysis, adjuncts to standard metaphase cytogenetics, and gene mutation analysis are revolutionizing our understanding of MDS pathogenesis and prognosis.

Results of morphological characterization showed that PEP-treated cells displayed typical morphological characteristics of apoptosis such as condensation of chromatin and formation of apoptotic bodies. Flow cytometry analyses and colorimetric assay demonstrated that PEP induced collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-9, which indicated that intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway was involved in apoptosis induced by PEP in K562 cells. Western blot analysis showed that PEP increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. In addition, calcium signal might contribute to the cytotoxicity of PEP against K562 cells.

Pharmacokinetic treatment with targeted intravenous busulfan combined with fludarabine (BuFlu) was developed as a preparative regimen for acute leukemia and myelodysplasia. Data from this regimen in lymphoid malignancies are limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed outcomes in 60 consecutive patients with various subtypes of NHL and a median age of 54 years (range, 27-68 years) who received allo-HCT with targeted intravenous BuFlu between December 2004 and August 2010. The median number of previous therapies was 3 (range, 1-8) and median time from diagnosis to HCT was 32 months (range, 4.5-177.5 months). RESULTS: At conditioning, 28 (47%) patients had a complete response (CR). Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus plus methotrexate in 65% of cases. Donors were matched/related (n = 32 [53%]), matched/unrelated (n = 21 [35%]), or mismatched/unrelated (n = 7 [12%]). All patients underwent grafting. The cumulative incidence of grade II/IV acute GVHD was 74% (grade III/IV was 20%). The 2-year cumulative incidence of moderate to severe chronic GVHD was 62%. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days and 3 years was 10% and 25%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse was 27%. Three-year progression-free and overall survival for all patients was 47.8% and 55%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Targeted intravenous BuFlu is a relatively well tolerated regimen and offers an alternative option when myeloablation is deemed necessary in patients with NHL.","['Ayala, Ernesto', 'Figueroa, Javier', 'Perkins, Janelle', 'Kim, Jongphil', 'Yue, Binglin', 'Riches, Marcie', 'Nishihori, Taiga', 'Locke, Frederick', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A']","['Ayala E', 'Figueroa J', 'Perkins J', 'Kim J', 'Yue B', 'Riches M', 'Nishihori T', 'Locke F', 'Anasetti C', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL; Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, FL.

Our recent studies have demonstrated that CD22DeltaE12 is a characteristic genetic defect of therapy-refractory clones in paediatric BPL and implicated the CD22DeltaE12 genetic defect in the aggressive biology of relapsed or therapy-refractory paediatric BPL. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the biological significance of the CD22DeltaE12 molecular lesion in BPL and determine if it could serve as a molecular target for RNA interference (RNAi) therapy. Here we report a previously unrecognized causal link between CD22DeltaE12 and aggressive biology of human BPL cells by demonstrating that siRNA-mediated knockdown of CD22DeltaE12 in primary leukaemic B-cell precursors is associated with a marked inhibition of their clonogenicity. Additionally, we report a nanoscale liposomal formulation of CD22DeltaE12-specific siRNA with potent in vitro and in vivo anti-leukaemic activity against primary human BPL cells as a first-in-class RNAi therapeutic candidate targeting CD22DeltaE12.","['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Ma, Hong', 'Cheng, Jianjun', 'Myers, Dorothea E', 'Qazi, Sanjive']","['Uckun FM', 'Ma H', 'Cheng J', 'Myers DE', 'Qazi S']","[""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), Los Angeles, CA, USA; Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine (USC KSOM), Los Angeles, CA, USA; Translational and Clinical Sciences Program, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine (USC KSOM), Los Angeles, CA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['CA-151837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1DP2OD007246-01/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA-154471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA154471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 OD007246/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA151837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150206,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/therapy', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage/*genetics', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4486322,['NIHMS700499'],2015/02/11 06:00,2015/07/03 06:00,['2015/02/10 06:00'],"['2014/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13306 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 May;169(3):401-14. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13306.

Inherited deficiency of ATM, a regulator of the cellular DNA damage response, predisposes young humans and mice to T-ALLs with clonal chromosome translocations. While acquired ATM mutation or deletion occurs in pediatric T-ALLs, the role of somatic ATM alterations in T-ALL pathogenesis remains unknown. We demonstrate here that somatic Atm inactivation in haematopoietic cells starting as these cells differentiate in utero predisposes mice to T-ALL at similar young ages and harboring analogous translocations as germline Atm-deficient mice. However, some T-ALLs from haematopoietic cell specific deletion of Atm were of more mature thymocytes, revealing that the developmental timing and celluar origin of Atm inactivation influences the phenotype of ATM-deficient T-ALLs. Although it has been hypothesized that ATM suppresses cancer by preventing deletion and inactivation of TP53, we find that Atm inhibits T-ALL independent of Tp53 deletion. Finally, we demonstrate that the Cyclin D3 protein that drives immature T cell proliferation is essential for transformation of Atm-deficient thymocytes. Our study establishes a pre-clinical model for pediatric T-ALLs with acquired ATM inactivation and identifies the cell cycle machinery as a therapeutic target for this aggressive childhood T-ALL subtype.","['Ehrlich, Lori A', 'Yang-Iott, Katherine', 'DeMicco, Amy', 'Bassing, Craig H']","['Ehrlich LA', 'Yang-Iott K', 'DeMicco A', 'Bassing CH']","[""a Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics ; Children's Hospital of Philadelphia ; Philadelphia , PA USA.""]",['eng'],"['5T32CA009615-22/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07229/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA136470/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA177092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA125195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/pathology', 'Cyclin D3/*metabolism', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genomic Instability', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Heterozygote', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Thymocytes/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",PMC4614830,,2015/02/07 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/07 06:00'],"['2015/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384101.2014.988020 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2015;14(3):388-98. doi: 10.4161/15384101.2014.988020.,"['0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)']",['NOTNLM'],"['ATM', 'Cyclin D3', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'translocations', 'tumor suppression']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

DAXX becomes phosphorylated upon DNA damage, however regulation of this modification, and its relationship to p53 remain unclear. Here we show that in human cells exposed to ionizing radiation or genotoxic drugs etoposide and neocarzinostatin, DAXX became rapidly phosphorylated in an ATM kinase-dependent manner. Our deletion and site-directed mutagenesis experiments identified Serine 564 (S564) as the dominant ATM-targeted site of DAXX, and immunofluorescence experiments revealed localization of S564-phosphorylated DAXX to PML nuclear bodies. Furthermore, using a panel of human cell types, we identified the p53-regulated Wip1 protein phosphatase as a key negative regulator of DAXX phosphorylation at S564, both in vitro and in cells. Consistent with the emerging oncogenic role of Wip1, its DAXX-dephosphorylating impact was most apparent in cancer cell lines harboring gain-of-function mutant and/or overexpressed Wip1. Unexpectedly, while Wip1 depletion increased DAXX phosphorylation both before and after DNA damage and increased p53 stability and transcriptional activity, knock-down of DAXX impacted neither p53 stabilization nor p53-mediated expression of Gadd45a, Noxa, Mdm2, p21, Puma, Sesn2, Tigar or Wip1. Consistently, analyses of cells with genetic, TALEN-mediated DAXX deletion corroborated the notion that neither phosphorylated nor non-phosphorylated DAXX is required for p53-mediated gene expression upon DNA damage. Overall, we identify ATM kinase and Wip1 phosphatase as opposing regulators of DAXX-S564 phosphorylation, and propose that the role of DAXX phosphorylation and DAXX itself are independent of p53-mediated gene expression.","['Brazina, Jan', 'Svadlenka, Jan', 'Macurek, Libor', 'Andera, Ladislav', 'Hodny, Zdenek', 'Bartek, Jiri', 'Hanzlikova, Hana']","['Brazina J', 'Svadlenka J', 'Macurek L', 'Andera L', 'Hodny Z', 'Bartek J', 'Hanzlikova H']",['a Department of Cell Signaling and Apoptosis.'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', '*DNA Damage', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2C', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC4353233,,2015/02/07 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/07 06:00'],"['2015/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/15384101.2014.988019 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2015;14(3):375-87. doi: 10.4161/15384101.2014.988019.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPM1D protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2C)']",['NOTNLM'],"['ATM', 'ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; CHX, cycloheximide; DAXX, Death', 'domain-associated protein 6; IR, ionizing radiation; NCS, neocarzinostatin; p21,', 'p21WAF1/Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1; PML, promyelocytic leukemia', 'protein; VP16, etoposide; Wi', 'DAXX', 'DNA damage', 'Wip1', 'p53']",,['Cell Cycle. 2015;14(3):295-6.

We found that dimethylaminomicheliolide (DMAMCL), a selective inhibitor of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) stem/progenitor cells, inhibited the growth of glioma cells. METHODS: The distribution of DMAMCL in brain was analyzed by an ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) system. The anti-tumor evaluations of DMAMCL in vitro were performed by MTT, FACS and RT-PCR. In vivo, the mixture of C6 cells and matrigel was injected into caudatum, and the anti-tumor activity of DMAMCL was evaluated by tumor growth and rat survival. The toxicity of DMAMCL was evaluated by body weight, daily food intake, hematological or serum biochemical analyses, and histological appearance of tissues. RESULTS: The IC50 values of DMAMCL against the C6 and U-87MG cell lines in vitro were 27.18 +/- 1.89 muM and 20.58 +/- 1.61 muM, respectively. DAMMCL down-regulated the anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-2 and increased apoptosis in C6 and U-87MG cells in a dose-dependent manner. In a C6 rat tumor model, daily administration of DMAMCL for 21 days reduced the burden of C6 tumors by 60% to 88% compared to controls, and more than doubled the mean lifespan of tumor-bearing rats. Distribution analysis showed that the DMAMCL concentration was higher in the brain than in plasma. Evaluations for toxicity revealed that oral administration of DMAMCL at 200 or 300 mg/kg once a day for 21 days did not result in toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that DMAMCL is highly promising for the treatment of glioma.","['An, Yinghong', 'Guo, Wanjun', 'Li, Linna', 'Xu, Chengwang', 'Yang, Dexuan', 'Wang, Shanshan', 'Lu, Yaxin', 'Zhang, Quan', 'Zhai, Jiadai', 'Fan, Hongxia', 'Qiu, Chuanjiang', 'Qi, Jie', 'Chen, Yue', 'Yuan, Shoujun']","['An Y', 'Guo W', 'Li L', 'Xu C', 'Yang D', 'Wang S', 'Lu Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhai J', 'Fan H', 'Qiu C', 'Qi J', 'Chen Y', 'Yuan S']","['Clinical Laboratory Center, Chinese PLA Air Force General Hospital, Haidian, Beijing 100142, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, PR China.', 'College of Pharmacy, The State Key Laboratory of Elemento-Organic Chemistry, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering (Tianjin), and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, PR China.', 'College of Pharmacy, The State Key Laboratory of Elemento-Organic Chemistry, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering (Tianjin), and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, PR China.', 'College of Pharmacy, The State Key Laboratory of Elemento-Organic Chemistry, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering (Tianjin), and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, PR China.', 'College of Pharmacy, The State Key Laboratory of Elemento-Organic Chemistry, Collaborative Innovation Center of Chemical Science and Engineering (Tianjin), and Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Drug Research, Nankai University, Tianjin 300071, PR China.', 'Accendatech Co., Ltd., Tianjin 300384, PR China.', 'Accendatech Co., Ltd., Tianjin 300384, PR China.', 'Accendatech Co., Ltd., Tianjin 300384, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 100850, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150206,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glioma/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Molecular Structure', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sesquiterpenes, Guaiane/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles']",PMC4320118,,2015/02/07 06:00,2016/01/16 06:00,['2015/02/07 06:00'],"['2014/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0116202 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-07699 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Feb 6;10(2):e0116202. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0116202. eCollection 2015.,"['0 (Sesquiterpenes, Guaiane)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (dimethylaminomicheliolide)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It exerts immunomodulatory effects that allow HCMV to evade host defense mechanisms. However, the exact mechanism underlying the regulation of hcmvIL-10 expression is not well understood. The transcription factor acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML-1) plays an important role in the regulation of various genes involved in the differentiation of hematopoietic lineages. A putative AML-1 binding site is present within the upstream regulatory region (URR) of UL111A gene. To provide evidence that AML-1 is involved in regulating UL111A gene expression, we examined the interaction of AML-1 with the URR of UL111A in HCMV-infected human monocytic THP-1 cells using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. HcmvIL-10 transcription was detected in differentiated THP-1 cells, but not in undifferentiated ones. Furthermore, the URR of UL111A showed a higher intensity of AML-1 binding, a higher level of histone H3 acetyl-K9, but a lower level of histone H3 dimethyl-K9 in differentiated THP-1 cells than undifferentiated cells. Down-regulation of AML1 by RNA interference decreased the expression of the UL111A gene. Our results suggest that AML-1 may contribute to the epigenetic regulation of UL111A gene via histone modification in HCMV-infected differentiated THP-1 cells.

The objective of this study was to describe an outbreak of invasive fusariosis in a children's cancer hospital. A neutropenic 17-year-old male patient hospitalized for 10 days for a relapse of acute myeloid leukaemia, under chemotherapy, presented fever without any other symptoms; a thoracic computerized tomography showed bilateral pulmonary nodules. During voriconazole treatment, 1-cm reddened and painful subcutaneous nodules appeared on arms and legs and the culture of a skin biopsy revealed F. solani. Another case occurred 11 days later and started an outbreak investigation. Water samples for cultures were collected from taps, showers and water reservoirs. Air from all patient rooms was sampled. Faucets and the drains of sinks and showers were swabbed and cultured. Environmental and clinical isolates were typed. There were 10 confirmed cases of infection caused by Fusarium spp. F. oxysporum and F. solani were isolated from water, swabs and air in patient rooms. Many control measures were instituted, but the outbreak was only controlled 1 year after the first case, when water filters filtering 0.2 mum were installed at the exit of all faucets and showers in all patient rooms (points-of-use). Typing demonstrated that clinical isolates of F. oxysporum were similar to those of the environment. In conclusion, to our knowledge this is the first reported outbreak of invasive fusariosis in children with oncohaematologic disease. It was controlled using 0.2-mum filters in all tap faucets and showers.","['Litvinov, Nadia', 'da Silva, Mariama Tomaz N', 'van der Heijden, Inneke M', 'Graca, Mariana G', 'Marques de Oliveira, Larissa', 'Fu, Liang', 'Giudice, Mauro', 'Zilda de Aquino, Maria', 'Odone-Filho, Vicente', 'Marques, Heloisa Helena', 'Costa, Silvia F', 'Levin, Anna S']","['Litvinov N', 'da Silva MT', 'van der Heijden IM', 'Graca MG', 'Marques de Oliveira L', 'Fu L', 'Giudice M', 'Zilda de Aquino M', 'Odone-Filho V', 'Marques HH', 'Costa SF', 'Levin AS']","[""Instituto de Tratamento de Cancer Infantil (ITACI), Children's Institute, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Department of Pediatrics, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil."", 'Infection Control Department and LIM -54, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Infection Control Department and LIM -54, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Infection Control Department and LIM -54, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Infection Control Department and LIM -54, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Infection Control Department and LIM -54, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Infection Control Department and LIM -54, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.', ""Instituto de Tratamento de Cancer Infantil (ITACI), Children's Institute, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil."", ""Instituto de Tratamento de Cancer Infantil (ITACI), Children's Institute, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Department of Pediatrics, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Infection Control Department and LIM -54, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Infection Control Department and LIM -54, Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Department of Infectious Diseases, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

We examined WIP1 mRNA levels across multiple tumor types and found the highest levels in breast cancer, leukemia, medulloblastoma and neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is an exclusively TP53 wild type tumor at diagnosis and inhibition of p53 is required for tumorigenesis. Neuroblastomas in particular have previously been shown to have 17q amplification, harboring the WIP1 (PPM1D) gene and associated with poor clinical outcome. We therefore sought to determine whether inhibiting WIP1 with a selective antagonist, GSK2830371, can attenuate neuroblastoma cell growth through reactivation of p53 mediated tumor suppression. Neuroblastoma cell lines with wild-type TP53 alleles were highly sensitive to GSK2830371 treatment, while cell lines with mutant TP53 were resistant to GSK2830371. The majority of tested neuroblastoma cell lines with copy number gains of the PPM1D locus were also TP53 wild-type and sensitive to GSK2830371A; in contrast cell lines with no copy gain of PPM1D were mixed in their sensitivity to WIP1 inhibition, with the primary determinant being TP53 mutational status. Since WIP1 is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage and drugs used in neuroblastoma treatment induce apoptosis through DNA damage, we sought to determine whether GSK2830371 could act synergistically with standard of care chemotherapeutics. Treatment of wild-type TP53 neuroblastoma cell lines with both GSK2830371 and either doxorubicin or carboplatin resulted in enhanced cell death, mediated through caspase 3/7 induction, as compared to either agent alone. Our data suggests that WIP1 inhibition represents a novel therapeutic approach to neuroblastoma that could be integrated with current chemotherapeutic approaches.","['Richter, Mark', 'Dayaram, Tajhal', 'Gilmartin, Aidan G', 'Ganji, Gopinath', 'Pemmasani, Sandhya Kiran', 'Van Der Key, Harjeet', 'Shohet, Jason M', 'Donehower, Lawrence A', 'Kumar, Rakesh']","['Richter M', 'Dayaram T', 'Gilmartin AG', 'Ganji G', 'Pemmasani SK', 'Van Der Key H', 'Shohet JM', 'Donehower LA', 'Kumar R']","['Oncology R&D, GlaxoSmithKline, 1250 S.

OBJECTIVE: To study leading cancer incidents and mortality and their age distribution in both sexes in Gandhinagar district. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary data were collected from various sources and entered in computer and analyzed. Quality checks were done, and duplicate cases were eliminated. For mortality data, death registration units were contacted. RESULTS: Total 2360 incident cases (1374 males and 986 females) and 736 mortality cases (464 males and 272 females) were recorded during the year 2009-2011 in Gandhinagar district. Among males, the leadings sites were mouth, tongue, lung, esophagus, hypopharynx, and larynx, whereas in females they were breast, cervix, ovary, mouth, tongue and myeloid leukemia. Majority of cases were found in the age group of 35-64 years and the proportion in male and female in this age group was 62.51% and 71.05%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study helps to understand the possible cancer patterns in Gandhinagar district. Foremost causes of cancer in leading sites in males were tobacco related, and the proportion of cancers associated with tobacco was 53% in our study. It highlights the possibility of easy and early detection of cancers, especially by oral cancer screening in the population. Further, the findings highlight the need of cancer cervix and breast screening among the women at regular intervals through camp approach in the community, as these are the most common sites (40% of female cancers).","['Jivarajani, Parimal J', 'Patel, Himanshu V', 'Mecwan, Rupal R', 'Solanki, Jayesh B', 'Pandya, Vishruti B']","['Jivarajani PJ', 'Patel HV', 'Mecwan RR', 'Solanki JB', 'Pandya VB']","['Department of Community Oncology and Medical Records, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.', 'Department of Community Oncology and Medical Records, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.', 'Department of Community Oncology and Medical Records, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.', 'Department of Community Oncology and Medical Records, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.', 'Department of Community Oncology and Medical Records, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Community Med,Indian journal of community medicine : official publication of Indian Association of Preventive & Social Medicine,9315574,,,PMC4317983,,2015/02/07 06:00,2015/02/07 06:01,['2015/02/07 06:00'],"['2014/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0970-0218.149273 [doi]', 'IJCM-40-56 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Community Med. 2015 Jan-Mar;40(1):56-61. doi: 10.4103/0970-0218.149273.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mortality/incidence% (M/I%) ratio', 'Population based cancer registry', 'age', 'gender', 'incidence', 'mortality']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

India is considered as a nonendemic region for HTLV-1. Recent upsurge of cases have been noted in southern parts of India. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The objective was to describe skin manifestations in various types of ATL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical examination, blood investigations, skin biopsies, lymph node biopsies, and immunohistochemistry were performed in five patients. Flow cytometry was performed in two cases. RESULTS: Serological testing was positive for HTLV-1 in all patients. All patients presented with skin lesions. Rare presentations of molluscum contagiosum like papules, purpuric macules and plaques, hypopigmented macules and verrucous papules were seen. Dermatophytic infections occurred in two patients. Mucosal lesion was seen in one patient. Histological features include dermal lymphoid infiltrate with or without epidermotropism. Presence of epidermotropism did not correlate with the severity of disease. All patients except one succumbed to illness within few months to 1 year period. CONCLUSIONS: ATL manifest in myriad presentations and skin lesions are often the earliest manifestation. Cutaneous manifestations of ATL vary from subtle hypopigmented macules to florid nodular lesions, and HTLV-1 screening need to be carried out in all doubtful cases.","['Khader, Anza', 'Shaan, Mohamed', 'Balakrishnan, Sunitha', 'Ambooken, Betsy', 'Muhammed, Kunnummel', 'Rajan, Uma']","['Khader A', 'Shaan M', 'Balakrishnan S', 'Ambooken B', 'Muhammed K', 'Rajan U']","['Department of Dermatology, Government Medical College, Calicut, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Medicine, Government Medical College, Calicut, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Government Medical College, Calicut, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Dermatology, Government Medical College, Calicut, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Dermatology, Government Medical College, Calicut, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Dermatology, Government Medical College, Calicut, Kerala, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Dermatol,Indian journal of dermatology,0370750,,,PMC4318027,,2015/02/07 06:00,2015/02/07 06:01,['2015/02/07 06:00'],"['2015/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0019-5154.147846 [doi]', 'IJD-60-103c [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Dermatol. 2015 Jan-Feb;60(1):103. doi: 10.4103/0019-5154.147846.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'India', 'skin lesions']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF released from inflammatory cells can then stimulate gene expression in tissue cells, such as fibroblasts. To determine whether TTP could affect the decay of TNF-induced transcripts in fibroblasts, we exposed primary embryonic fibroblasts and stable fibroblast cell lines, derived from WT and TTP KO mice, to TNF. The decay rates of transcripts encoded by several early-response genes, including Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Ier3, Ptgs2, and Lif, were significantly slowed in TTP-deficient fibroblasts after TNF stimulation. These changes were associated with TTP-dependent increases in CXCL1, CXCL2, and IER3 protein levels. The TTP-susceptible transcripts contained multiple, conserved, closely spaced, potential TTP binding sites in their 3'-UTRs. WT TTP, but not a nonbinding TTP zinc finger mutant, bound to RNA probes that were based on the mRNA sequences of Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Ptgs2, and Lif. TTP-promoted decay of transcripts encoding chemokines and other proinflammatory mediators is thus a critical post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism in the response of secondary cells, such as fibroblasts, to TNF released from primary immune cells.","['Qiu, Lian-Qun', 'Lai, Wi S', 'Bradbury, Alyce', 'Zeldin, Darryl C', 'Blackshear, Perry J']","['Qiu LQ', 'Lai WS', 'Bradbury A', 'Zeldin DC', 'Blackshear PJ']","['*Laboratories of Signal Transduction and Respiratory Biology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA; and Departments of Medicine and Biochemistry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', '*Laboratories of Signal Transduction and Respiratory Biology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA; and Departments of Medicine and Biochemistry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', '*Laboratories of Signal Transduction and Respiratory Biology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA; and Departments of Medicine and Biochemistry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', '*Laboratories of Signal Transduction and Respiratory Biology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA; and Departments of Medicine and Biochemistry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', '*Laboratories of Signal Transduction and Respiratory Biology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA; and Departments of Medicine and Biochemistry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA black009@niehs.nih.gov.']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20150205,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'AU Rich Elements', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Chemokine CXCL2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/physiology', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Inflammation/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'RNA Stability/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptors/agonists', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tristetraprolin/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",PMC4370050,,2015/02/07 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2015/02/07 06:00'],"['2015/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.3A0214-106R [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.3A0214-106R [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2015 Apr;97(4):723-36. doi: 10.1189/jlb.3A0214-106R.

Prognosis is poor with standard chemoimmunotherapy. Since 2003, the British Columbia Cancer Agency has used CODOX-M/IVAC+R (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, methotrexate, cytarabine, ifosfamide, and etoposide, combined with rituximab) followed by consolidative hematopoietic cell transplantation as definitive treatment for double-hit lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the survival outcomes of patients with double-hit lymphoma treated at our institution was conducted. Thirty-two patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma with concurrent MYC and BCL2 translocations from 2003 to 2013 were identified. Cases with MYC or BCL2 amplification and those with overexpression in immunohistochemistry analysis were excluded. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 53.0 years (range, 35.5-70.9 years), 23 (72%) were male, and 30 (94%) had stage III to IV disease. CODOX-M/IVAC+R was administered in 25 (78%) patients and 20 (80%) achieved a partial remission or better, of which 9 (36%) had a complete remission. Nineteen of the 32 (59%) patients underwent upfront hematopoietic cell transplantation. At a median follow-up of living patients of 26.4 months, 14 (44%) were alive in remission, 15 (47%) died, and 3 (9%) were alive in relapse. The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of all patients were 41% and 53%, respectively. The sixteen patients treated with CODOX-M/IVAC+R followed by hematopoietic cell transplantation had a 2-year PFS of 60% and 2-year OS of 82%. CONCLUSION: Patients with double-hit lymphoma treated with CODOX-M/IVAC+R followed by hematopoietic cell transplantation can achieve durable remissions, although disease progression before transplantation remains a significant problem.","['Sun, Haowei', 'Savage, Kerry J', 'Karsan, Aly', 'Slack, Graham W', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Toze, Cynthia L', 'Sehn, Laurie H', 'Abou Mourad, Yasser', 'Barnett, Michael J', 'Broady, Raewyn C', 'Connors, Joseph M', 'Forrest, Donna L', 'Gerrie, Alina S', 'Hogge, Donna E', 'Narayanan, Sujaatha', 'Nevill, Thomas J', 'Nantel, Stephen H', 'Power, Maryse M', 'Sutherland, Heather J', 'Villa, Diego', 'Shepherd, John D', 'Song, Kevin W']","['Sun H', 'Savage KJ', 'Karsan A', 'Slack GW', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Toze CL', 'Sehn LH', 'Abou Mourad Y', 'Barnett MJ', 'Broady RC', 'Connors JM', 'Forrest DL', 'Gerrie AS', 'Hogge DE', 'Narayanan S', 'Nevill TJ', 'Nantel SH', 'Power MM', 'Sutherland HJ', 'Villa D', 'Shepherd JD', 'Song KW']","['Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer and Department of Medical Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Genome Sciences Centre and Department of Pathology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer and Department of Pathology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer and Department of Pathology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer and Department of Medical Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer and Department of Medical Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Centre for Lymphoid Cancer and Department of Medical Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada; Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer and Department of Medical Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, Canada.

In this paper, we address the problem of how to include studies with zero events in inverse variance meta-analyses when individual patient data are not available, going beyond the naive approach of not including the study or the use of a continuity correction. The proposed solution is the arcsine transformation of the crude cumulative incidence as its approximate variance, which is inversely proportional to the sample size, can be calculated also for studies with a zero estimate. As an alternative, generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) can be used. Simulations were performed to compare the results from inverse variance method meta-analyses of the arcsine transformed cumulative incidence to those obtained from meta-analyses of the cumulative incidence itself and of the logit transformation of the cumulative incidence. The comparisons have been carried out for different scenarios of heterogeneity, incidence, and censoring and for competing and not competing risks. The arcsine transformation showed the smallest bias and the highest coverage among models assuming within study normality. At the same time, the GLMM model had the best performance at very low incidences. The proposed method was applied to the clinical context that motivated this work, i.e. a meta-analysis of 5-year crude cumulative incidence of central nervous system recurrences in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Andreano, Anita', 'Rebora, Paola', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia']","['Andreano A', 'Rebora P', 'Valsecchi MG']","['Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan-Bicocca, Via Cadore 48, 20900, Monza, Italy.', 'Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan-Bicocca, Via Cadore 48, 20900, Monza, Italy.', 'Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan-Bicocca, Via Cadore 48, 20900, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150205,Germany,Biom J,Biometrical journal.

Indeed, various reports have indicated associations between cN-II expression level and resistance to anticancer agents in several cancer cell lines and in patients affected with neoplasia, mainly by hematologic malignancies. In this paper we present evidence showing that, among the commonly used cytotoxic nucleoside analogs, fludarabine can act as a cN-II inhibitor. In vitro studies using the wild type recombinant cN-II demonstrated that fludarabine inhibited enzymatic activity in a mixed manner (Ki 0.5 mM and Ki' 9 mM), whereas no inhibition was observed with clofarabine and cladribine. Additional experiments with mutant recombinant proteins and an in silico molecular docking indicated that this inhibition is due to an interaction with a regulatory site of cN-II known to interact with adenylic compounds. Moreover, synergy experiments between fludarabine and 6-mercaptopurine in human follicular lymphoma (RL) and human acute promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells transfected with control or cN-II-targeting shRNA-encoding plasmids, showed synergy in control cells and antagonism in cells with decreased cN-II expression. This is in line with the hypothesis that fludarabine acts as a cN-II inhibitor and supports the idea of using cN-II inhibitors in association with other drugs to increase their therapeutic effect and decrease their resistance.","['Cividini, F', 'Pesi, R', 'Chaloin, L', 'Allegrini, S', 'Camici, M', 'Cros-Perrial, E', 'Dumontet, C', 'Jordheim, L P', 'Tozzi, M G']","['Cividini F', 'Pesi R', 'Chaloin L', 'Allegrini S', 'Camici M', 'Cros-Perrial E', 'Dumontet C', 'Jordheim LP', 'Tozzi MG']","['University of Pisa, Department of Biology, Biochemistry Unit, Pisa, Italy.

To date, imatinib represents the frontline treatment for CML therapy. The development of resistance has prompted the search for novel Bcr-Abl inhibitors. AREAS COVERED: This review presents a short overview of drugs already approved for CML therapy and of the compounds that are in clinical trials. The body of the article deals with Bcr-Abl inhibitors patented since 2008, focusing on their chemical features. EXPERT OPINION: The search for Bcr-Abl inhibitors is very active. We believe that a number of patented compounds could enter clinical trials and some could be approved for CML therapy in the next few years. Overall, Bcr-Abl inhibitors constitute a very appealing research field that can be expected to expand further.","['Desogus, Andrea', 'Schenone, Silvia', 'Brullo, Chiara', 'Tintori, Cristina', 'Musumeci, Francesca']","['Desogus A', 'Schenone S', 'Brullo C', 'Tintori C', 'Musumeci F']","['Universita degli Studi di Genova, Dipartimento di Farmacia , Viale Benedetto XV 3, I-16132, Genova , Italy +0039 010 3538362 ; schensil@unige.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150206,England,Expert Opin Ther Pat,Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,9516419,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Patents as Topic', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",,,2015/02/07 06:00,2016/05/18 06:00,['2015/02/07 06:00'],"['2015/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543776.2015.1012155 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Pat. 2015 Apr;25(4):397-412. doi: 10.1517/13543776.2015.1012155.

The interval between cancer diagnosis and NCT onset and the prognosis after pericardiocentesis may differ according to cancer type. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective study of 113 patients (54 % male) with NCT who underwent pericardiocentesis at Niigata Cancer Center Hospital between 1992 and 2013. Mean age at NCT was 61.2 years (range 15.9-94.8 years). The most common underlying cancers were lung cancer (59.2 %), breast cancer (21.2 %), lymphoma/leukemia (5.3 %), and gastric/esophageal cancer (5.3 %). The median time from cancer diagnosis to NCT onset was 9.0, 60.4, 5.6, and 8.0 months for lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma/leukemia, and gastric/esophageal cancer, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were worse for breast cancer patients with NCT than for matched breast cancer patients without NCT (P < 0.0001). Median survival time after pericardiocentesis was 2.9, 4.2, 2.3, and 0.6 months for lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma/leukemia, and gastric/esophageal cancer, respectively; one-year survival after pericardiocentesis was 6.0, 16.7, 33.3, and 0 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The interval between cancer diagnosis and NCT onset, the impact of NCT on prognosis, and the prognosis after pericardiocentesis differed according to cancer type. Healthcare practitioners caring for patients with NCT should recognize the differences between cancer types and customize their care accordingly.","['Takayama, Tsugumi', 'Okura, Yuji', 'Okada, Yoshinobu', 'Honma, Keiichi', 'Nashimoto, Atsushi', 'Sato, Nobuaki', 'Yokoyama, Akira', 'Minamino, Tohru']","['Takayama T', 'Okura Y', 'Okada Y', 'Honma K', 'Nashimoto A', 'Sato N', 'Yokoyama A', 'Minamino T']","['Department of Cardiology, Niigata Cancer Center Hospital, Chu-o-ku Kawagishicho 2-15-3, Niigata, 951-8560, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiology, Niigata Cancer Center Hospital, Chu-o-ku Kawagishicho 2-15-3, Niigata, 951-8560, Japan. okuray@niigata-cc.jp.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kamo Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Niigata Cancer Center Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Digestive Surgery, Niigata Cancer Center Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, Niigata Cancer Center Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Niigata Cancer Center Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Biology and Medicine, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150206,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cardiac Tamponade/etiology/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', '*Pericardiocentesis', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2015/02/07 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/02/07 06:00'],"['2014/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10147-015-0794-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s10147-015-0794-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2015 Oct;20(5):872-7. doi: 10.1007/s10147-015-0794-7.

Twenty-nine studies published in the years 1996-2012 (including 44 cost-effectiveness ratios) met inclusion criteria, 22 (76%) of which were industry funded. Most ratios fell below $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) (73%) and $100,000/QALY (86%). Industry-funded studies (n = 22) reported a lower median ratio ($26,000/QALY) than others (n = 7; $33,000/QALY), although the difference was not statistically significant.

Co-expression based analyses uncovered a system-wide, ladder-like transcription factor cluster structure composed of nearly 1,600 transcription factors in a human transcriptional network. Computer simulations based on a transcriptional regulatory model deduced from the system-wide, ladder-like transcription factor cluster structure reproduced expression pattern transitions when human THP-1 myelomonocytic leukaemia cells cease proliferation and differentiate under phorbol myristate acetate stimulation. The behaviour of MYC, a reprogramming Yamanaka factor that was suggested to be essential for induced pluripotent stem cells during dedifferentiation, could be interpreted based on the transcriptional regulation predicted by the system-wide, ladder-like transcription factor cluster structure. This study introduces a novel system-wide structure to transcriptional networks that provides new insights into network topology.","['Sakata, Katsumi', 'Ohyanagi, Hajime', 'Sato, Shinji', 'Nobori, Hiroya', 'Hayashi, Akiko', 'Ishii, Hideshi', 'Daub, Carsten O', 'Kawai, Jun', 'Suzuki, Harukazu', 'Saito, Toshiyuki']","['Sakata K', 'Ohyanagi H', 'Sato S', 'Nobori H', 'Hayashi A', 'Ishii H', 'Daub CO', 'Kawai J', 'Suzuki H', 'Saito T']","['1] National Institute of Radiological Sciences, 4-9-1 Anagawa, Inage-ku, Chiba-city, Chiba 263-8555, Japan [2] Maebashi Institute of Technology, 460-1 Kamisadori-machi, Maebashi-city, Gunma 371-0816, Japan.', '1] National Institute of Radiological Sciences, 4-9-1 Anagawa, Inage-ku, Chiba-city, Chiba 263-8555, Japan [2] Maebashi Institute of Technology, 460-1 Kamisadori-machi, Maebashi-city, Gunma 371-0816, Japan [3] Mitsubishi Space Software Co., Ltd., Tsukuba-Mitsui Building, 1-6-1 Takezono, Tsukuba-city, Ibaraki 305-0032, Japan [4] National Institute of Genetics, 1111 Yata, Mishima-city, Shizuoka 411-8540, Japan.', 'Maze Inc., 1-2-17 M604, Sennin-machi, Hachioji-city, Tokyo 193-0835, Japan.', 'Mitsubishi Space Software Co., Ltd., Tsukuba-Mitsui Building, 1-6-1 Takezono, Tsukuba-city, Ibaraki 305-0032, Japan.', 'National Institute of Radiological Sciences, 4-9-1 Anagawa, Inage-ku, Chiba-city, Chiba 263-8555, Japan.', '1] National Institute of Radiological Sciences, 4-9-1 Anagawa, Inage-ku, Chiba-city, Chiba 263-8555, Japan [2] Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita-city, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.', '1] RIKEN Omics Science Center, 1-7-22 Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama-city, Kanagawa, 230-0045, Japan [2] RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies, Division of Genomic Technologies, 1-7-22 Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama-city, Kanagawa, 230-0045, Japan [3] Department of Biosciences and Nutrition and Science for Life Laboratory, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, SE-141 86, Sweden.', '1] RIKEN Omics Science Center, 1-7-22 Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama-city, Kanagawa, 230-0045, Japan [2] RIKEN Preventive Medicine and Diagnosis Innovative Program, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan.', '1] RIKEN Omics Science Center, 1-7-22 Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama-city, Kanagawa, 230-0045, Japan [2] RIKEN Center for Life Science Technologies, Division of Genomic Technologies, 1-7-22 Suehiro-cho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama-city, Kanagawa, 230-0045, Japan.', 'National Institute of Radiological Sciences, 4-9-1 Anagawa, Inage-ku, Chiba-city, Chiba 263-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150206,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', '*Models, Biological', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC4319166,,2015/02/07 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/07 06:00'],"['2014/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['srep08283 [pii]', '10.1038/srep08283 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Feb 6;5:8283. doi: 10.1038/srep08283.,['0 (Phorbol Esters)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age at SCT 3 was 44 years (range 20-58 years). The patients had de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 4), secondary AML following myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 2), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 1). Four patients received myeloablative conditioning, and three received reduced-intensity conditioning. All but one patient had myeloid reconstitution with remission, but five patients relapsed even after SCT3. However, one patient is alive and disease-free 6 years after SCT3, which is the longest remission duration among three allogeneic SCTs she received. Furthermore, actual survival after relapse of SCT 2 was significantly better for patients who received SCT3 compared with institutional control patients who never received SCT3 (P < 0.001). These results suggest that the use of CB may allow the opportunity to perform SCT3 in patients who have experienced relapsed leukemia without donors, and SCT3 with CB may offer the chance of durable remission for selected patients with relapsed acute leukemia.","['Konuma, Takaaki', 'Kato, Seiko', 'Ooi, Jun', 'Ebihara, Yasuhiro', 'Mochizuki, Shinji', 'Oiwa-Monna, Maki', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Takahashi, Satoshi']","['Konuma T', 'Kato S', 'Ooi J', 'Ebihara Y', 'Mochizuki S', 'Oiwa-Monna M', 'Tojo A', 'Takahashi S']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1, Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan, tkonuma@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150206,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adult', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/complications/*therapy', '*Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/02/07 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2015/02/07 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-015-1755-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Apr;101(4):392-7. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1755-7.

Gp85 protein is the main envelope protein and the most variable structural protein of ALV-J. It is also involved in virus neutralization. In this study, a specific monoclonal antibody, 4A3, was produced against the ALV-J gp85 protein. Immunofluorescence assays showed that 4A3 could react with different strains of ALV-J, including the British prototype isolate HPRS103, the American strains, an early Chinese broiler isolate, and layer isolates. A linear epitope on the gp85 protein was identified using a series of partially overlapping fragments spanning the gp85-encoding gene and subjecting them to western blot analysis. The results indicated that (134)AEAELRDFI(142) was the minimal linear epitope that could be recognized by mAb 4A3. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that chicken anti-ALV-J sera and mouse anti-ALV-J gp85 sera could also recognize the minimal linear epitope. Alignment analysis of amino acid sequences indicated that the epitope was highly conserved among 34 ALV-J strains. Furthermore, the epitope was not conserved among subgroup A and B of avian leukosis virus (ALV). Taken together, the mAb and the identified epitope may provide valuable tools for the development of new diagnostic methods for ALV-J.","['Li, Xiaofei', 'Zhu, Haibo', 'Wang, Qi', 'Sun, Jiashan', 'Gao, Yanni', 'Qi, Xiaole', 'Wang, Yongqiang', 'Gao, Honglei', 'Gao, Yulong', 'Wang, Xiaomei']","['Li X', 'Zhu H', 'Wang Q', 'Sun J', 'Gao Y', 'Qi X', 'Wang Y', 'Gao H', 'Gao Y', 'Wang X']","[""Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, No. 427 Maduan Street, Nan Gang District, Harbin, 150001, Heilongjiang, People's Republic of China, lixiaofei2338@sina.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150206,Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Avian Leukosis/immunology/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/chemistry/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Chickens', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/*chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Poultry Diseases/immunology/*virology', 'Species Specificity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*immunology']",,,2015/02/07 06:00,2015/05/27 06:00,['2015/02/07 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00705-014-2318-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 2015 Apr;160(4):995-1004. doi: 10.1007/s00705-014-2318-6.

To investigate the regulatory interplay between these driver genes, we have used a novel transgenic RNA interference mouse model to produce primary T-ALLs driven by reversible Ikaros knockdown. Restoring endogenous Ikaros expression in established T-ALL in vivo acutely represses Notch1 and its oncogenic target genes including Myc, and in multiple primary leukemias causes disease regression. In contrast, leukemias expressing high levels of endogenous or engineered forms of activated intracellular Notch1 (ICN1) resembling those found in human T-ALL rapidly relapse following Ikaros restoration, indicating that ICN1 functionally antagonizes Ikaros in established disease. Furthermore, we find that IKAROS mRNA expression is significantly reduced in a cohort of primary human T-ALL patient samples with activating NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations, but is upregulated upon acute inhibition of aberrant NOTCH signaling across a panel of human T-ALL cell lines. These results demonstrate for the first time that aberrant NOTCH activity compromises IKAROS function in mouse and human T-ALL, and provide a potential explanation for the relative infrequency of IKAROS gene mutations in human T-ALL.","['Witkowski, M T', 'Cimmino, L', 'Hu, Y', 'Trimarchi, T', 'Tagoh, H', 'McKenzie, M D', 'Best, S A', 'Tuohey, L', 'Willson, T A', 'Nutt, S L', 'Busslinger, M', 'Aifantis, I', 'Smyth, G K', 'Dickins, R A']","['Witkowski MT', 'Cimmino L', 'Hu Y', 'Trimarchi T', 'Tagoh H', 'McKenzie MD', 'Best SA', 'Tuohey L', 'Willson TA', 'Nutt SL', 'Busslinger M', 'Aifantis I', 'Smyth GK', 'Dickins RA']","['1] Molecular Medicine Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] Molecular Medicine Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia [3] Department of Pathology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Bioinformatics Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna Biocenter, Vienna, Austria.', '1] Molecular Medicine Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] Molecular Medicine Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] Molecular Medicine Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] Molecular Medicine Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Molecular Immunology Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna Biocenter, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pathology, NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', '1] Bioinformatics Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] Molecular Medicine Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA173636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA169784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA194923/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '291740/European Research Council/International', 'R01 CA149655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA173636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA133379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA149655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA169784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA105129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150206,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'F-Box Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Flow Cytometry', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4845663,['NIHMS775164'],2015/02/07 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/02/07 06:00'],"['2014/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201527 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.27 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jun;29(6):1301-11. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.27.

Dysregulated MC development leads to systemic mastocytosis (SM), a clinically variable but often devastating family of hematologic disorders. Here we report that induced expression of Lin28, a heterochronic gene and pluripotency factor implicated in driving a fetal hematopoietic program, caused MC accumulation in adult mice in target organs such as the skin and peritoneal cavity. In vitro assays revealed a skewing of myeloid commitment in LIN28B-expressing hematopoietic progenitors, with increased levels of LIN28B in common myeloid and basophil-MC progenitors altering gene expression patterns to favor cell fate choices that enhanced MC specification. In addition, LIN28B-induced MCs appeared phenotypically and functionally immature, and in vitro assays suggested a slowing of MC terminal differentiation in the context of LIN28B upregulation. Finally, interrogation of human MC leukemia samples revealed upregulation of LIN28B in abnormal MCs from patients with SM. This work identifies Lin28 as a novel regulator of innate immune function and a new protein of interest in MC disease.","['Wang, L D', 'Rao, T N', 'Rowe, R G', 'Nguyen, P T', 'Sullivan, J L',

Recently, myelodysplastic syndrome has been observed at low benzene exposure levels. METHODS: We updated a mortality study of workers with benzene exposure examining acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. We calculated standardized mortality ratios with 95% confidence intervals and examined latency and trends for cumulative exposure levels. RESULTS: All leukemias (standardized mortality ratio = 1.21; 95% confidence interval = 0.74 to 1.97) and acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (standardized mortality ratio = 1.04; 95% confidence interval = 0.34 to 2.44) were at expected levels. We observed one death from myelodysplastic syndrome (standardized mortality ratio = 6.48; 95% confidence interval = 0.17 to 38.15). We observed no trend for cumulative exposure levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results for all leukemias are consistent with a small increase in risk observed in the lower-exposed subgroups of the Pliofilm study; however, our results are also consistent with no increased risk especially for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.","['Collins, James J', 'Anteau, Steven E', 'Swaen, Gerard M H', 'Bodner, Kenneth M', 'Bodnar, Catherine M']","['Collins JJ', 'Anteau SE', 'Swaen GM', 'Bodner KM', 'Bodnar CM']","['From the Saginaw Valley State University (Dr Collins), University Center; The Dow Chemical Company (Mr Anteau, Mr Bodner, and Dr Bodnar), Midland, Mich; and Maastricht University (Dr Swaen), the Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Occup Environ Med,Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,9504688,IM,"['Benzene/analysis/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/analysis/*toxicity', 'Cause of Death', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/mortality', 'Michigan/epidemiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,2015/02/06 06:00,2015/11/13 06:00,['2015/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/JOM.0000000000000324 [doi]', '00043764-201502000-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,J Occup Environ Med. 2015 Feb;57(2):159-63. doi: 10.1097/JOM.0000000000000324.,"['0 (Carcinogens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aprepitant is a P/neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist approved for the prevention of CINV in moderate emetic risk chemotherapy. We explored its effectiveness in patients with leukemia receiving cytarabine-based chemotherapy. Methods. Patients were randomized to ondansetron (OND) 8 mg IV 30 minutes before cytarabine followed by 24 mg IV continuous infusion daily until 6-12 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy alone or with aprepitant (APREP) oral 125 mg 6-12 hrs before chemotherapy and 80 mg daily until 1 day after the last dose of chemotherapy. Results. Forty-nine patients were enrolled in each arm; 42 in OND and 41 in OND + APREP arm were evaluable for efficacy. The ORR with OND + APREP was 80% compared to 67% with OND alone (P = 0.11). On days 6 and 7, higher proportion of patients treated with OND + APREP were free from nausea (74%, 74% versus 68%, 67%; P = 0.27 and 0.18, resp.). Requirement of rescue medications on days 2 and 3 was fewer in OND + APREP arm 7% and 5% compared to 21% and 16% in the OND arm, respectively (P = 0.06 and P = 0.07). Conclusions. There was a trend for overall improvement in emesis with ondansetron plus aprepitant. The potential benefit of this approach with specific chemotherapy combinations remains to be determined.","['Badar, Talha', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Borthakur, Gautam', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Wierda, William', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Poku, Rebeca', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Mattiuzzi, Gloria']","['Badar T', 'Cortes J', 'Borthakur G', ""O'Brien S"", 'Wierda W', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Kadia T', 'Poku R', 'Kantarjian H', 'Mattiuzzi G']","['Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000371/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150115,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Aprepitant', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morpholines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Nausea/chemically induced/complications/*prevention & control', 'Ondansetron/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vomiting/chemically induced/complications/*prevention & control']",PMC4310492,,2015/02/06 06:00,2015/10/13 06:00,['2015/02/06 06:00'],"['2014/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/497597 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:497597. doi: 10.1155/2015/497597.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequencies of Micronuclei (MN) and other Nuclear abnormalities (NA) from exfoliated oral mucosal cells in Nuclear Power Station (NPS) workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Micronucleus frequencies in oral exfoliated cells were done from individuals not known to be exposed to either environmental or occupational carcinogens (Group I). Similarly samples were obtained from full-time Nuclear Power Station (NPS) workers with absence of Leukemia and any malignancy (Group II) and workers diagnosed as leukemic patients and undergoing treatment (Group III). RESULTS: There was statistically significant difference between Group I, Group II & Group III. MN and NA frequencies in Leukemic Patients were significantly higher than those in exposed workers &control groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MN and other NA reflect genetic changes, events associated with malignancies. Therefore, there is a need to educate those who work in NPS about the potential hazard of occupational exposure and the importance of using protective measures.","['Sagari, Shitalkumar G', 'Babannavar, Roopa', 'Lohra, Abhishek', 'Kodgi, Ashwin', 'Bapure, Sunil', 'Rao, Yogesh', 'J, Arun', 'Malghan, Manjunath']","['Sagari SG', 'Babannavar R', 'Lohra A', 'Kodgi A', 'Bapure S', 'Rao Y', 'J A', 'Malghan M']","['Senior Lecturer, Department of Oral Pathology & Microbiology, Jodhpur Dental College General Hospital , Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India .', 'Senior Lecturer, Department of Conservative Dentistry & Endodontics, Jodhpur Dental College General Hospital , Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India .', 'Lecturer, Jodhpur School of Public Health, Jodhpur National University , Jodhpur, India .', 'Senior Lecturer, Department of Prosthodontics, MIDSR Dental College and Hospital , Latur, Maharashtra, India .', 'Senior Lecturer, Department of Periodontics, MIDSR Dental College and Hospital , Latur, Maharashtra, India .', 'Senior Lecturer, Department of Prosthodontics, Maharana Pratap Dental College and Research Centre , Gwalior, India .', 'Senior Lecturer, Department of Conservative Dentistry & Endodontics, Bapuji Dental College and Hospital , Davanagere, Karanataka, India .', 'Senior Lecturer, Department of Orthodontics, KLE VK institute of Dental Sciences , Belgaum, Karnataka, India .']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141205,India,J Clin Diagn Res,Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,101488993,,,PMC4316328,,2015/02/06 06:00,2015/02/06 06:01,['2015/02/06 06:00'],"['2014/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7860/JCDR/2014/9059.5240 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Diagn Res. 2014 Dec;8(12):ZC15-7. doi: 10.7860/JCDR/2014/9059.5240.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curable therapy for pediatric cancer. However, changes in cardiac function in children after HSCT are not well known. We assessed left ventricular (LV) function in children after HSCT using speckle tracking echocardiography (STE). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty consecutive patients with median age of 11.9 years (range, 1.5-16 years) who received HSCT for acute leukemia and had comprehensive echocardiography before and after (median 9.2 month) HSCT were included in this study. The LV function parameters including conventional tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and STE data were collected from pre- and post-HSCT echocardiography. These data were compared to those of 39 age-matched normal controls. RESULTS: Compared to normal controls, post HSCT patients had similar (p=0.06) LV ejection fraction. However, the following three LV function parameters were significantly decreased in post HSCT patients: rate-corrected velocity of circumferential fiber shortening (p=0.04), mitral inflow E velocity (p<0.001), and mitral septal annular E' velocity (p=0.03). The following four STE parameters were also significantly decreased in post HSCT patients: LV global circumferential systolic strain (p<0.01), strain rate (SR, p=0.01), circumferential diastolic SR (p<0.01), and longitudinal diastolic SR (p<0.001). There was no significant change in TDI or STE parameters after HSCT compared to pre-HSCT. Patients with anthracycline cumulative dose >400 mg/m(2) showed significantly (p<0.05) lower circumferential systolic strain and circumferential diastolic SR. CONCLUSION: Subclinical cardiac dysfunction is evident in children after HSCT. It might be associated with pre-HSCT anthracycline exposure with little effect of conditioning regimens. Serial monitoring of cardiac function is mandatory for all children following HSCT.","['Yoon, Ji-Hong', 'Kim, Hye Jin', 'Lee, Eun-Jung', 'Moon, Sena', 'Lee, Jae Young', 'Lee, Jae Wook', 'Chung, Nack Gyun', 'Cho, Bin', 'Kim, Hack Ki']","['Yoon JH', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee EJ', 'Moon S', 'Lee JY', 'Lee JW', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B', 'Kim HK']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150126,Korea (South),Korean Circ J,Korean circulation journal,101247141,,,PMC4310980,,2015/02/06 06:00,2015/02/06 06:01,['2015/02/06 06:00'],"['2014/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/16 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4070/kcj.2015.45.1.51 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean Circ J. 2015 Jan;45(1):51-8. doi: 10.4070/kcj.2015.45.1.51.

We report data on 277 t-MN patients, recruited between 1999 and 2013 by the Italian Network on Secondary Leukemias (104 retrospectively and 173 prospectively registered). Median age at t-MN diagnosis was 64 years (range, 21-87). Most frequent primary malignancies (PMs) were lymphoproliferative diseases and breast cancer. One hundred and thirty-three patients had received chemotherapy (CHT), 43 patients radiotherapy (RT), and 101 patients combined CHT/RT for PM. Median time between cytotoxic treatment and t-MN was 5.7 years, with t-MN following RT alone associated with significantly longer latency, compared to CHT or combined CHT/RT (mean, 11.2 vs. 7.1 years, P = 0.0005). The addition of topoisomerase-II inhibitors to alkylating agents was associated with shorter latency compared to alkylating agents alone (median, 6 vs. 8.4 years, P = 0.02). Median survival was 14.6 months from t-MN diagnosis, and was significantly longer in patients treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Significant factors for survival at the multivariable analysis included age, adverse karyotype, and degree of anemia. Our data underline the prognostic importance of karyotype and age in t-MN, similar to de novo acute myeloid leukemia.

Due to the relatively recent availability of this material in well dispersed nanometric form, its biocompatibility was not known to date. In this study, we present a thorough assessment of the effects of in vitro exposure of human adenocarcinoma (A549), lung squamous carcinoma (NCI-H520), and acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cell lines to uncoated and poly(ethylene glycol)-coated BFO-NP in the form of cytotoxicity, haemolytic response and biocompatibility. Our results support the attractiveness of the functional-BFO towards biomedical applications focused on advanced diagnostic imaging. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Bismuth Ferrite nanoparticles (BFO-NP) have been recently successfully introduced as photodynamic tools and imaging probes. However, how these nanoparticles interact with various cells at the cellular level remains poorly understood.

METHODS: NE gene was amplified with RNA extracted from acute premyelocytic leukemia (APL) HL-60 cells as a template using reverse transcription-PCR. The coding sequence was cloned into shuttle plasmid pAdTrack-CMV to obtain the recombinant plasmid named pAd-NE. After digested with HindIII and EcoRV and sequenced, the pAd-NE was transformed to competent E.coli BJ5183 containing adenovirus backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1. The obtained recombinant adenovirus plasmid Ad-NE was digested with PacI and transfected into AD293 cells for packaging. Fourteen days later, primary recombinant adenovirus Ad-NE was harvested, and then subjected to five cycles of amplification, titer determination and PCR identification. K562 cells were infected by the recombinant adenovirus. The infection efficiency was observed under a fluorescence microscope and detected by flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to detect NE expression. The proliferation of K562 cells was detected by CCK-8 assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis was measured by annexin V/PI accompanied by flow cytometry. RESULTS: HindIII and EcoRV digestion and sequencing suggested that the recombinant vector Ad-NE was successfully constructed. The recombinant plasmid Ad-NE was packaged in AD293 cells as expected. Following five-cycle amplification, the viral titer was up to 1.64 x 10(1)(2) pfu/mL. GFP expression observed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry implied that the infection efficiency of Ad-NE in K562 cells reached about 80%. Western blotting showed that NE expression was up-regulated in K562 cells. CCK-8 assay revealed that the proliferation of K562 cells over-expressing NE was enhanced. Meanwhile, flow cytometry indicated that the K562 cells were arrested in S phase and the apoptosis rate was highly reduced. CONCLUSION: Over-expressed NE in K562 leukemia cells could promote cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis and block cell cycle in S phase.","['Jiang, Kailing', 'Ma, Pengpeng', 'Yang, Xiaoqun', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Wang, Hui', 'Zhu, Xinyu', 'Liu, Beizhong']","['Jiang K', 'Ma P', 'Yang X', 'Zhong L', 'Wang H', 'Zhu X', 'Liu B']","['Central Laboratory, Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Yongchuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,101139110,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Elastase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Transfection']",,,2015/02/06 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2015/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,"Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2015 Feb;31(2):159-62, 167.",['EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As expression of potentially self-(leukemia-) reactive TCRs will lead to negative selection or provoke autoimmunity upon thymic maturation, we investigated a novel concept whereby TCR expression set under the control of an inducible promoter would allow timely controlled TCR expression. After in vivo maturation and gene induction, preTs developed potent anti-leukemia effects. Engineered preTs provided protection even after repeated leukemia challenges by giving rise to effector and central memory cells. Importantly, adoptive transfer of TCR-transduced allogeneic preTs mediated anti-leukemia effect without evoking graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Earlier transgene induction forced CD8(+) T-cell development was required to obtain a mature T-cell subset of targeted specificity, allowed engineered T cells to efficiently pass positive selection and abrogated the endogenous T-cell repertoire. Later induction favored CD4 differentiation and failed to produce a leukemia-reactive population emphasizing the dominant role of positive selection. Taken together, we provide new functional insights for the employment of TCR-engineered precursor cells as a controllable immunotherapeutic modality with significant anti-leukemia activity.","['Hoseini, S S', 'Hapke, M', 'Herbst, J', 'Wedekind, D', 'Baumann, R', 'Heinz, N', 'Schiedlmeier, B', 'Vignali, D A A', 'van den Brink, M R M', 'Schambach, A', 'Blazar, B R', 'Sauer, M G']","['Hoseini SS', 'Hapke M', 'Herbst J', 'Wedekind D', 'Baumann R', 'Heinz N', 'Schiedlmeier B', 'Vignali DA', 'van den Brink MR', 'Schambach A', 'Blazar BR', 'Sauer MG']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Blood Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Blood Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Blood Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Central Animal Laboratory, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Clinic for Radiation Oncology, Hannover, Germany.', 'LOEWE Research Group for Gene Modification in Stem Cells, Paul-Ehrlich-Institute, Langen, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Immunology and Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'University of Minnesota Cancer Center and Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood & Marrow Transplantation, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Blood Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA072669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL056067/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150205,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Ovalbumin/genetics', 'Precursor Cells, T-Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC4607259,['NIHMS728349'],2015/02/06 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2015/02/06 06:00'],"['2014/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201520 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.20 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jul;29(7):1530-42. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.20.

We explored the activity, quality and molecular components of DSB repair in human HSPC as compared with mature peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). To consider chemotherapy/radiation-induced compensatory proliferation, we established cycling HSPC cultures. Comparison of pathway-specific repair activities using reporter systems revealed that HSPC were severely compromised in non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination but not microhomology-mediated end joining. We observed a more pronounced radiation-induced accumulation of nuclear 53BP1 in HSPC relative to PBL, despite evidence for comparable DSB formation from cytogenetic analysis and gammaH2AX signal quantification, supporting differential pathway usage. Functional screening excluded a major influence of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH-kinase (ATM/ATR/DNA-PK)- and p53-signaling as well as chromatin remodeling.

The utility of living cells to treat diseases was first proved in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for leukemia patients.

Since the 1980s, cells have been expanded outside of the body for the treatment of burn patients' skin. This novel treatment strategy is designated 'tissue engineering' and has been successfully applied for treatment of skin, cartilage, and also bone defects.

However, knowledge of the co-occurrence of such lesions and the relative influence of different types of genomic alterations on clinical outcomes in AML is still evolving. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed SNP 6.0 array-based genomic profiling of aCNA/copy neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (cnLOH) along with sequence analysis of 13 commonly mutated genes on purified leukemic blast DNA from 156 prospectively enrolled non-FAB-M3 AML patients across the clinical spectrum of de novo, secondary, and therapy-related AML. RESULTS: TP53 and RUNX1 mutations are strongly associated with the presence of SNP-A-based aCNA/cnLOH, while FLT3 and NPM1 mutations are strongly associated with the absence of aCNA/cnLOH. The presence of mutations in RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53, elevated SNP-A-based genomic complexity, and specific recurrent aCNAs predicted failure to achieve a complete response to induction chemotherapy. The presence of >/=1 aCNA/cnLOH and higher thresholds predicted for poor long-term survival irrespective of TP53 status, and the presence of >/=1 aCNA/cnLOH added negative prognostic information to knowledge of mutations in TET2, IDH1, NPM1, DNMT3A, and RUNX1. Results of multivariate analyses support a dominant role for TP53 mutations and a role for elevated genomic complexity as predictors of short survival in AML. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated genomic profiling of a clinically relevant adult AML cohort identified genomic aberrations most associated with SNP-A-based genomic complexity, resistance to intensive induction therapies, and shortened overall survival. Identifying SNP-A-based lesions adds prognostic value to the status of several recurrently mutated genes.","['Parkin, Brian', 'Ouillette, Peter', 'Yildiz, Mehmet', 'Saiya-Cork, Kamlai', 'Shedden, Kerby', 'Malek, Sami N']","['Parkin B', 'Ouillette P', 'Yildiz M', 'Saiya-Cork K', 'Shedden K', 'Malek SN']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Statistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. smalek@med.umich.edu.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009357-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30 CA46592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA171972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA171972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009357/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150204,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality/*therapy', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Transcriptome']",PMC4417381,['NIHMS661618'],2015/02/06 06:00,2016/04/01 06:00,['2015/02/06 06:00'],"['2014/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-14-0921 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0921 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2015 May 1;21(9):2045-56. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-0921.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 1.5-T brain MR images of 13 consecutive leukemia patients (3 girls, 10 boys; mean age, 8.23 years; range, 1-17 years) and 40 age- and gender-matched normal controls. We evaluated differences between leukemia patients and normal controls using Wilcoxon rank-sum and Mann-Whitney U tests with respect to the following parameters: (1) CPR on T1WI (CPRT1WI); (2) CPR on DWI (CPRDWI); (3) VS on T1WI (VST1WI); and (4) VS on DWI (VSDWI). RESULTS: The CPRT1WI values for leukemia patients and normal controls were 0.77 +/- 0.12 and 1.39 +/- 0.47, respectively (P < 0.001). The corresponding CPRDWI values were 1.03 +/- 0.38 and 0.50 +/- 0.17, respectively (P < 0.001). VST1WI and VSDWI were significantly different between the groups (P < 0.001 for both).

Whereas most protocols use permanently reprogrammed T cells, we have developed a platform for transient CAR expression by mRNA electroporation. This approach may be useful for safe clinical testing of novel receptors, or when a temporary treatment period is desirable. Herein, we investigated therapy with transiently redirected T cells in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. We constructed a series of CD19-specific CARs with different spacers and co-stimulatory domains (CD28, OX40 or CD28-OX40). The CAR constructs all conferred T cells with potent CD19-specific activity in vitro. Unexpectedly, the constructs incorporating a commonly used IgG1-CH2CH3 spacer showed lack of anti-leukemia activity in vivo and induced severe, partly CD19-independent toxicity. By contrast, identical CAR constructs without the CH2-domain eradicated leukemia in vivo, without notable toxicity. Follow-up studies demonstrated that the CH2CH3-spacer bound soluble mouse Fcgamma-receptor I and mediated off-target T-cell activation towards murine macrophages. Our findings highlight the importance of non-signalling CAR elements and of in vivo studies. Finally, the results show that transiently redirected T cells control leukemia in mice and support the rationale for developing an mRNA-CAR platform.","['Almasbak, H', 'Walseng, E', 'Kristian, A', 'Myhre, M R', 'Suso, E M', 'Munthe, L A', 'Andersen, J T', 'Wang, M Y', 'Kvalheim, G', 'Gaudernack, G', 'Kyte, J A']","['Almasbak H', 'Walseng E', 'Kristian A', 'Myhre MR', 'Suso EM', 'Munthe LA', 'Andersen JT', 'Wang MY', 'Kvalheim G', 'Gaudernack G', 'Kyte JA']","['Section for Cell Therapy, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', '1] Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway [2] Department of Cancer Biology, Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, FL, USA.', '1] Department of Tumor Biology, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway [2] KG Jebsen Center for Breast Cancer Research, Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cell Therapy, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cell Therapy, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', '1] Centre for Immune Regulation and Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway [2] Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Centre for Immune Regulation and Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cell Therapy, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cell Therapy, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Section for Cell Therapy, Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150205,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/immunology', 'CD28 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Therapy', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/*genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, OX40/genetics/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2015/02/06 06:00,2016/02/04 06:00,['2015/02/06 06:00'],"['2014/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['gt20154 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2015.4 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2015 May;22(5):391-403. doi: 10.1038/gt.2015.4.

When compared with other sources, single-unit CBT (sCBT) is associated with a delayed hematologic recovery, which may lead to a higher infection-related mortality (IRM). Co-infusion with the sCBT of CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells from a third-party donor (TPD) (sCBT + TPDCD34+) has been shown to markedly accelerate leukocyte recovery, potentially reducing the IRM. However, to our knowledge, no comparative studies have focused on severe infections and IRM with these 2 sCBT strategies. METHODS: A total of 148 consecutive sCBT (2000-2010, median follow-up 4.5 years) were included in a multicenter retrospective study to analyze the incidence and risk factors of IRM and severe viral and invasive fungal infections (IFIs). Neutrophil engraftment occurred in 90% of sCBT (n = 77) and 94% sCBT + TPDCD34+ (n = 71) recipients at a median of 23 and 12 days post transplantation, respectively (P < 0.01). RESULTS: The 4-year IRM was 24% and 20%, respectively (P = 0.7), with no differences at day +30 (5% and 4%, respectively) and day +100 (10% and 8%, respectively). In multivariate analysis early status of the underlying malignancy, cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seronegative recipient and high CD34+ cell content in the cord blood unit before cryostorage (>/=1.4 x 10(5) /kg) were protective of IRM. Among the causes of IRM, bacterial infections and IFIs were more common in sCBT (15% vs. 4%), while CMV disease and parasitic infections were more common in the sCBT + TPDCD34+ cohort (5% vs. 16%). CONCLUSION: These data show that sCBT supported with TPDCD34(+) cells results in much shorter periods of post-transplant leukopenia, but the short- and long-term rates of IRM were comparable to those of sCBT, presumably because immune recovery is equally delayed in both graft types.","['Martino, R', 'Bautista, G', 'Parody, R', 'Garcia, I', 'Esquirol, A', 'Rovira, M', 'Cabrera, J R', 'Regidor, C', 'Fores, R', 'Garcia-Marco, J A', 'Serrano, D', 'Barba, P', 'Heras, I', 'Marquez-Malaver, F J', 'Sanchez-Ortega, I', 'Duarte, R', 'Saavedra, S', 'Sierra, J', 'Vazquez, L']","['Martino R', 'Bautista G', 'Parody R', 'Garcia I', 'Esquirol A', 'Rovira M', 'Cabrera JR', 'Regidor C', 'Fores R', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Serrano D', 'Barba P', 'Heras I', 'Marquez-Malaver FJ', 'Sanchez-Ortega I', 'Duarte R', 'Saavedra S', 'Sierra J', 'Vazquez L']","['Clinical Hematology Service, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mycoses/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*therapeutic use', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Thiotepa/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Virus Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Whole-Body Irradiation', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/02/06 06:00,2016/01/01 06:00,['2015/02/06 06:00'],"['2014/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tid.12361 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2015 Apr;17(2):221-33. doi: 10.1111/tid.12361.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",['NOTNLM'],"['allogeneic', 'cord blood transplantation', 'severe infections']",['(c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Currently, new and highly effective therapeutic agents targeting BCR-mediated intracellular signal transduction have been incorporated into the CLL treatment armamentarium. These signal transduction inhibitors (STI) will change the algorithms of high-risk CLL (HR-CLL) management. Despite the limited body of evidence, there is sufficient rationale for withholding alloHSCT in patients with 17p-/TP53mut CLL in first remission. In contrast, the perspectives of patients with relapsed 17p-/TP53mut CLL remain uncertain even if responding to STI. The same accounts for patients with HR-CLL progressing under STI. In both scenarios, it is reasonable to consider alloHSCT, ideally after response to alternative STI regimens.","['Dreger, Peter', 'Montserrat, Emili']","['Dreger P', 'Montserrat E']","['Department Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany, Peter.dreger@med.uni-heidelberg.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*therapy', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Recurrence', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Withholding Treatment']",,,2015/02/06 06:00,2015/11/18 06:00,['2015/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-014-0242-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2015 Mar;10(1):59-64. doi: 10.1007/s11899-014-0242-1.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)']",,,,,,,"['European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)', 'European Research Initiative on CLL (ERIC)']",,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated whether SCRT suppresses the progression of AR in animal model. AR was induced by ovalbumin (OVA). Treatment with SCRT was assessed to study the effect of SCRT on AR in mice. Histological analysis, multiplex cytokine assay, blood analysis, cell viability assay, RT-PCR and Elisa assay were performed to verify inhibitory effect of SCRT on AR. SCRT reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells into nasal cavity. SCRT reduced infiltration of mast cells into nasal mucosa. SCRT reduced the levels of cytokines (IL-4 and LIF) in the serum. SCRT reduced the levels of leukocytes in the blood. SCRT decreased cell viability of HMC-1 cells and splenocyte. SCRT suppressed IL-4 level in HMC-1 cells and splenocyte cells in a dose-dependent manner. SCRT suppressed IL-6 level and TNF-alpha level in splenocyte.

Prompt recognition of these potentially fatal complications by cardiac computed tomography (CT) or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may help to direct clinicians to specific treatments according to causes. Thrombosis is often related to central venous catheter use and is usually located at the catheter tip near the atrial wall. Differentiation of thrombosis from normal structure is possible with CT and, distinction of a thrombus from a tumor is possible on a delayed enhancement MRI with a long inversion time (500-600 ms). Granulocytic sarcoma of the heart is indicated by an infiltrative nature with involvement of whole layers of myocardium on CT and MRI. MRI with T2* mapping is useful in evaluating myocardial iron content in patients with hemochromatosis. Diffuse subendocardial enhancement is typically observed on delayed MRIs in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. T1 mapping is an emerging tool to diagnose amyloidosis. Myocardial abscess can occur due to an immunocompromised status. CT and MRI show loculated lesions with fluid density and concomitant rim-like contrast enhancement. Awareness of CT and MRI findings of cardiac complications of hematologic diseases can be helpful to physicians for clinical decision making and treatment.","['Kim, Tae Yun', 'Jung, Jung Im', 'Kim, Yoo Jin', 'Kim, Hwan Wook', 'Lee, Hae Giu']","['Kim TY', 'Jung JI', 'Kim YJ', 'Kim HW', 'Lee HG']","[""Departments of Radiology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 137-701, Republic of Korea. ddongle13@hanmail.net."", ""Departments of Radiology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 137-701, Republic of Korea. jijung@catholic.ac.kr."", 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea. yoojink@catholic.ac.kr.', ""Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea. kimhwanwook@catholic.ac.kr."", ""Departments of Radiology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 222 Banpo-daero, Seocho-gu, Seoul, 137-701, Republic of Korea. hgleehfh@catholic.ac.kr.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150205,United States,Int J Cardiovasc Imaging,The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,100969716,IM,"['Abscess/diagnosis/etiology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amyloidosis/diagnosis/etiology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/etiology/pathology/therapy', 'Heart Neoplasms/diagnosis/etiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Multidetector Computed Tomography', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis/etiology', 'Thrombosis/diagnosis/etiology', 'Transfusion Reaction', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/02/06 06:00,2016/09/14 06:00,['2015/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10554-015-0610-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s10554-015-0610-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Cardiovasc Imaging. 2015 Dec;31 Suppl 2:159-67. doi: 10.1007/s10554-015-0610-5.

METHODS: The study group consisted of 25 children suffering from newly diagnosed B cell precursor ALL (B- ALL), involving immunophenotype pre-B and common-cALL. Peripheral blood samples were collected at the time of diagnosis, before any treatment, and after treatment. Soluble APRIL, soluble BAFF, and soluble TRAIL concentrations were assessed using ELISA kits. RESULTS: The concentrations of sAPRIL and sBAFF in the sera of the patient group were higher compared to the values of the control specimens. Among all molecules examined, the highest concentrations were found for the sAPRIL molecule. Furthermore, sAPRIL and sBAFF concentrations were higher in patients with ALL-pre B than in patients with cALL. After the treatment, the sera of patients with ALL-pre B contained lower concentrations of sAPRIL, sBAFF, and sTRAIL than those of the same patients before therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to earlier indications of the key function of BAFF in B-ALL, the quantitative dominance of APRIL in the serum suggests that this molecule can play an equivalent or even more significant role in this patient group than BAFF.","['Jablonska, Ewa', 'Dakowicz, Lucja', 'Ratajczak-Wrona, Wioletta', 'Garley, Marzena', 'Sawicka-Powierza, Jolanta', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna']","['Jablonska E', 'Dakowicz L', 'Ratajczak-Wrona W', 'Garley M', 'Sawicka-Powierza J', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/blood', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/*blood', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2015/02/06 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2015/02/06 06:00'],"['2015/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/clin.lab.2014.131207 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2014;60(10):1757-64. doi: 10.7754/clin.lab.2014.131207.,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (TNFSF13 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the role of soluble uric acid in NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages to demonstrate the effect of systemic hyperuricemia on progressive kidney damage in type 2 diabetes. THP-1 cells, human acute monocytic leukemia cells, were cultured to obtain macrophages, and HK-2 cells, human renal proximal tubule cells, were cultured and stimulated with uric acid. In vivo, we designed four rat groups as follows: 1) Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO); 2) Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF); 3) OLETF+high-fructose diet (HFD) for 16 wk; and 4) OLETF+HFD+allopurinol (10 mg/dl administered in the drinking water). Soluble uric acid stimulated NLRP3 inflammasomes to produce IL-1beta in macrophages. Uric acid-induced MitoSOX mediates NLRP3 activation and IL-1beta secretion. IL-1beta from macrophages activates NF-kappaB in cocultured proximal tubular cells. In vivo, intrarenal IL-1beta expression and macrophage infiltration increased in HFD-fed OLETF rats. Lowering the serum uric acid level resulted in improving the albuminuria, tubular injury, macrophage infiltration, and renal IL-1beta (60% of HFD-fed OLETF) independently of glycemic control.

Test results and patient demographic features were subjected to receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve, logistic regression and classification tree analyses to find significant predictors and develop decision rules. Our data show that, in the absence of a compelling clinical indication, flow cytometry testing is largely non-informative on bloods from patients less than 50 years of age having an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) below 5.0 x 10(9)/L. For patients over age 50 having an ALC below this value, a ferritin value above 450 mug/L is counter-indicative of B-cell clonality.

RESULTS: Ten years ago the phenotypic differences between LY-R (original L5178Y maintained in vivo and examined in vitro) and LY-S lines were reviewed in detail by the author. The loss of tumourigenicity of LY-R cells upon in vitro cultivation accompanying the acquirement of the LY-S phenotype had been described earlier by Beer et al. (1983). In spite of their common origin, the sublines were shown to differ in their relative sensitivity to a number of DNA damaging agents and in numerous other features. Here, selected differences between LY-R and LY-S lines are briefly reviewed. It is proposed that Wallace's concept (2010a) that mitochondria are the interface between environmental conditions and the genome may explain the LY-R-LY-S conversion under prolonged in vitro cultivation. CONCLUSION: The differences between the LY lines were probably of epigenetic rather than genetic character. The properties of LY-R cells changed as a result of exposure to an oxic in vitro milieu. The changes could be preconditioned by heteroplasmy and the selection of cells endowed with mitochondria best fitted to a high oxygen-low carbon dioxide environment.","['Szumiel, Irena']",['Szumiel I'],"['Centre for Radiobiology and Biological Dosimetry, Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology , Warsaw , Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150224,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Evolution', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Damage', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/radiation effects', 'Genomic Instability/radiation effects', 'Leukemia L5178/genetics/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/genetics/radiation effects', 'Oxidative Stress/radiation effects', 'Phenotype', '*Radiation Tolerance/genetics', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics/radiation effects']",,,2015/02/05 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/09553002.2014.996263 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2015 Jun;91(6):465-71. doi: 10.3109/09553002.2014.996263.

METHODS: Total 67 NK AML patients diagnosed during the recent 10 years were enrolled. DNMT3A mutations were analyzed by direct sequencing and categorized into nonsynonymous variations (NSV), deleterious mutations (DM), and R882 mutation based on in silico analysis results. Clinical features and prognosis were compared with respect to DNMT3A mutation status. RESULTS: Three novel (I158M, K219V, and E177V) and two known (R736H and R882H) NSVs were identified and the latter three were predicted as DMs. DNMT3A NSVs, DMs, and R882 mutation were identified in 14.9%-17.9%, 10.3%-10.4%, and 7.5% of patients, respectively. DNMT3A mutations were frequently detected in FLT3 ITD mutated patients (P=0.054, 0.071, and 0.071 in NSV, DMs, and R882 mutation, resp.) but did not affect clinical features and prognosis significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Incidences of DNMT3A NSVs, DMs, and R882 mutation are 14.9%-17.9%, 10.3%-10.4%, and 7.5%, respectively, in Korean NK AML patients. DNMT3A mutations are associated with FLT3 ITD mutations but do not affect clinical outcome significantly in Korean NK AML patients.","['Park, Sang Hyuk', 'Choi, Jae-Cheol', 'Kim, Shine Young', 'Yi, Jongyoun', 'Oh, Seung Hwan', 'Kim, In-Suk', 'Kim, Hyung-Hoi', 'Chang, Chulhun Ludgerus', 'Lee, Eun Yup', 'Song, Moo-Kon', 'Shin, Ho-Jin', 'Chung, Joo Seop']","['Park SH', 'Choi JC', 'Kim SY', 'Yi J', 'Oh SH', 'Kim IS', 'Kim HH', 'Chang CL', 'Lee EY', 'Song MK', 'Shin HJ', 'Chung JS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan 602-739, Republic of Korea ; Biomedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan 602-739, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hanmaeum Hospital, 21 Woni-daero, 682 Beon-gil, Seongsan-gu, Changwon-si, Gyeongsangnam-do 642-832, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan 602-739, Republic of Korea ; Biomedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan 602-739, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan 602-739, Republic of Korea ; Biomedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan 602-739, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Inje University College of Medicine, 75 Bokji-ro, Busanjin-gu, Busan 614-735, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, 20 Geumo-ro, Mulgeum-eup, Yangsan-si, Gyeongsangnam-do 626-770, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan 602-739, Republic of Korea ; Biomedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan 602-739, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, 20 Geumo-ro, Mulgeum-eup, Yangsan-si, Gyeongsangnam-do 626-770, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan 602-739, Republic of Korea ; Biomedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan 602-739, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan 602-739, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan 602-739, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Pusan National University Hospital, 179 Gudeok-ro, Seo-gu, Busan 602-739, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150111,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians/*genetics/statistics & numerical data', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",PMC4306257,,2015/02/05 06:00,2015/09/29 06:00,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2014/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/22 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/723682 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:723682. doi: 10.1155/2015/723682.

In Korea, radiation exposure is monitored and recorded by law, and guidelines for compensation of radiation-related diseases were implemented in 2001. However, thus far, no occupation-related disease was approved for compensation under these guidelines. Here, we report the first case of radiation-related disease approved by the compensation committee of the Korea Workers' Compensation and Welfare Service, based on the probability of causation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old man complained of chronic fatigue and myalgia for several days. He was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia. The patient was a diagnostic radiographer at a diagnostic radiation department and was exposed to ionizing radiation for 21 years before chronic myeloid leukemia was diagnosed. His job involved taking simple radiographs, computed tomography scans, and measuring bone marrow density. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first approved case report using quantitative assessment of radiation. More approved cases are expected based on objective radiation exposure data and the probability of causation. We need to find a resolution to the ongoing demands for appropriate compensation and improvements to the environment at radiation workplaces.","['Park, Chulyong', 'Choi, Sungyeul', 'Kim, Dohyung', 'Park, Jaechan', 'Lee, Saerom']","['Park C', 'Choi S', 'Kim D', 'Park J', 'Lee S']","['Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, KOSHA, Ulsan, Korea.', 'Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, KOSHA, Ulsan, Korea.', 'Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, KOSHA, Ulsan, Korea.', 'Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, KOSHA, Ulsan, Korea.', 'Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, KOSHA, Ulsan, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20141128,Korea (South),Ann Occup Environ Med,Annals of occupational and environmental medicine,101609244,,,PMC4312440,,2015/02/05 06:00,2015/02/05 06:01,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2014/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40557-014-0054-8 [doi]', '54 [pii]']",epublish,Ann Occup Environ Med. 2014 Nov 28;26(1):54. doi: 10.1186/s40557-014-0054-8. eCollection 2014.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Diagnostic radiation', 'Occupational diseases', 'Occupational radiation', 'Probability of causation', ""Workers' compensation""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We here propose a consensus on methodologies used to detect KIT mutations in patients with mastocytosis at diagnosis and during follow-up with sufficient precision and sensitivity in daily practice. In addition, we provide recommendations for sampling and storage of diagnostic material as well as a robust diagnostic algorithm. Using highly sensitive assays, KIT D816V can be detected in peripheral blood leukocytes from most patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM) that is a major step forward in screening and SM diagnosis. In addition, the KIT D816V allele burden can be followed quantitatively during the natural course or during therapy. Our recommendations should greatly facilitate diagnostic and follow-up investigations in SM in daily practice as well as in clinical trials. In addition, the new tools and algorithms proposed should lead to a more effective screen, early diagnosis of SM and help to avoid unnecessary referrals.","['Arock, M', 'Sotlar, K', 'Akin, C', 'Broesby-Olsen, S', 'Hoermann, G', 'Escribano, L', 'Kristensen, T K', 'Kluin-Nelemans, H C', 'Hermine, O', 'Dubreuil, P', 'Sperr, W R', 'Hartmann, K', 'Gotlib, J', 'Cross, N C P', 'Haferlach, T', 'Garcia-Montero, A', 'Orfao, A', 'Schwaab, J', 'Triggiani, M', 'Horny, H-P', 'Metcalfe, D D', 'Reiter, A', 'Valent, P']","['Arock M', 'Sotlar K', 'Akin C', 'Broesby-Olsen S', 'Hoermann G', 'Escribano L', 'Kristensen TK', 'Kluin-Nelemans HC', 'Hermine O', 'Dubreuil P', 'Sperr WR', 'Hartmann K', 'Gotlib J', 'Cross NC', 'Haferlach T', 'Garcia-Montero A', 'Orfao A', 'Schwaab J', 'Triggiani M', 'Horny HP', 'Metcalfe DD', 'Reiter A', 'Valent P']","['1] Molecular Oncology and Pharmacology, LBPA CNRS UMR8113, Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan, Cachan, France [2] Laboratory of Hematology, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', 'Institute of Pathology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', ""Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Dermatology and Allergy Centre, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Servicio Central de Citometria, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC, CSIC/USAL), IBSAL and Department of Medicine, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Faculty of Medicine and AP-HP Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris Descartes University, Paris, France.', '1] Signaling, Hematopoiesis and Mechanism of Oncogenesis, Inserm U1068, CRCM, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille University, UM 105, Marseille, France [4] CNRS, UMR7258, CRCM, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, MD, USA.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury, and Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Servicio Central de Citometria, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC, CSIC/USAL), IBSAL and Department of Medicine, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Servicio Central de Citometria, Centro de Investigacion del Cancer (IBMCC, CSIC/USAL), IBSAL and Department of Medicine, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'III, Medical Clinic, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, University of Salerno, Salerno, Italy.', 'Institute of Pathology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'III, Medical Clinic, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['F 4611/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'F 4704/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150204,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/*pathology', '*Mastocytosis', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics']",PMC4522520,['EMS64251'],2015/02/05 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2014/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201524 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.24 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jun;29(6):1223-32. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.24.

The median maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUV max) in the presence of a CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma, a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), a SM were 3.5, 14.6, 7.0 and 6.3, respectively (P 0.0001). A SUV max cutoff value 5 showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 88.2, 71.2, 51.3 and 94%, respectively, for the presence of a more aggressive disease (DLBCL, HL and SM). A SUV max 5 identified also a subset of treatment naive patients with an inferior progression-free survival (P = 0.011) and overall survival (P = 0.067).

Activating mutations in Shp2 are commonly associated with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia but are not as well defined in other neoplasms. Here we report that Shp2 mutations occur in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at a rate of 6.6% (6/91) in the ECOG E1900 data set. We examined the role of mutated Shp2 in leukemias harboring MLL translocations, which co-occur in human AML. The hyperactive Shp2E76K mutant, commonly observed in leukemia patients, significantly accelerated MLL-AF9-mediated leukemogenesis in vivo. Shp2E76K increased leukemic stem cell frequency and affords MLL-AF9 leukemic cells IL3 cytokine hypersensitivity. As Shp2 is reported to regulate anti-apoptotic genes, we investigated Bcl2, Bcl-xL and Mcl1 expression in MLL-AF9 leukemic cells with and without Shp2E76K. Although the Bcl2 family of genes was upregulated in Shp2E76K cells, Mcl1 showed the highest upregulation in MLL-AF9 cells in response to Shp2E76K. Indeed, expression of Mcl1 in MLL-AF9 cells phenocopies expression of Shp2E76K, suggesting Shp2 mutations cooperate through activation of anti-apoptotic genes. Finally, we show Shp2E76K mutations reduce sensitivity of AML cells to small-molecule-mediated Mcl1 inhibition, suggesting reduced efficacy of drugs targeting MCL1 in patients with hyperactive Shp2.","['Chen, L', 'Chen, W', 'Mysliwski, M', 'Serio, J', 'Ropa, J', 'Abulwerdi, F A', 'Chan, R J', 'Patel, J P', 'Tallman, M S', 'Paietta, E', 'Melnick, A', 'Levine, R L', 'Abdel-Wahab, O', 'Nikolovska-Coleska, Z', 'Muntean, A G']","['Chen L', 'Chen W', 'Mysliwski M', 'Serio J', 'Ropa J', 'Abulwerdi FA', 'Chan RJ', 'Patel JP', 'Tallman MS', 'Paietta E', 'Melnick A', 'Levine RL', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Nikolovska-Coleska Z', 'Muntean AG']","['1] Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA [2] Department of Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '1] Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA [2] Department of Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '1] Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA [2] Department of Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '1] Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA [2] Department of Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '1] Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA [2] Department of Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '1] Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA [2] Interdepartmental Program in Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '1] Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA [2] Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Montefiore Medical Center-North Division, Immunology Laboratory, Cancer Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', '1] Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA [2] Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', '1] Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA [2] Department of Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', '1] Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA [2] Department of Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA149442/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA196172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA149442/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180827/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA158136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150204,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4456293,['NIHMS660010'],2015/02/05 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201518 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.18 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jun;29(6):1290-300. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.18.

Plain radiographs and MRI showed fractures of the superior endplate of T5 and T6 associated with a mild degree of kyphosis. MRI allowed ruling out discitis. The diagnostic hypotheses raised were cancer (lymphoma, leukemia), Langerhans cell histiocytosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, and CRMO. A whole-body MRI (wbMRI) was performed and disclosed several clinically silent signal abnormalities in key sites of CRMO (pelvic bone and tibial metaphyses). We point out that CRMO should be systematically added to the list of possible diseases in case of vertebral fracture. In this perspective, wbMRI is a major noninvasive tool to assess the diagnosis of CRMO, and allows avoiding a bone biopsy in most cases.","['Galeotti, C', 'Tatencloux, S', 'Adamsbaum, C', 'Kone-Paut, I']","['Galeotti C', 'Tatencloux S', 'Adamsbaum C', 'Kone-Paut I']","['Service de pediatrie generale, rhumatologie pediatrique, centre national de reference des maladies auto-inflammatoires, CEREMAI, CHU Bicetre, 78, rue du General-Leclerc, 94270 Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France.

The aim of this study was to experimentally assess the interaction between canine parvovirus (CPV) and a widely distributed hard tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, in laboratory condition. After inoculation of CPV into the hemocoel of the ticks, polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that CPV persisted in inoculated unfed adult female ticks for 28 days. Canine parvovirus was recovered from the inoculated ticks using a cell culture, indicating that the virus retained intact in the ticks after inoculation, but significant positive reaction indicating virus infection was not detected in the tick organs by immunofluorescence antibody test using a monoclonal antibody. In the case of ticks inoculated with feline leukemia virus, the virus had shorter persistence in the ticks compared to CPV. These findings provide significant important information on the characteristic interaction of tick with non-tick-borne virus.","['Mori, Hiroyuki', 'Tanaka, Tetsuya', 'Mochizuki, Masami']","['Mori H', 'Tanaka T', 'Mochizuki M']","['Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Kagoshima University, 890-0065, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141219,Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Ixodidae/*virology', 'Larva/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/physiology', 'Nymph/virology', 'Ovum', 'Parvovirus, Canine/*physiology']",PMC4427740,,2015/02/05 06:00,2016/01/29 06:00,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1292/jvms.14-0199 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 2015 Apr;77(4):405-11. doi: 10.1292/jvms.14-0199.

The complications of HHV-6 reactivation in this setting are mainly recognized as HHV-6 encephalitis. We herein report the case of a patient who developed HHV-6 pneumonitis after cord blood transplantation (CBT). A 35-year-old male underwent CBT for T-cell/myeloid mixed phenotype acute leukemia and achieved neutrophil engraftment on day 31. He had received foscarnet as prophylaxis for HHV-6 reactivation. A computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate the leukemic tumor showed bilateral interstitial pneumonitis on day 33, although he had no respiratory symptoms. The findings of the CT scan were consistent with those of HHV-6 pneumonitis that were reported previously. HHV-6 DNA, but no other pathogens, was detected in his bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The patient was successfully treated with a therapeutic dose of foscarnet. This case indicates that performing a CT scan around the time of neutrophil engraftment can play an important role in detecting the early phase of HHV-6 pneumonia, and BAL should be considered if features consistent with HHV-6 pneumonitis are observed in patients with a risk of HHV-6 reactivation.","['Ishio, Takashi', 'Endo, Tomoyuki', 'Okada, Kohei', 'Shigematsu, Akio', 'Hashino, Satoshi', 'Teshima, Takanori']","['Ishio T', 'Endo T', 'Okada K', 'Shigematsu A', 'Hashino S', 'Teshima T']","['Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Hospital, Kita-15 Nishi-7, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Hospital, Kita-15 Nishi-7, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Hospital, Kita-15 Nishi-7, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Hospital, Kita-15 Nishi-7, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Hospital, Kita-15 Nishi-7, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0815, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Hospital, Kita-15 Nishi-7, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-0815, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150111,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,PMC4306254,,2015/02/05 06:00,2015/02/05 06:01,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2014/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/949265 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2015;2015:949265. doi: 10.1155/2015/949265.

Here, B-lineage ALL cell cultures derived from a set of primary tumors were studied with respect to sensitivity to the BH3 mimetics ABT-263 and ABT-199 and to Bcl-2 dependence and function. These ALL cells each expressed high levels of Bcl-2 and exhibited great sensitivity to ABT-263 and ABT-199, which induced rapid apoptotic cell death. BH3 profiling indicated that the ALL cultures were Bcl-2 dependent. Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed a multifaceted role for Bcl-2 in binding proapoptotic partners including Bax, Bak, Bik, and Bim. ABT-263 disrupted Bcl-2:Bim interaction in cells. Mcl-1 overexpression rendered ALL cells resistant to ABT-263 and ABT-199, with Mcl-1 assuming the role of Bcl-2 in binding Bim. Freshly isolated pediatric ALL blasts also expressed high levels of Bcl-2 and exhibited high sensitivity to Bcl-2 inhibition by the BH3 mimetic compounds. Overall, our results showed that primary ALL cultures were both more sensitive to BH3 mimetics and more uniform in their response than established ALL cell lines that have been evaluated previously. Furthermore, the primary cell model characterized here offers a powerful system for preclinical testing of novel drugs and drug combinations to treat ALL.","['Alford, Sarah E', 'Kothari, Anisha', 'Loeff, Floris C', 'Eichhorn, Joshua M', 'Sakurikar, Nandini', 'Goselink, Henriette M', 'Saylors, Robert L', 'Jedema, Inge', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'Chambers, Timothy C']","['Alford SE', 'Kothari A', 'Loeff FC', 'Eichhorn JM', 'Sakurikar N', 'Goselink HM', 'Saylors RL', 'Jedema I', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Chambers TC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences at Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, Arkansas."", 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas. chamberstimothyc@uams.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA109821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000039/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-109821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1TR000039/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150203,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",PMC4383710,['NIHMS661211'],2015/02/05 06:00,2016/01/24 06:00,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2014/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-14-1849 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-1849 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2015 Apr 1;75(7):1366-75. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-1849.

METHODS: Ten and 100 BV-173 leukemic cells were embedded in a fibrin matrix along with 50,000 human ovarian stromal cells, and grafted to the peritoneal bursa of 5 and 5 SCID mice respectively. Four mice grafted with 3x10(6) leukemic cells in fibrin served as positive controls. At 20 weeks post-transplantation, the grafts, liver, spleen, blood and bone marrow were analyzed for the presence of leukemia by anti-CD79alpha IHC, flow cytometry (FC) and PCR. RESULTS: All mice grafted with 3x10(6) cells developed peritoneal masses 4 weeks after xenotransplantation, and systemic disease was confirmed by IHC, PCR and FC. Among mice grafted with 10 or 100 leukemic cells, none showed any sign of leukemia after 20 weeks, and IHC, FC and PCR on the different recovered tissues all proved negative. CONCLUSION: This study investigates the tumor-inducing potential of a few leukemic cells grafted inside an artificial ovary. Transplantation of 100 leukemic cells appears to be insufficient to induce leukemia after 20 weeks. These results in an immunodeficient xenografting model are quite reassuring. However, for clinical application, follicle suspensions must be purged of leukemic cells before grafting, as even the slightest risk should be avoided.","['Soares, Michelle', 'Saussoy, Pascale', 'Sahrari, Karima', 'Amorim, Christiani A', 'Donnez, Jacques', 'Dolmans, Marie-Madeleine']","['Soares M', 'Saussoy P', 'Sahrari K', 'Amorim CA', 'Donnez J', 'Dolmans MM']","['Pole de Recherche en Gynecologie, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150204,Netherlands,J Assist Reprod Genet,Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics,9206495,IM,"['Animals', '*Artificial Organs', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/*methods', '*Ovary', 'Stromal Cells/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/methods']",PMC4380902,,2015/02/05 06:00,2015/12/25 06:00,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2014/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10815-015-0438-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Assist Reprod Genet. 2015 Apr;32(4):597-606. doi: 10.1007/s10815-015-0438-x.

In a retrospective population-based cohort study predicated on comprehensive national health registers, we identified a cohort of 32,308 one-year survivors of cancer diagnosed before the age of 20 in the five Nordic countries between the start of cancer registration in the 1940s and 1950s to 2008; 211,489 population comparison subjects were selected from national population registers. Study subjects were linked to national hospital registers, and the observed numbers of first hospital admission for cardiovascular disease among survivors were compared with the expected numbers derived from the population comparison cohort. Cardiovascular disease was diagnosed in 2,632 childhood cancer survivors (8.1%), yielding a standardized hospitalization rate ratio (RR) of 2.1 (95% CI 2.0-2.2) and an overall absolute excess risk (AER) of 324 per 100,000 person-years. At the end of follow-up 12% of the survivors were >/= 50 years of age and 4.5% >/= 60 years of age. Risk estimates were significantly increased throughout life, with an AER of approximately 500-600 per 100,000 person-years at age >/= 40. The highest relative risks were seen for heart failure (RR, 5.2; 95% CI 4.5-5.9), valvular dysfunction (4.6; 3.8-5.5) and cerebrovascular diseases (3.7; 3.4-4.1). Survivors of hepatic tumor, Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia had the highest overall risks for cardiovascular disease, although each main type of childhood cancer had increased risk with different risk profiles. Nordic childhood cancer survivors are at markedly increased risk for cardiovascular disorders throughout life. These findings indicate the need for preventive interventions and continuous follow-up for this rapidly growing population.","['Gudmundsdottir, Thorgerdur', 'Winther, Jeanette F', 'de Fine Licht, Sofie', 'Bonnesen, Trine G', 'Asdahl, Peter H', 'Tryggvadottir, Laufey', 'Anderson, Harald', 'Wesenberg, Finn', 'Malila, Nea', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Olsen, Jorgen H']","['Gudmundsdottir T', 'Winther JF', 'de Fine Licht S', 'Bonnesen TG', 'Asdahl PH', 'Tryggvadottir L', 'Anderson H', 'Wesenberg F', 'Malila N', 'Hasle H', 'Olsen JH']","['Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'The Icelandic Cancer Registry, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Laeknagardur, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Department of Cancer Epidemiology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oslo University Hospital, Nydalen, Oslo, Norway.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Blindern, Oslo, Norway.', 'The Norwegian Cancer Registry, Majorstuen, Oslo, Norway.', 'Finnish Cancer Registry, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150314,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/classification/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/classification/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/02/05 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2014/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.29468 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2015 Sep 1;137(5):1176-86. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29468.

We previously showed that IGF-2, which binds IGF-IR, is an extrinsic factor that supports the ex vivo expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We also demonstrated that IGF-IR is not required for HSC activity in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we investigated the role of IGF-IR in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) using the retroviral BCR/ABL transplantation mouse model. Existing antibodies against IGF-IR are not suitable for flow cytometry; therefore, we generated a fusion of the human IgG Fc fragment with mutant IGF-2 that can bind to IGF-IR. We used this fusion protein to evaluate mouse primary hematopoietic populations. Through transplantation assays with IGF-IR(+) and IGF-IR(-) cells, we demonstrated that IGF-IR is expressed on all mouse HSCs. The expression of IGF-IR is much higher on CML cells than on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. The depletion of IGF-IR expression in BCR/ABL(+) cells led to the development of ALL (mostly T cell ALL) but not CML. Lack of IGF-IR resulted in decreased self-renewal of the BCR/ABL(+) CML cells in the serial replating assay. CONCLUSION: IGF-IR regulates the cell fate determination of BCR/ABL(+) leukemia cells and supports the self-renewal of CML cells.","['Xie, Jingjing', 'Chen, Xiaoli', 'Zheng, Junke', 'Li, Chunling', 'Stacy, Satomi', 'Holzenberger, Martin', 'Hu, Xuemei', 'Zhang, Cheng Cheng']","['Xie J', 'Chen X', 'Zheng J', 'Li C', 'Stacy S', 'Holzenberger M', 'Hu X', 'Zhang CC']","['Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Binzhou Medical University, 264003, Yantai, Shandong, China. jjx.cau@139.com.', 'Departments of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 75390, Dallas, TX, USA. xiaoli.chen@utsouthwestern.edu.', 'Departments of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 75390, Dallas, TX, USA. junke.zheng@utsouthwestern.edu.', 'Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Binzhou Medical University, 264003, Yantai, Shandong, China. bzyxylcl@163.com.', 'Departments of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 75390, Dallas, TX, USA. satomi.stacy@utsouthwestern.edu.', 'INSERM and Sorbonne Universities, UPMC, Research Center UMR938, 75012, Paris, France. martin.holzenberger@inserm.fr.', 'Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Binzhou Medical University, 264003, Yantai, Shandong, China. xue-mei-hu@163.com.', 'Taishan Scholar Immunology Program, Binzhou Medical University, 264003, Yantai, Shandong, China. alec.zhang@utsouthwestern.edu.', 'Departments of Physiology and Developmental Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 75390, Dallas, TX, USA. alec.zhang@utsouthwestern.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA172268/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA172268/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150204,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",PMC4320836,,2015/02/05 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2014/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-015-0106-8 [doi]', 's13045-015-0106-8 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2015 Feb 4;8:3. doi: 10.1186/s13045-015-0106-8.,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper examines the effect of curcumin on etoposide action in leukemic and normal bone marrow cells in vivo conditions. The experimental model used was Brown Norway rats with a transplantable acute promyelocytic leukemia. Leukemia was induced by intravenous injection of BNML (Brown Norway Myeloid Leukemia) cells. Curcumin was administered by oral gavage (200 mg/kg) for 23 consecutive days and etoposide was used intraperitoneally (50 mg/kg) for the last three days of the experiment. Control leukemic and healthy rats received the solvent for the tested compounds only. Curcumin significantly reduced the number of leukemic promyelocytes in the bone marrow of BNML rats in comparison to the leukemic control. Treatment with curcumin plus etoposide led to a decrease in the number of promyelocytes to the normal values occurring in healthy individuals. In contrast, the percentage of the normal precursors of granulocytes (p <0.001) and erythrocytes (p <0.001) increased significantly in comparison to the group treated with only etoposide. The results of the study indicate that curcumin may protect healthy myeloid cells against the cytotoxic effect of etoposide and potentiate the antileukemic action of this anticancer drug.","['Papiez, Monika A', 'Krzysciak, Wirginia']","['Papiez MA', 'Krzysciak W']","['Department of Cytobiology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland. monika.papiez@uj.edu.pl.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Poland,Folia Med Cracov,Folia medica Cracoviensia,0374617,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Curcumin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN']",,,2015/02/05 06:00,2015/05/30 06:00,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Folia Med Cracov. 2014;54(2):71-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'bone marrow', 'curcumin', 'etoposide', 'rats']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genes from Catharanthus roseus encoding strictosidine synthase (STR) and geraniol 10-hydroxylase (G10H), were separately and simultaneously introduced into Ophiorrhiza pumila hairy roots. Overexpression of individual G10H (G lines) significantly improved CPT production with respect to non-transgenic hairy root cultures (NC line) and single STR overexpressing lines (S lines), indicating that G10H plays a more important role in stimulating CPT accumulation than STR in O. pumila. Furthermore, co-overexpression of G10H and STR genes (SG Lines) caused a 56% increase on the yields of CPT compared to NC line and single gene transgenic lines, showed that simultaneous introduction of G10H and STR can produce a synergistic effect on CPT biosynthesis in O. pumila. The MTT assay results indicated that CPT extracted from different lines showed similar anti-tumor activity, suggesting that transgenic O. pumila hairy root lines could be an alternative approach to obtain CPT. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the enhancement of CPT production in O. pumila employing a metabolic engineering strategy.","['Cui, Lijie', 'Ni, Xiaoling', 'Ji, Qian', 'Teng, Xiaojuan', 'Yang, Yanru', 'Wu, Chao', 'Zekria, David', 'Zhang, Dasheng', 'Kai, Guoyin']","['Cui L', 'Ni X', 'Ji Q', 'Teng X', 'Yang Y', 'Wu C', 'Zekria D', 'Zhang D', 'Kai G']","['Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Development Center of Plant Germplasm Resources, College of Life and Environment Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Development Center of Plant Germplasm Resources, College of Life and Environment Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China.', 'Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Development Center of Plant Germplasm Resources, College of Life and Environment Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China.', 'Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Development Center of Plant Germplasm Resources, College of Life and Environment Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China.', 'Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Development Center of Plant Germplasm Resources, College of Life and Environment Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'Shanghai Chenshan Plant Science Research Center, Shanghai Chenshan Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai201602, China.', '1] Laboratory of Plant Biotechnology, Development Center of Plant Germplasm Resources, College of Life and Environment Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai 200234, China [2] Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory for Genetic Improvement and Quality Control of Medicinal Plants, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou 310018, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150204,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/biosynthesis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Biosynthetic Pathways', 'Camptothecin/biosynthesis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Carbon-Nitrogen Lyases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Plant Roots/genetics', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Rubiaceae/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC4316170,,2015/02/05 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2014/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['srep08227 [pii]', '10.1038/srep08227 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Feb 4;5:8227. doi: 10.1038/srep08227.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.- (geraniol 10-hydroxylase)', 'EC 4.3.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Lyases)', 'EC 4.3.3.2 (strictosidine synthetase)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leptin, considered a link between cancer and obesity, has been reported to be actively involved in hemopoiesis and pathophysiology of CML. There are few and conflicting reports about the status of serum leptin levels and recently alteration in leptin has been reported due to imatinib mesylate. METHODS: Leptin and CRP were estimated in 30 (male: 20; female: 10) newly diagnosed and confirmed MBCR- ABL p210 positive CML patients before and after 3 months of therapy by commercial enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. Leptin levels were compared with 30 (male: 20; female: 10) age matched healthy controls accounting for the differences due BMI and gender. RESULTS: Leptin/BMI ratio was significantly raised in both male and female chronic phase patients as compared to controls (p < 0.001, p = 0.048) and accelerated phase patients as compared to controls (males, p < 0.001; females, p < 0.001). The normal gender difference and dependence on BMI was lost in patients. In patients, who failed to achieve hematological baseline, leptin/BMI was higher only in male patients (p = 0.012). Leptin/BMI also correlat- ed with TLC and blast percentage (TLC, R2 = 0.412, p = 0.001; Blast %, R2 = 0.408, p < 0.001). There was no correlation between leptin and CRP levels. Levels decreased significantly after complete hematological remission in both males and females (p = 0.001, p = 0.028). Levels after 3 months of imatinib therapy were significantly higher than controls in all patients not in remission (males, p < 0.001; females, p = 0.018) but only in male patients in re- mission (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Leptin levels were increased in CML patients. The findings suggest a possible role of leptin in patho- genesis of CML or disease progression independent of inflammatory state or reactionary rise. Imatinib itself may increase leptin levels, and, as leptin plays an active role in the pathophysiology of CML, this conflicting scenario needs further investigation. Alterations in leptin need to be investigated cautiously accounting for confounding and differences due to BMI and gender.","['Bansal, Piyush', 'Ghalaut, Veena S', 'Sharma, Tarun K', 'Ghalaut, Pratap S', 'Dokwal, Sumit', 'Ghalaut, Ragini', 'Kulshrestha, Manish', 'Dahiya, Kiran']","['Bansal P', 'Ghalaut VS', 'Sharma TK', 'Ghalaut PS', 'Dokwal S', 'Ghalaut R', 'Kulshrestha M', 'Dahiya K']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leptin/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2015/02/05 06:00,2015/03/12 06:00,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/clin.lab.2014.140126 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2014;60(11):1845-52. doi: 10.7754/clin.lab.2014.140126.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Genomic DNA from 53 CN-AML patients were amplified by PCR and followed by fragment analysis of post-PCR products using GeneMapper software for detection of NPM1 mutations. RESULTS: NPM1 exon 12 mutations were found are 15/53 CN-AML patients (28.3%) including 3 of M1, 3 of M2, 5 of M4, 3 of M5, and 1 of M6 FAB subtypes. The NPM1 mutation was significantly associated with lower relapse rate (p < 0.05).

At the 14th Preventive Pediatrics Symposium, which took place in Skrad, June 1' 2013, from preventive standpoint, the following chronic childhood illnesses were discussed: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder--ADHD, migraine, thyroid gland diseases, leukemia, cystic fibrosis, chronic renal disease, chronic inflammatory liver disease, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and chronic otitis media with effusion. It is emphasized that talking about a disease prevention, there are three levels of it--primary, second- ary and tertiary prevention: how to avoid occurrence of disease, how to diagnose and treat existent disease in early stages, before it causes significant morbidity, and finally how to reduce the negative impact of existent disease by restoring function and reducing disease-related complications--how to improve quality of life of children with chronic diseases. Quaternary prevention describes methods to mitigate or avoid results of unnecessary or excessive interventions of the health system. An important process is also transition of care from child-oriented to adult-oriented care. Adults with chronic health conditions should continue to be evaluated periodically for possible late consequences of their childhood illness and previ- ous medical treatments.","['Batinica, Maja', 'Grguric, Josip', 'Jadrijevic-Cvrlje, Filip']","['Batinica M', 'Grguric J', 'Jadrijevic-Cvrlje F']",,['hrv'],,['Editorial'],,Croatia,Lijec Vjesn,Lijecnicki vjesnik,0074253,IM,"['Biomedical Research', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', '*Pediatrics', 'Preventive Health Services/*organization & administration', 'Quality of Life']",,,2015/02/05 06:00,2015/10/23 06:00,['2015/02/05 06:00'],"['2015/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Lijec Vjesn. 2014 Nov-Dec;136(11-12):346-9.,,,,,,,,,,,Prevencija kronicnih bolesti i stanja u djece--2. dio: naglasci s xiv.

Even though cisplatin treatment after surgical resection of the primary tumor has been established as a standard chemotherapy for residual disease including metastatic spread, NSCLC often acquires a resistance against chemotherapy, and metastatic disease is often observed. Amongst many potential mechanisms, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been considered as an important process in acquiring both metastatic spread and chemo-resistance of NSCLC. In this study, we identified MCL-1 as a critical molecule for chemo-resistance in A549 cells associated with TGF-beta-induced EMT. Importantly, downregulation of MCL-1 by siRNA or inhibition of MCL-1 with pan-BCL2 inhibitor to inhibit MCL-1 was able to overcome the EMT-associated chemo-resistance in A549 cells.

However, it is unclear whether these two genes participate in adriamycin (ADR)resistant leukemia. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate FANCF and FANCD2 expression in drugresistant and drugsensitive leukemia cells. Western blot analysis revealed enhanced FANCF expression and monoubiquitination of FANCD2 in ADRresistant cells. Additionally, it was observed that drugresistant cells had reduced DNA damage compared with drugsensitive cells. The results of this study indicate that the FA pathway may confer leukemia resistance to ADR via enhanced DNA interstrand crosslink repair.","['Yao, Chenjiao', 'Du, Wei', 'Chen, Haibiug', 'Xiao, Sheng', 'Huang, Lihua', 'Chen, Fang-Ping']","['Yao C', 'Du W', 'Chen H', 'Xiao S', 'Huang L', 'Chen FP']","['Department of Hematology, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410008, P.R.

Nitidine Chloride (NC), a natural bioactive alkaloid, is suggested to possess anti-tumor effects. However, the function of NC in leukemia and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been established. In this study, we found that NC induced erythroid differentiation, accompanied by increased expression of erythroid differentiation markers, e. g. alpha-, epsilon-, gamma-globin, CD235a, CD71 and alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) in CML cells. We also observed that NC induced apoptosis and upregulated cleaved caspase-3 and Parp-1 in K562 cells. These effects were associated with concomitant attenuation of c-Myc. Our study showed that NC treatment in CML cells enhanced phosphorylation of Thr58 residue and subsequently accelerated degradation of c-Myc. A specific group of miRNAs, which had been reported to be activated by c-Myc, mediated biological functions of c-Myc. We found that most of these miRNAs, especially miR-17 and miR-20a showed strong decrement after NC treatment or c-Myc interference. Furthermore, overexpression of c-Myc or miR-17/20a alleviated NC induced differentiation and apoptosis in K562 cells. More importantly, NC enhanced the effects of imatinib in K562 and primary CML cells. We further found that even imatinib resistant CML cell line (K562/G01) and CML primary cells exhibited high sensitivity to NC, which showed potential possibility to overcome imatinib resistance. Taken together, our results clearly suggested that NC promoted erythroid differentiation and apoptosis through c-Myc-miRNAs regulatory axis, providing potential possibility to overcome imatinib resistance.","['Liu, Na', 'Li, Peng', 'Zang, Shaolei', 'Liu, Qiang', 'Ma, Daoxin', 'Sun, Xiulian', 'Ji, Chunyan']","['Liu N', 'Li P', 'Zang S', 'Liu Q', 'Ma D', 'Sun X', 'Ji C']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Key Lab of Otolaryngology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Key Lab of Otolaryngology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150203,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzophenanthridines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Erythroid Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Threonine/metabolism']",PMC4315404,,2015/02/04 06:00,2016/01/13 06:00,['2015/02/04 06:00'],"['2014/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0116880 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-40156 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Feb 3;10(2):e0116880. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0116880. eCollection 2015.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '933301178Z (nitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It lacks sensitive and specific biomarkers. Emerging evidences have suggested that microRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of various leukemias. This paper evaluated the association between microRNA expression and prognostic outcome for CN-AML, based on the RNA/microRNA sequencing data of CN-AML patients. High let-7a-2-3p expression and low miR-188-5p expression were identified to be significantly associated with longer overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) for CN-AML, independently or in a combined way. Their prognostic values were further confirmed in European Leukemia Net (ELN) genetic categories. Also, in multivariable analysis with other known risk factors, high let-7a-2-3p and low miR-188-5p expression remained to be associated with longer OS and EFS. In addition, the prognostic value of these two microRNAs was confirmed in patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). To gain more biological insights of the underlying mechanisms, we derived the genome-wide differential gene/microRNA signatures associated with the expression of let-7a-2-3p and miR-188-5p. Several common microRNA signatures indicating favorable outcome in previous studies were up-regulated in both high let-7a-2-3p expressers and low miR-188-5p expressers, including miR-135a, miR-335 and miR-125b and all members of miR-181 family. Additionally, common up-regulated genes included FOSB, IGJ, SNORD50A and ZNF502, and FOSB was a known favorable signature in AML. These common signatures further confirmed the underlying common mechanisms for these two microRNAs value as favorable prognostic biomarkers. We concluded that high let-7a-2-3p and low miR-188-5p expression could be potentially used as favorably prognostic biomarkers independently or in a combined way in CN-AML patients, whether they received HSCT or not.","['Jinlong, Shi', 'Lin, Fu', 'Yonghui, Li', 'Li, Yu', 'Weidong, Wang']","['Jinlong S', 'Lin F', 'Yonghui L', 'Li Y', 'Weidong W']","['Medical Engineering Division, Hainan Branch, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Sanya, Hainan, China; Medical Engineering Support Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Medical Engineering Support Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150203,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",PMC4315415,,2015/02/04 06:00,2016/01/20 06:00,['2015/02/04 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0118099 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-43697 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Feb 3;10(2):e0118099. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0118099. eCollection 2015.,"['0 (MIRN188 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (mirnlet7 microRNA, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 can infect various kinds of cells; however, HTLV-1 provirus is predominantly found in peripheral CD4 T cells in vivo. Here we find that TCF1 and LEF1, two Wnt transcription factors that are specifically expressed in T cells, inhibit viral replication through antagonizing Tax functions. TCF1 and LEF1 can each interact with Tax and inhibit Tax-dependent viral expression and activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1. As a result, HTLV-1 replication is suppressed in the presence of either TCF1 or LEF1. On the other hand, T-cell activation suppresses the expression of both TCF1 and LEF1, and this suppression enables Tax to function as an activator. We analyzed the thymus of a simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1) infected Japanese macaque, and found a negative correlation between proviral load and TCF1/LEF1 expression in various T-cell subsets, supporting the idea that TCF1 and LEF1 negatively regulate HTLV-1 replication and the proliferation of infected cells. Thus, this study identified TCF1 and LEF1 as Tax antagonistic factors in vivo, a fact which may critically influence the peripheral T-cell tropism of this virus.","['Ma, Guangyong', 'Yasunaga, Jun-ichirou', 'Akari, Hirofumi', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Ma G', 'Yasunaga J', 'Akari H', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan; and.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan; and mmatsuok@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp jyasunag@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Center for Human Evolution Modeling Research, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi 484-8506, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan; and mmatsuok@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp jyasunag@virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150202,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/*physiology', 'Macaca', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'T Cell Transcription Factor 1/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology', 'Viral Load']",PMC4343127,,2015/02/04 06:00,2015/05/06 06:00,['2015/02/04 06:00'],"['2015/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1419198112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1419198112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Feb 17;112(7):2216-21. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1419198112.

To determine a role of microRNAs on the pathogenesis of the aggressive form of CLL we studied regulation of TCL1 expression in CLL by microRNAs. We identified miR-3676 as a regulator of TCL1 expression. We demonstrated that miR-3676 targets three consecutive 28-bp repeats within 3'UTR of TCL1 and showed that miR-3676 is a powerful inhibitor of TCL1. We further showed that miR-3676 expression is significantly down-regulated in four groups of CLL carrying the 11q deletions, 13q deletions, 17p deletions, or a normal karyotype compared with normal CD19(+) cord blood and peripheral blood B cells. In addition, the sequencing of 539 CLL samples revealed five germ-line mutations in six samples (1%) in miR-3676. Two of these mutations were loss-of-function mutations. Because miR-3676 is located at 17p13, only 500-kb centromeric of tumor protein p53 (Tp53), and is codeleted with Tp53, we propose that loss of miR-3676 causes high levels of TCL1 expression contributing to CLL progression.","['Balatti, Veronica', 'Rizzotto, Lara', 'Miller, Cecelia', 'Palamarchuk, Alexey', 'Fadda, Paolo', 'Pandolfo, Rosantony', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Hertlein, Erin', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Lozanski, Arletta', 'Lozanski, Gerard', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Byrd, John C', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Pekarsky, Yuri']","['Balatti V', 'Rizzotto L', 'Miller C', 'Palamarchuk A', 'Fadda P', 'Pandolfo R', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Hertlein E', 'Ruppert AS', 'Lozanski A', 'Lozanski G', 'Kipps TJ', 'Byrd JC', 'Croce CM', 'Pekarsky Y']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, and.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, and.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, and.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, and.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, and Department of Health Sciences, University ""Magna Grecia"" of Catanzaro, Catanzaro 88100, Italy; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, and carlo.croce@osumc.edu pekarsky.yuri@osumc.edu.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, and carlo.croce@osumc.edu pekarsky.yuri@osumc.edu.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM068412/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA151319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM068412/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150202,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",PMC4343115,,2015/02/04 06:00,2015/05/06 06:00,['2015/02/04 06:00'],"['2015/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1500010112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1500010112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Feb 17;112(7):2169-74. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1500010112.

The molecular switch that dictates CAM transactivation is not clearly defined. Our goal was to determine the involvement of the transcriptional modulator megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1), also known as myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A), in CAM transactivation and the underlying mechanism. We report here that compared with wild-type littermates, MKL1/MRTF-A knockout mice were more resistant to the development of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension when exposed to low oxygen pressure. Notably, CAM induction in knockout mice was significantly attenuated with a concomitant reduction of leukocyte adhesion. In cultured vascular endothelial cells, overexpression of MKL1/MRTF-A enhanced, whereas depletion of MKL1/MRTF-A dampened, hypoxia-induced CAM transactivation. In response to hypoxia, MKL1/MRTF-A formed a complex with NF-kappaB on the CAM promoters. Of interest, MKL1/MRTF-A was responsible for recruiting a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase complex to the CAM promoters. Finally, endothelial-specific silencing of ASH2 and WDR5, 2 key components of the histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase complex, ameliorated hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in mice.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the adverse clinical outcome associated with UM-CLL, total proteomes from nine UM-CLL and nine M-CLL samples were analyzed by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based mass spectrometry. Based on the expression of 3521 identified proteins, principal component analysis separated CLL samples into two groups corresponding to immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutational status. Computational analysis showed that 43 cell migration/adhesion pathways were significantly enriched by 39 differentially expressed proteins, 35 of which were expressed at significantly lower levels in UM-CLL samples. Furthermore, UM-CLL cells underexpressed proteins associated with cytoskeletal remodeling and overexpressed proteins associated with transcriptional and translational activity. Taken together, our findings indicate that UM-CLL cells are less migratory and more adhesive than M-CLL cells, resulting in their retention in lymph nodes, where they are exposed to proliferative stimuli. In keeping with this hypothesis, analysis of an extended cohort of 120 CLL patients revealed a strong and specific association between UM-CLL and lymphadenopathy. Our study illustrates the potential of total proteome analysis to elucidate pathogenetic mechanisms in cancer.","['Eagle, Gina L', 'Zhuang, Jianguo', 'Jenkins, Rosalind E', 'Till, Kathleen J', 'Jithesh, Puthen V', 'Lin, Ke', 'Johnson, Gillian G', 'Oates, Melanie', 'Park, Kevin', 'Kitteringham, Neil R', 'Pettitt, Andrew R']","['Eagle GL', 'Zhuang J', 'Jenkins RE', 'Till KJ', 'Jithesh PV', 'Lin K', 'Johnson GG', 'Oates M', 'Park K', 'Kitteringham NR', 'Pettitt AR']","['From the double daggerDepartment of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine.', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, j.zhuang@liverpool.ac.uk.', 'section signMRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, UK;', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine.', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine.', 'paragraph signRoyal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, Liverpool L7 8XP, UK.', 'paragraph signRoyal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, Liverpool L7 8XP, UK.', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine.', 'section signMRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, UK;', 'section signMRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, UK;', 'From the double daggerDepartment of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, paragraph signRoyal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, Liverpool L7 8XP, UK a.r.pettitt@liverpool.ac.uk.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150202,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,IM,"['Aged', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Chemokine CCL21/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Computational Biology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/pathology', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results']",PMC4390271,,2015/02/04 06:00,2015/12/22 06:00,['2015/02/04 06:00'],"['2015/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)33193-5 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M114.044479 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2015 Apr;14(4):933-45. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M114.044479.

Second, we combined miRNA and gene expression data to identify putative miRNA functional networks. miRNA profiling showed distinctive patterns of regulation after stimulation in leukemic versus normal B lymphocytes and identified a differential responsiveness to BCR engagement in CLL subgroups according to the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutational status and clinical outcome. The most significantly modulated miRNAs in stimulated CLL are miR-132 and miR-212. Notably, these miRNAs appeared regulated in progressive but not in stable CLL. Accordingly, gene profiling showed a significant transcriptional response to stimulation exclusively in progressive CLL. Based on these findings, we combined miRNA and gene expression data to investigate miR-132 and miR-212 candidate interactions in this CLL subgroup. Correlation analysis pointed to a link between these miRNAs and RB/E2F and TP53 cascades with proproliferative effects, as corroborated by functional analyses. Finally, basal levels of miR-132 and miR-212 were measured in an independent cohort of 20 unstimulated CLL cases and both showed lower expression in progressive compared to stable patients, suggesting an association between the expression of these molecules and disease prognosis. Overall, our results support a model involving miR-132 and miR-212 upregulation in sustaining disease progression in CLL. These miRNAs may therefore provide new valuable strategies for therapeutic intervention.","['Tavolaro, Simona', 'Colombo, Teresa', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'Fulci, Valerio', 'Ricciardi, Maria R', 'Messina, Monica', 'Bonina, Silvia', 'Brugnoletti, Fulvia', 'Marinelli, Marilisa', 'Di Maio, Valeria', 'Mauro, Francesca R', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Macino, Giuseppe', 'Foa, Robin', 'Guarini, Anna']","['Tavolaro S', 'Colombo T', 'Chiaretti S', 'Peragine N', 'Fulci V', 'Ricciardi MR', 'Messina M', 'Bonina S', 'Brugnoletti F', 'Marinelli M', 'Di Maio V', 'Mauro FR', 'Del Giudice I', 'Macino G', 'Foa R', 'Guarini A']","['Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, ""Sapienza"" University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150202,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*blood', 'Middle Aged', '*Up-Regulation']",,,2015/02/04 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2015/02/04 06:00'],"['2014/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22236 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2015 Apr;54(4):222-34. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22236.

The most common mutations found in MDS occur in genes involved in RNA splicing (including SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2) and epigenetic modification (including TET2, ASXL1, and DNMT3A). The identification of spliceosome mutations in approximately half of all patients with MDS implicates abnormalities of RNA splicing, a pathway not previously known as a target for mutation, in the MDS pathogenesis. Several regulators of signal transduction (NRAS, JAK2) and transcription factors (RUNX1, TP53) are also frequently mutated in MDS. The complex patterns of associations between gene mutations identified have revealed epistatic interactions between spliceosome components and epigenetic modifiers in MDS. The cytogenetic abnormalities found in MDS are characterized by the loss of genetic material, whereas translocations are rare. The cytogenetic deletion maps of MDS (e.g., 5q-, 7q-, 20q-) provide us with circumstantial evidence for the presence of tumor suppressor genes. It is now recognized that haploinsufficiency (a gene dosage effect) resulting from gene deletions or inactivating mutations is an important disease mechanism in MDS. Haploinsufficiency of the ribosomal protein gene RPS14 plays a critical role in the development of anemia in the 5q- syndrome, and haploinsufficiency of CUX1 is important in some patients with MDS and AML with complete or partial loss of chromosome 7. Gene expression profiling has identified key deregulated genes and pathways and new prognostic gene signatures in MDS. Recent advances in the molecular pathogenesis of MDS are leading to new biological, clinical, and therapeutic insights.","['Pellagatti, Andrea', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline']","['Pellagatti A', 'Boultwood J']","['Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150220,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', '*Cri-du-Chat Syndrome', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Haploinsufficiency', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', '*RNA Splicing', 'Ribonucleoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Spliceosomes', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Trisomy']",,,2015/02/04 06:00,2016/03/17 06:00,['2015/02/04 06:00'],"['2014/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12515 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Jul;95(1):3-15. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12515.

Frequent mutations in cytokine receptor and Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways led us to hypothesize that ETP-ALL is dependent on JAK/STAT signaling. Here we demonstrate aberrant activation of the JAK/STAT pathway in ETP-ALL blasts relative to non-ETP T-ALL. Moreover, ETP-ALL showed hyperactivation of STAT5 in response to interleukin-7, an effect that was abrogated by the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. In vivo, ruxolitinib displayed activity in 6 of 6 patient-derived murine xenograft models of ETP-ALL, with profound single-agent efficacy in 5 models. Ruxolitinib treatment decreased peripheral blast counts relative to pretreatment levels and compared with control (P < .01) in 5 of 6 ETP-ALL xenografts, with marked reduction in mean splenic blast counts (P < .01) in 6 of 6 samples. Surprisingly, both JAK/STAT pathway activation and ruxolitinib efficacy were independent of the presence of JAK/STAT pathway mutations, raising the possibility that the therapeutic potential of ruxolitinib in ETP-ALL extends beyond those cases with JAK mutations. These findings establish the preclinical in vivo efficacy of ruxolitinib in ETP-ALL, a biologically distinct subtype for which novel therapies are needed.","['Maude, Shannon L', 'Dolai, Sibasish', 'Delgado-Martin, Cristina', 'Vincent, Tiffaney', 'Robbins, Alissa', 'Selvanathan, Arthavan', 'Ryan, Theresa', 'Hall, Junior', 'Wood, Andrew C', 'Tasian, Sarah K', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Hermiston, Michelle L', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Teachey, David T']","['Maude SL', 'Dolai S', 'Delgado-Martin C', 'Vincent T', 'Robbins A', 'Selvanathan A', 'Ryan T', 'Hall J', 'Wood AC', 'Tasian SK', 'Hunger SP', 'Loh ML', 'Mullighan CG', 'Wood BL', 'Hermiston ML', 'Grupp SA', 'Lock RB', 'Teachey DT']","[""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA;"", ""Leukaemia Biology, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia;"", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, CA;"", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA;"", ""Leukaemia Biology, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia;"", ""Leukaemia Biology, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia;"", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA;"", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA;"", 'Molecular Medicine and Pathology, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand;', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA;"", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA;"", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, CA;"", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; and."", 'Division of Hematopathology, University of Washington and Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital, San Francisco, CA;"", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA;"", ""Leukaemia Biology, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia;"", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA;""]",['eng'],"['U10 CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08CA184418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA184418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA102646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024134/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1RR024134/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R56A1099301/PHS HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA128583/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA1116660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150202,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/metabolism', 'Janus Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Nitriles', 'Precursor Cells, T-Lymphoid/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult']",PMC4357583,,2015/02/04 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2015/02/04 06:00'],"['2015/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35162-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-06-580480 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Mar 12;125(11):1759-67. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-06-580480.

This study compared cognitive problems between survivors and their siblings, determined if cognitive problems decreased during recent treatment periods and identified characteristics associated with the presence of a cognitive problem in survivors. METHODS: As part of the Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a questionnaire was sent to all survivors, aged 8-20 years, registered in the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, diagnosed at age <16 years, who had survived >/= 5 years. Parent-reported (aged 8-15 years) and self-reported (aged 16-20 years) cognitive problems (concentration, working speed, memory) were compared between survivors and siblings. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify characteristics associated with cognitive problems in survivors. RESULTS: Data from 840 survivors and 247 siblings were analyzed. More often than their siblings, survivors reported problems with concentration (12% vs. 6%; P = 0.020), slow working speed (20% vs. 8%; P = 0.001) or memory (33% vs. 15%; P < 0.001). Survivors from all treatment periods were more likely to report a cognitive problem than were siblings. Survivors of CNS tumors (OR = 2.82 compared to leukemia survivors, P < 0.001) and those who had received cranial irradiation (OR = 2.10, P = 0.010) were most severely affected. CONCLUSION: Childhood cancer survivors, even those treated recently (2001-2005), remain at risk to develop cognitive problems, suggesting a need to improve therapies. Survivors with cognitive problems should be given the opportunity to enter special education programs.","['Wengenroth, L', 'Rueegg, C S', 'Michel, G', 'Gianinazzi, M E', 'Essig, S', 'von der Weid, N X', 'Grotzer, M', 'Kuehni, Claudia E']","['Wengenroth L', 'Rueegg CS', 'Michel G', 'Gianinazzi ME', 'Essig S', 'von der Weid NX', 'Grotzer M', 'Kuehni CE']","['Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['133897/Swiss National Science Foundation/Switzerland'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150202,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Attention/physiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Mental Processes/physiology', 'Neoplasms/*complications/psychology/therapy', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', '*Siblings', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Switzerland/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC5916869,['EMS77294'],2015/02/04 06:00,2015/07/08 06:00,['2015/02/04 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25396 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 May;62(5):875-82. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25396.

An important treatment option is the use of high-dose corticosteroids. The purpose of this clinical trial was to determine the efficacy and toxicity of an ofatumumab-dexamethasone (O-Dex) combination in relapsed or refractory CLL. The trial was an open-label, multicenter, nonrandomized, Phase II study. The O-Dex regimen consisted of intravenous ofatumumab (Cycle 1: 300 mg on day 1, 2,000 mg on days 8, 15, and 22; Cycles 2-6: 1,000 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22) and oral dexamethasone (40 mg on days 1-4 and 15-18; Cycles 1-6). The O-Dex regimen was given until best response, or a maximum of six cycles. Thirty-three patients (pts) were recruited. Twenty-four (73%) pts completed at least three cycles of therapy. The remaining nine pts were prematurely discontinued owing to Grade 3/4 infections (seven pts), disease progression (one pt), or uncontrollable diabetes mellitus (one pt). Overall response rates/complete remissions (ORR/CR) were achieved in 22/5 pts (67/15%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10 months. In pts with p53 defects (n = 8), ORR/CR were achieved in 5/2 pts (63/25%) with a median PFS of 10.5 months. The median overall survival (OS) was 34 months. The Grades 3-5 infectious toxicity in 33% of pts represented the most frequent side effect during the treatment period. In conclusion, the O-Dex regimen shows a relatively high ORR and CR with promising findings for PFS and OS.

These results indicate that the activity of VGSCs could represent a novel mechanism potentiating the invasive capacity of these cells.","['Huang, Weifeng', 'Lu, Chunjing', 'Wu, Yong', 'Ouyang, Shou', 'Chen, Yuanzhong']","['Huang W', 'Lu C', 'Wu Y', 'Ouyang S', 'Chen Y']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350004, PR China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Xiamen, Xiamen 361003, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350004, PR China.', 'Xiamen Medical Research Institute, Xiamen 361008, PR China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350004, PR China.

Despite the fact that tyrosine kinase inhibitors have established targeted molecular therapy in CML, patients often face the risk of developing drug resistance, caused by mutations and/or activation of alternative cellular pathways. To optimize drug development, one needs to systematically test all possible combinations of drug targets within the genetic network that regulates the disease. The BioModelAnalyzer (BMA) is a user-friendly computational tool that allows us to do exactly that. We used BMA to build a CML network-model composed of 54 nodes linked by 104 interactions that encapsulates experimental data collected from 160 publications. While previous studies were limited by their focus on a single pathway or cellular process, our executable model allowed us to probe dynamic interactions between multiple pathways and cellular outcomes, suggest new combinatorial therapeutic targets, and highlight previously unexplored sensitivities to Interleukin-3.","['Chuang, Ryan', 'Hall, Benjamin A', 'Benque, David', 'Cook, Byron', 'Ishtiaq, Samin', 'Piterman, Nir', 'Taylor, Alex', 'Vardi, Moshe', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Fisher, Jasmin']","['Chuang R', 'Hall BA', 'Benque D', 'Cook B', 'Ishtiaq S', 'Piterman N', 'Taylor A', 'Vardi M', 'Koschmieder S', 'Gottgens B', 'Fisher J']","['Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 0WA, UK.', '1] Microsoft Research, Cambridge CB1 2FB, UK [2] MRC Cancer Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0XZ, UK.', 'Microsoft Research, Cambridge CB1 2FB, UK.', '1] Microsoft Research, Cambridge CB1 2FB, UK [2] Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, WC1E 6BT, UK.', 'Microsoft Research, Cambridge CB1 2FB, UK.', 'Department of Computer Science, University of Leicester, Leicester, LE1 7RH, UK.', 'Microsoft Research, Cambridge CB1 2FB, UK.', 'Department of Computer Science, Rice University, Huston 77005-1892, Texas.', 'Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Aachen, Aachen D-52074, Germany.', '1] Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK [2] Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK.', '1] Microsoft Research, Cambridge CB1 2FB, UK [2] Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1GA, UK.']",['eng'],"['12765/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12022/9/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150203,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Computer Simulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4650822,,2015/02/04 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/04 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['srep08190 [pii]', '10.1038/srep08190 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Feb 3;5:8190. doi: 10.1038/srep08190.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To reduce the risk of relapse, we prospectively studied post-transplantation chimerism-based immunotherapy (IT) using fast withdrawal of immunosuppression (FWI) and donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) in children with early post-transplantation MC. Forty-three children with hematologic malignancies at 2 institutions were enrolled prospectively in this study from 2009 until 2012 and were followed for a mean of 42 (SD, 10) months. Twelve patients (28%) were assigned to the observation arm based on the presence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or full donor chimerism (FDC), and 5 (12%) sustained early events and could not undergo intervention. Twenty-six (60%) patients with MC were assigned to IT with FWI, which started at a median of 49 days (range, 35 to 85 days) after transplantation. Fourteen patients proceeded to DLI after FWI. Toxicities of treatment included GVHD, which developed in 19% of patients undergoing intervention, with 1 of 26 (4%) dying from GVHD and 1 (4%) still requiring therapy for chronic GVHD 21 months after DLI. Patients with MC undergoing IT had similar 2-year event-free survival (EFS) (73%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 55% to 91%) compared with patients who achieved FDC spontaneously (83%; 95% CI, 62% to 100%); however, because 50% of all relapses in the IT occurred later than 2 years after transplantation, the EFS declined to 55% (95% CI, 34% to 76%) at 42 (SD, 11) months. There were no late relapses in the observation group. EFS in the entire cohort was 58% (95% CI, 42% to 73%) at 42 (SD, 11) months after transplantation. Evidence of disease before transplantation remained a significant predictor of relapse, whereas development of chronic GVHD was protective against relapse.","['Horn, Biljana', 'Petrovic, Aleksandra', 'Wahlstrom, Justin', 'Dvorak, Christopher C', 'Kong, Denice', 'Hwang, Jimmy', 'Expose-Spencer, Jueleah', 'Gates, Michael', 'Cowan, Morton J']","['Horn B', 'Petrovic A', 'Wahlstrom J', 'Dvorak CC', 'Kong D', 'Hwang J', 'Expose-Spencer J', 'Gates M', 'Cowan MJ']","[""Allergy Immunology and Blood and Marrow Transplant Division at Benioff Children's Hospital at University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.

METHODS: Participants were twenty-two 7-12-year survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 20 age-matched controls. RSA was calculated from cardiac interbeat interval using spectral time-series analysis. t-Scores on the Child Behavior Checklist Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn/Depressed, and Somatic Complaints subscales were computed. RESULTS: Respiratory sinus arrhythmia moderated the relation between diagnostic status and both child somatic complaints and withdrawn/depressed symptoms. The positive association between diagnostic status and somatic complaints was significant for children with low RSA but not significant for children with high RSA. This association was also significant for withdrawn/depressed symptoms. Low RSA was associated with more somatic complaints and withdrawn/depressed symptoms for children with cancer but not for control participants. CONCLUSIONS: Children who have poor emotion regulation abilities may be more vulnerable to the range of stressors associated with the diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship of cancer. Behavioral interventions targeting emotion regulation skills may reduce internalizing symptoms in this population.","['Katz, Lynn Fainsilber', 'Heleniak, Charlotte', 'Kawamura, Joy', 'Jakubiak, Jessica']","['Katz LF', 'Heleniak C', 'Kawamura J', 'Jakubiak J']","['Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150202,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,IM,"['Anxiety', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Depression', '*Emotional Intelligence', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology/therapy', '*Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Somatoform Disorders/*psychology', 'Survivors/*psychology/statistics & numerical data']",,,2015/02/04 06:00,2017/02/02 06:00,['2015/02/04 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3762 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2015 Nov;24(11):1536-44. doi: 10.1002/pon.3762.

However, they are just emerging as a model for human brain tumors, which are among the most devastating and difficult to treat. In this study, we evaluated zebrafish as a brain tumor model by overexpressing a human version of oncogenic KRAS (KRAS(G12V)). METHODS: Using zebrafish cytokeratin 5 (krt5) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) gene promoters, we activated Ras signaling in the zebrafish central nervous system (CNS) through transient and stable transgenic overexpression. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to identify activated pathways in the resulting brain tumors. The effects of the MEK inhibitor U0126 on oncogenic KRAS were evaluated. RESULTS: We demonstrated that transient transgenic expression of KRAS(G12V) in putative neural stem and/or progenitor cells induced brain tumorigenesis. When expressed under the control of the krt5 gene promoter, KRAS(G12V) induced brain tumors in ventricular zones (VZ) at low frequency. The majority of other tumors were composed mostly of spindle and epithelioid cells, reminiscent of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). In contrast, when expressed under the control of the gfap gene promoter, KRAS(G12V) induced brain tumors in both VZs and brain parenchyma at higher frequency. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated prominent activation of the canonical RAS-RAF-ERK pathway, variable activation of the mTOR pathway, but no activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. In a krt5-derived stable and inducible transgenic line, expression of oncogenic KRAS resulted in skin hyperplasia, and the MEK inhibitor U0126 effectively suppressed this pro-proliferative effects. In a gfap-derived stable and inducible line, expression of oncogenic KRAS led to significantly increased mitotic index in the spinal cord. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate that zebrafish could be explored to study cellular origins and molecular mechanisms of brain tumorigenesis and could also be used as a platform for studying human oncogene function and for discovering oncogenic RAS inhibitors.","['Ju, Bensheng', 'Chen, Wenbiao', 'Orr, Brent A', 'Spitsbergen, Jan M', 'Jia, Sujuan', 'Eden, Christopher J', 'Henson, Hannah E', 'Taylor, Michael R']","['Ju B', 'Chen W', 'Orr BA', 'Spitsbergen JM', 'Jia S', 'Eden CJ', 'Henson HE', 'Taylor MR']","[""Department of Chemical Biology & Therapeutics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA. bensheng.ju@stjude.org."", 'Department of Molecular Physiology & Biophysics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA. wenbiao.chen@vanderbilt.edu.', ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA. brent.orr@stjude.org."", 'Fish Disease Research Group, Department of Microbiology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, 97331, USA. spitsbej@onid.orst.edu.', ""Department of Chemical Biology & Therapeutics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA. sujuan.jia@stjude.org."", ""Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA. ceden@nikon.net."", ""Department of Chemical Biology & Therapeutics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA. hannah.henson@uky.edu."", 'Integrated Program in Biomedical Sciences, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, 38163, USA. hannah.henson@uky.edu.', ""Department of Chemical Biology & Therapeutics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA. michael.taylor@wisc.edu."", 'Current address: Pharmaceutical Sciences Division, School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, 53705, USA. michael.taylor@wisc.edu.']",['eng'],['R01 DK088686/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150203,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Brain/metabolism/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Keratin-5/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Transgenes', 'Zebrafish', 'ras Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC4320811,,2015/02/04 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2015/02/04 06:00'],"['2014/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12943-015-0288-2 [doi]', 's12943-015-0288-2 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2015 Feb 3;14:18. doi: 10.1186/s12943-015-0288-2.,"['0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Keratin-5)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The substantially high treatment cost has unfortunately been a major issue, which puts a strain on health-care budgets even in developed countries. So reimbursement policies encourage generic drug (i.e. generic imatinib) use to lower the expenses, and it is true that generics would lead to considerable cost savings, but they also give rise to questions associated with their efficacy, safety and quality.

B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders and is the commonest leukaemia type in the Western world. In this study, we have investigated the pathobiological functions of the ID2 and ID3 proteins in this disease with an emphasis on their role in regulating leukemic cell death/survival. METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis of microarray gene expression data was used to investigate expression of ID2/ID3 in leukemic versus normal B cells, their association with clinical course of disease and molecular sub-type and to reconstruct a gene regulatory network using the 'maximum information coefficient' (MIC) for target gene inference. In vitro cultured primary leukemia cells, either in isolation or co-cultured with accessory vascular endothelial cells, were used to investigate ID2/ID3 protein expression by western blotting and to assess the cytotoxic response of different drugs (fludarabine, chlorambucil, ethacrynic acid) by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. ID2/ID3 protein levels in primary leukemia cells and in MEC1 cells were manipulated by transduction with siRNA reagents. RESULTS: Datamining showed that the expression profiles of ID2 and ID3 are associated with distinct pathobiological features of disease and implicated both genes in regulating cell death/survival by targeting multiple non-overlapping sets of apoptosis effecter genes. Consistent with microarray data, the overall pattern of ID2/ID3 protein expression in relation to cell death/survival responses of primary leukemia cells was suggestive of a pro-survival function for both ID proteins. This was confirmed by siRNA knock-down experiments in MEC1 cells and in primary leukemia cells, but with variability in the dependence of leukemic cells from different patients on ID protein expression for cell survival. Vascular endothelial cells rescued leukemia cells from spontaneous and cytotoxic drug-induced cell death at least in part, via an ID protein-coupled redox-dependent mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence for a pro-survival function of the ID2/ID3 proteins in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and also highlights these proteins as potential determinants of the pathobiology of this disorder.","['Weiler, Sarah', 'Ademokun, Jolaolu A', 'Norton, John D']","['Weiler S', 'Ademokun JA', 'Norton JD']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester, Essex, CO4 3SQ, UK.

However, the roles of KLF4 in hematological malignancies and the mechanisms of action are not fully understood. METHODS: Inducible KLF4-overexpression Jurkat cell line combined with mouse models bearing cell-derived xenografts and primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells from four patients were used to assess the functional role of KLF4 in T-ALL cells in vitro and in vivo. A genome-wide RNA-seq analysis was conducted to identify genes regulated by KLF4 in T-ALL cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) PCR was used to determine direct binding sites of KLF4 in T-ALL cells. RESULTS: Here we reveal that KLF4 induced apoptosis through the BCL2/BCLXL pathway in human T-ALL cell lines and primary T-ALL specimens. In consistence, mice engrafted with KLF4-overexpressing T-ALL cells exhibited prolonged survival. Interestingly, the KLF4-induced apoptosis in T-ALL cells was compromised in xenografts but the invasion capacity of KLF4-expressing T-ALL cells to hosts was dramatically dampened. We found that KLF4 overexpression inhibited T cell-associated genes including NOTCH1, BCL11B, GATA3, and TCF7. Further mechanistic studies revealed that KLF4 directly bound to the promoters of NOTCH1, BCL2, and CXCR4 and suppressed their expression. Additionally, KLF4 induced SUMOylation and degradation of BCL11B. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that KLF4 as a major transcription factor that suppresses the expression of T-cell associated genes, thus inhibiting T-ALL progression.","['Li, Wei', 'Jiang, Zhiwu',

Recent novel findings have indicated that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which have the potential to self-renew and differentiate into multilineage hematopoietic cells, are an important cellular target for the accumulation of critical somatic mutations in hematological malignancies and play a central role in myeloid malignancy development. In contrast to myeloid malignancies, mature lymphoid malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), are thought to originate directly from differentiated mature lymphocytes; however, recent compelling data have shown that primitive HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells contribute to the pathogenesis of mature lymphoid malignancies. Several representative mutations of hematological malignancies have been identified within the HSCs of CLL and lymphoma patients, indicating that the self-renewing long-lived fraction of HSCs can serve as a reservoir for the development of oncogenic events. Novel mice models have been established as human mature lymphoma models, in which specific oncogenic events target the HSCs and immature progenitor cells. These data collectively suggest that HSCs can be the cellular target involved in the accumulation of oncogenic events in the pathogenesis of mature lymphoid and myeloid malignancies.","['Kikushige, Yoshikane', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro']","['Kikushige Y', 'Miyamoto T']","['Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Sciences, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-Ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan.', 'Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Sciences, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-Ku, Fukuoka, 812-8582, Japan. toshmiya@intmed1.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150203,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology']",,,2015/02/04 06:00,2016/10/07 06:00,['2015/02/04 06:00'],"['2014/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-015-1740-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-015-1740-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Nov;102(5):528-35. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1740-1.

PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling also plays an important role in cell metabolism. The Warburg effect is a well-recognized hallmark of cancer energy metabolism, and is regulated by the mTOR/c-Myc/hnRNP/PKM signaling cascade. To develop a new strategy for the treatment of CML, we investigated the associations among bcr-abl, the cascade related to cancer energy metabolism, and autophagy induced by a fatty-acid derivative that we had previously reported as being an autophagy inducer. Here we report that a fatty-acid derivative, AIC-47, induced transcriptional repression of the bcr-abl gene and modulated the expression profile of PKM isoforms, resulting in autophagic cell death. We show that c-Myc functioned as a transcriptional activator of bcr-abl, and regulated the hnRNP/PKM cascade. AIC-47, acting through the PPARgamma/beta-catenin pathway, induced down-regulation of c-Myc, leading to the disruption of the bcr-abl/mTOR/hnRNP signaling pathway, and switching of the expression of PKM2 to PKM1. This switching caused autophagic cell death through an increase in the ROS level. Our findings suggest that AIC-47 induced autophagic cell death through the PPARgamma/beta-catenin/bcr-abl/mTOR/hnRNP/PKM cascade.","['Shinohara, Haruka', 'Taniguchi, Kohei', 'Kumazaki, Minami', 'Yamada, Nami', 'Ito, Yuko', 'Otsuki, Yoshinori', 'Uno, Bunji', 'Hayakawa, Fumihiko', 'Minami, Yosuke', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Akao, Yukihiro']","['Shinohara H', 'Taniguchi K', 'Kumazaki M', 'Yamada N', 'Ito Y', 'Otsuki Y', 'Uno B', 'Hayakawa F', 'Minami Y', 'Naoe T', 'Akao Y']","['United Graduate School of Drug Discovery and Medical Information Sciences, Gifu University, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 501-1193, Japan.', 'United Graduate School of Drug Discovery and Medical Information Sciences, Gifu University, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 501-1193, Japan.', 'United Graduate School of Drug Discovery and Medical Information Sciences, Gifu University, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 501-1193, Japan.', 'United Graduate School of Drug Discovery and Medical Information Sciences, Gifu University, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 501-1193, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy and Biology, Osaka Medical College, 2-7 Daigaku-machi, Takatsuki, Osaka 596-8686, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy and Biology, Osaka Medical College, 2-7 Daigaku-machi, Takatsuki, Osaka 596-8686, Japan.', 'Gifu Pharmaceutical University, 1-25-4 Daigaku-nishi, Gifu 501-1196, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate school of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.', 'Division of Blood Transfusion/Division of Oncology and Hematology, Kobe University Hospital, 7-5-2 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, 4-1-1 Sannomaru, Nagoya, 460-0001, Japan.', 'United Graduate School of Drug Discovery and Medical Information Sciences, Gifu University, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 501-1193, Japan.

Consequently, BCR-ABL causes increased proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and altered adhesion of leukemic blasts to the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. It has been well documented that cancer cells can generate their own signals in order to sustain their growth and survival, and recent studies have revealed the role of cancer-derived exosomes in activating signal transduction pathways involved in cancer cell proliferation. Exosomes are small vesicles of 40-100 nm in diameter that are initially formed within the endosomal compartment, and are secreted when a multivesicular body (MVB) fuses with the plasma membrane. These vesicles are released by many cell types including cancer cells, and are considered messengers in intercellular communication. We have previously shown that CML cells released exosomes able to affect the tumor microenvironment. RESULTS: CML cells, exposed up to one week, to exosomes showed a dose-dependent increased proliferation compared with controls. Moreover, exosome treatment promotes the formation of LAMA84 colonies in methylcellulose. In a CML xenograft model, treatment of mice with exosomes caused a greater increase in tumor size compared with controls (PBS-treated mice). Real time PCR and Western Blot analysis showed, in both in vitro and in vivo samples, an increase in mRNA and protein levels of anti-apoptotic molecules, such as BCL-w, BCL-xl, and survivin, and a reduction of the pro-apoptotic molecules BAD, BAX and PUMA. We also found that TGF- beta1 was enriched in CML-exosomes. Our investigations showed that exosome-stimulated proliferation of leukemia cells, as well as the exosome-mediated activation of an anti-apoptotic phenotype, can be inhibited by blocking TGF-beta1 signaling. CONCLUSIONS: CML-derived exosomes promote, through an autocrine mechanism, the proliferation and survival of tumor cells, both in vitro and in vivo, by activating anti-apoptotic pathways. We propose that this mechanism is activated by a ligand-receptor interaction between TGF-beta1, found in CML-derived exosomes, and the TGF- beta1 receptor in CML cells.","['Raimondo, Stefania', 'Saieva, Laura', 'Corrado, Chiara', 'Fontana, Simona', 'Flugy, Anna', 'Rizzo, Aroldo', 'De Leo, Giacomo', 'Alessandro, Riccardo']","['Raimondo S', 'Saieva L', 'Corrado C', 'Fontana S', 'Flugy A', 'Rizzo A', 'De Leo G', 'Alessandro R']","['Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Biotecnologie Mediche e Forensi, Universita degli studi di Palermo, sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Via Divisi 83, 90100, Palermo, Italy. stefania.raimondo@unipa.it.', 'Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Biotecnologie Mediche e Forensi, Universita degli studi di Palermo, sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Via Divisi 83, 90100, Palermo, Italy. laurasaieva@gmail.com.', 'Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Biotecnologie Mediche e Forensi, Universita degli studi di Palermo, sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Via Divisi 83, 90100, Palermo, Italy. chiara.corrado@unipa.it.', 'Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Biotecnologie Mediche e Forensi, Universita degli studi di Palermo, sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Via Divisi 83, 90100, Palermo, Italy. simona.fontana@unipa.it.', 'Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Biotecnologie Mediche e Forensi, Universita degli studi di Palermo, sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Via Divisi 83, 90100, Palermo, Italy. anna.flugy@unipa.it.', 'Azienda Ospedaliera Ospedali Riuniti Villa Sofia- Cervello, Anatomia Patologica, Palermo, Italy. aroldorizzo@yahoo.it.', 'Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Biotecnologie Mediche e Forensi, Universita degli studi di Palermo, sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Via Divisi 83, 90100, Palermo, Italy. giacomo.deleo@unipa.it.', 'Dipartimento di Biopatologia e Biotecnologie Mediche e Forensi, Universita degli studi di Palermo, sezione di Biologia e Genetica, Via Divisi 83, 90100, Palermo, Italy. riccardo.alessandro@unipa.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150203,England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Exosomes/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Survivin', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4320527,,2015/02/04 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2015/02/04 06:00'],"['2014/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12964-015-0086-x [doi]', 's12964-015-0086-x [pii]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2015 Feb 3;13:8. doi: 10.1186/s12964-015-0086-x.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, flubendazole was tested for its effects on the viability of in total 461 cancer cell lines. Neuroblastoma was identified as highly flubendazole-sensitive cancer entity in a screen of 321 cell lines from 26 cancer entities. Flubendazole also reduced the viability of five primary neuroblastoma samples in nanomolar concentrations thought to be achievable in humans and inhibited vessel formation and neuroblastoma tumour growth in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Resistance acquisition is a major problem in high-risk neuroblastoma. 119 cell lines from a panel of 140 neuroblastoma cell lines with acquired resistance to various anti-cancer drugs were sensitive to flubendazole in nanomolar concentrations. Tubulin-binding agent-resistant cell lines displayed the highest flubendazole IC50 and IC90 values but differences between drug classes did not reach statistical significance. Flubendazole induced p53-mediated apoptosis. The siRNA-mediated depletion of the p53 targets p21, BAX, or PUMA reduced the neuroblastoma cell sensitivity to flubendazole with PUMA depletion resulting in the most pronounced effects. The MDM2 inhibitor and p53 activator nutlin-3 increased flubendazole efficacy while RNAi-mediated p53-depletion reduced its activity. In conclusion, flubendazole represents a potential treatment option for neuroblastoma including therapy-refractory cells.","['Michaelis, Martin', 'Agha, Bishr', 'Rothweiler, Florian', 'Loschmann,

Eligibility included AML in first complete remission (CR1) with adverse risk karyotype (n = 8), fms-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) (n = 5), age >/=60 years (n = 31) or AML in second remission (CR2) (n = 14). Dose-limiting toxicity was not reached. Common toxicities were haematological, infection, injection pain, constipation, fatigue and diarrhoea. In CR1, median relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) was 12 and 20 months, respectively. In CR2, median RFS was 11 months, with median OS not yet reached. Among 29 patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk, RFS was 50% at 24 months. There were five patients with concomitant FLT3-ITD and nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutation; none have relapsed and all are still alive after 17-39 months. Maintenance lenalidomide/azacitidine augmented the function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, particularly in patients with NPM1 mutation. The lenalidomide/azacitidine maintenance combination was effective in suppressing residual DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A)-positive disease, resulting in sustained remission in patients with concurrent NPM1 mutation.

In this study, we demonstrated that PHA-767491, a dual inhibitor of two cell cycle checkpoint kinases, cell division cycle kinase 7 (Cdc7) and cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9), has synergistic antitumor effect with 5-FU to suppress human HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Compared with the sole use of each agent, PHA-767491 in combination with 5-FU exhibited much stronger cytotoxicity and induced significant apoptosis manifested by remarkably increased caspase 3 activation and poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase fragmentation in HCC cells. PHA-767491 directly counteracted the 5-FU-induced phosphorylation of Chk1, a substrate of Cdc7; and decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein myeloid leukemia cell 1, a downstream target of Cdk9. In tumor tissues sectioned from nude mice HCC xenografts, administration of PHA-767491 also decreased Chk1 phosphorylation and increased in situ cell apoptosis. Our study suggests that PHA- 767491 could enhance the efficacy of 5-FU by inhibiting Chk1 phosphorylation and down-regulating Mcl1 expression through inhibition of Cdc7 and Cdk9, thus combinational administration of PHA-767491 with 5-FU could be potentially beneficial to patients with advanced and resistant HCC.","['Li, Wei', 'Zhao, Xiao-Le', 'Shang, Shi-Qiang', 'Shen, Hong-Qiang', 'Chen, Xi']","['Li W', 'Zhao XL', 'Shang SQ', 'Shen HQ', 'Chen X']","['No. 57 Zhu Gan Xiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, China. chchenxi@zju.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperidones/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2015/02/03 06:00,2016/02/18 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2014/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['CCDT-EPUB-64925 [pii]', '10.2174/1568009615666150212112753 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2015;15(3):196-204. doi: 10.2174/1568009615666150212112753.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PHA 767491)', '0 (Piperidones)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrroles)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (CDC7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we determined that compared with thymic and peripheral T cells, T-ALL cells from patients have elevated levels of IRAK1 and IRAK4 mRNA as well as increased total and phosphorylated protein. Targeted inhibition of IRAK1 and IRAK4, either with shRNA or with a pharmacological IRAK1/4 inhibitor, dramatically impeded proliferation of T-ALL cells isolated from patients and T-ALL cells in a murine leukemia model; however, IRAK1/4 inhibition had little effect on cell death. We screened several hundred FDA-approved compounds and identified a set of drugs that had enhanced cytotoxic activity when combined with IRAK inhibition. Administration of an IRAK1/4 inhibitor or IRAK knockdown in combination with either ABT-737 or vincristine markedly reduced leukemia burden in mice and prolonged survival. IRAK1/4 signaling activated the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, increasing K63-linked ubiquitination and enhancing stability of the antiapoptotic protein MCL1; therefore, IRAK inhibition reduced MCL1 stability and sensitized T-ALL to combination therapy. These studies demonstrate that IRAK1/4 signaling promotes T-ALL progression through stabilization of MCL1 and suggest that impeding this pathway has potential as a therapeutic strategy to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy.","['Li, Zhaoyang', 'Younger, Kenisha', 'Gartenhaus, Ronald', 'Joseph, Ann Mary', 'Hu, Fang', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Brown, Patrick', 'Davila, Eduardo']","['Li Z', 'Younger K', 'Gartenhaus R', 'Joseph AM', 'Hu F', 'Baer MR', 'Brown P', 'Davila E']",,['eng'],"['I01 BX002990/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R01 CA140917/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA140917/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150202,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Protein Stability', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6/metabolism', 'Vincristine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4362243,,2015/02/03 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2014/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['75821 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI75821 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2015 Mar 2;125(3):1081-97. doi: 10.1172/JCI75821.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies provide valuable insights into the management of chronic diseases such as CP-CML. RCTs are undoubtedly the backbone of clinical research, and the 'gold standard' for evaluating the efficacy and safety of new therapies. However, many questions surrounding the optimal management of patients with CML remain unanswered, and it is widely accepted that these questions will be best answered by evaluating the use of available therapies in clinical practice. Observational studies can extend the knowledge base beyond the clinical trial setting and thus capture a more accurate picture of everyday clinical practice, particularly patients' experiences of long-term CML treatment. There is therefore growing interest in and appreciation of the value of observational research. This review article will examine the relative merits of RCTs and observational studies in the setting of CML, highlighting those factors - such as the advancing age of the CML patient population and growing importance of patient-reported outcomes - that mean that observational studies should play an important role in shaping clinical practice. This article also provides an overview of what observational studies have told us thus far about the optimal management of patients with CML, outlines some of the key remaining unanswered clinical questions in CML, and summarizes ongoing observational studies designed to provide answers to these key questions.","['Mauro, Michael J', 'Davis, Catherine', 'Zyczynski, Teresa', 'Khoury, H Jean']","['Mauro MJ', 'Davis C', 'Zyczynski T', 'Khoury HJ']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 489, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Oncology, Global Health Outcomes, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb, Oncology, Global Health Outcomes, Princeton, NJ, USA.', 'Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,PMC4298489,,2015/02/03 06:00,2015/02/03 06:01,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620714560305 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620714560305 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2015 Feb;6(1):3-14. doi: 10.1177/2040620714560305.,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'dasatinib', 'imatinib', 'nilotinib', 'observational study']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also useful in the consolidation/maintenance phase of treatment. Many trials are ongoing to determine the best and optimum schedule for this drug as a single agent or in combination with other drugs. In the future, its indications might extend to other malignancies.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is persistently secreted from myeloid cells and high levels can be detected in patients' serum. METHODS: Twenty-one AML patients, who were chemotherapy candidates were evaluated in a clinical trial. Serum VEGF was measured by ELISA. VEGFA, VEGFC mRNA and bone marrow MVD were measured in all patients before and after chemotherapy and then all results were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 10 (48%) female and 11(52%) male patients ranged in age from 20 to 60 years, with an average age of 39.5 +/-14.1 years. The mean amount of MVD was reduced from 10.8+/-3.6 before chemotherapy to7.6+/-3.3 after chemotherapy (P=0.008). VEGF was also reduced from 0.59+/-0.16 before chemotherapy to 0.24+/-0.03 after chemotherapy (P=0.005). Gene expression differences for VEGFA mRNA was 4.6+/-1.4, while it was 120.7+/-93.2 for VEGFC mRNA, showing the significance only for VEGA mRNA (P=0.02).

To date, assessment of thyroid function during imatinib therapy has limited to retrospective studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of imatinib on thyroid function in a prospective manner. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 16 newly diagnosed adult subjects with positive Philadelphia chromosome in chronic phase of CML without any other apparent underlying diseases were enrolled. Free T3, Free T4, TSH, Anti TPO and Anti thyroglobulin antibodies were measured before and after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Of the 16 patients, 9 were male (57.1%) and 7(42.9%) were female with a mean age of 29+/-5 years. There were statistically significant changes within reference ranges in serum concentrations of TSH (P=0.753 and 0.002), Free T3 (P=0.012 and 0.007) and Anti Thyroglobulin (P=0.221 and 0.041) 1 month before and 3 months after imatinib initiation, respectively. At the same time, there were no significant changes in serum Free T4 (P=0.196 and 0.650) and Anti TPO (P=0.807 and 0.600) concentrations. CONCLUSION: This study showed some significant changes on thyroid function tests during imatinib therapy. However, all of them were within the normal range without any clinical abnormalities in the course of treatment.

This historical cohort study included adult patients (>/= 15 years old) with AML (n=363) who received allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from HLA-identical sibling donors in the first or higher complete remission following myeloablative conditioning regimens between 2004 and 2011.The patients recruited in this study were followed-up until January 2013. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) were excluded from the study. Early outcomes until day +100 and events after day +100 were regarded for acute and chronic GVHD, respectively. A multi state model for competing risks was applied. We found that the EBMT risk score was a good predictor for overall survival (OS) and relapse incidence; however, it was not associated with transplant-related mortality (TRM). The EBMT risk score was not associated with acute and chronic GVHD. For early outcomes, the predictive effect of the EBMT risk score was not statistically significant in the presence of acute GVHD; however, in the presence of chronic GVHD, it was a significant predictor of relapse but not for TRM. It seems that the effect of EBMT risk score on OS and relapse incidence cannot be affected by GVHD. Although the results were insignificant, there was evidence that the EBMT risk score can predict early outcomes, while for late outcomes, it works well for relapse and OS but not for TRM.","['Jalali, Arash', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Mahmoudi, Mahmood', 'Mohammad, Kazem', 'Zeraati, Hojjat', 'Mousavi, Seied Asadollah', 'Bahar, Babak', 'Vaezi, Mohammad', 'Jahani, Mohammad', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Jalali A', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Mahmoudi M', 'Mohammad K', 'Zeraati H', 'Mousavi SA', 'Bahar B', 'Vaezi M', 'Jahani M', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran ; Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,PMC4305375,,2015/02/03 06:00,2015/02/03 06:01,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2014/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/03 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2014 Jul 1;8(3):1-11.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Competing risks', 'Graft versus host disease', 'Multistate model', 'Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation', 'Survival analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated a role of imatinib immediately before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Children with Ph(+) ALL were enrolled on JPLSG Ph(+) ALL 04 Study within 1 week of initiation of treatment for ALL. Treatment regimen consisted of Induction phase, Consolidation phase, Reinduction phase, 2 weeks of imatinib monotherapy phase, and HSCT phase (Etoposide+CY+TBI conditioning). Minimal residual disease (MRD), the amount of BCR-ABL transcripts, was measured with the real-time PCR method. The study was registered in UMIN-CTR: UMIN ID C000000290. Forty-two patients were registered and 36 patients (86%) achieved complete remission (CR). Eight of 17 patients (47%) who had detectable MRD at the beginning of imatinib monotherapy phase showed disappearance or decrease in MRD after imatinib treatment. Consequently, 26 patients received HSCT in the first CR and all the patients had engraftment and no patients died because of complications of HSCT. The 4-year event-free survival rates and overall survival rates among all the 42 patients were 54.1 +/- 7.8% and 78.1 +/- 6.5%, respectively. Four of six patients who did achieve CR and three of six who relapsed before HSCT were salvaged with imatinib-containing chemotherapy and subsequently treated with HSCT. The survival rate was excellent in this study although all patients received HSCT. A longer use of imatinib concurrently with chemotherapy should eliminate HSCT in a subset of patients with a rapid clearance of the disease.","['Manabe, Atsushi', 'Kawasaki, Hirohide', 'Shimada, Hiroyuki', 'Kato, Itaru', 'Kodama, Yuichi', 'Sato, Atsushi', 'Matsumoto, Kimikazu', 'Kato, Keisuke', 'Yabe, Hiromasa', 'Kudo, Kazuko', 'Kato, Motohiro', 'Saito, Tomohiro', 'Saito, Akiko M', 'Tsurusawa, Masahito', 'Horibe, Keizo']","['Manabe A', 'Kawasaki H', 'Shimada H', 'Kato I', 'Kodama Y', 'Sato A', 'Matsumoto K', 'Kato K', 'Yabe H', 'Kudo K', 'Kato M', 'Saito T', 'Saito AM', 'Tsurusawa M', 'Horibe K']","[""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University Hirakata Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Miyagi Children's Hospital, Miyagi, Japan."", 'National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Mito, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Tokai University, Isehara, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shizuoka Children's Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'MPH Department of Health Policy, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'MPH Laboratory of Clinical, Epidemiological and Health services Research, Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization, Nagoya Medical Center, Aichi, Japan.', 'Deprtment of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University, Nagakute, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150131,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4430261,,2015/02/03 06:00,2016/02/03 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2014/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cam4.383 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2015 May;4(5):682-9. doi: 10.1002/cam4.383.

Our aim was to assess clinical characteristics and treatment of patients with GPA complicated by hematological malignancies with focus on leukemia and to describe these malignancies in more detail. METHODS: From the Swedish population-based patient register, all individuals with a diagnosis of GPA from 1964-2012 were identified (n = 3224). Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register, we searched for all cases of leukemia [International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 7: 204-207 and corresponding codes ICD 8-10] registered after the first discharge listing GPA. The GPA diagnosis was evaluated using the European Medical Association classification algorithm. To confirm the hematological malignancy, all diagnostic bone marrow samples were reclassified. Clinical data of both the GPA and hematological malignancy were collected from medical files. RESULTS: Twenty-one cases were identified, all of myeloid origin, including 9 with myelodysplastic syndrome developing to acute myeloid leukemia (MDS-AML), 7 AML, 3 MDS, and 2 chronic myeloid leukemia. The median time from GPA diagnosis to hematological malignancy was 8 years (range 5-21). All patients had severe generalized GPA and had received high doses of cyclophosphamide (CYC; median cumulative dose 96.5 g). Cytopenia occurred in 76% of the patients prior to the hematological malignancy. CONCLUSION: The findings emphasize the longterm risk of leukemia and MDS in CYC-treated, severely ill patients with GPA. Cytopenia during the course of GPA may be a warning sign and warrants a liberal attitude toward bone marrow examination.","['Knight, Ann', 'Hjorton, Karin', 'Sundstrom, Christer', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Backlin, Carin', 'Smedby, Karin E', 'Askling, Johan', 'Baecklund, Eva']","['Knight A', 'Hjorton K', 'Sundstrom C', 'Hoglund M', 'Backlin C', 'Smedby KE', 'Askling J', 'Baecklund E']","['From the Department of Medical Sciences, Section of Rheumatology, and Department of Medical Sciences, Section of Hematology, and Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala; Clinical Epidemiology Unit, and Rheumatology Unit, Department of Medicine, Solna; Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.A.

This is due to political unrest, limited health resources, and other pressing public health issues such as infectious diseases. Lack of awareness about the magnitude of the current and future cancer burden among policy makers play a major role as well. Although, the real scope of cancer in Sudan is not known, the reported cases have increased from 303 in 1967-6303 in 2010. According to Globocan estimates, the top most common cancers in both sexes are breast, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, esophagus, and colorectum. This review is the first of four papers that focuses on cancer, its distribution and trend as well as the risk factors most common in Sudan. It is expected that cancer will increase in Sudan as a result of migration of people from rural areas to urban cities in the pursuit of a better standard of living, which has resulted in lifestyle and behavioral changes that include tobacco chewing and smoking, unhealthy dieting, and a lack of physical activity. These changes are further exacerbated by the aging population and have made the country vulnerable to many diseases including cancer. These reviews are meant to provide a better understanding and knowledge required to plan appropriate cancer-control and prevention strategies in the country.","['Elamin, Amany', 'Ibrahim, Muntaser E', 'Abuidris, Dafalla', 'Mohamed, Kamal Eldin H', 'Mohammed, Sulma Ibrahim']","['Elamin A', 'Ibrahim ME', 'Abuidris D', 'Mohamed KE', 'Mohammed SI']","['Department of Comparative Pathobiology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907; Purdue University Center for Cancer Research, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47907; Commission for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, National Center for Research, Khartoum, Sudan.']",['eng'],['100715/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150130,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,"['Humans', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors', 'Sudan/epidemiology']",PMC4380970,,2015/02/03 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2014/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cam4.378 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2015 Mar;4(3):447-56. doi: 10.1002/cam4.378.

In preclinical studies, inhibiting ErbB2 blocked this resistance mechanism and resensitized cells to anti-EGFR therapy. Cetuximab targets EGFR, whereas lapatinib inhibits both EGFR and ErbB2. The objective of this phase 1 trial was to assess the safety, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of cetuximab and lapatinib in patients with solid tumors. METHODS: Patients received standard weekly cetuximab with escalating lapatinib doses of 750 mg, 1000 mg, or 1250 mg daily in 3-week cycles. DLTs were monitored through the end of cycle 2. Pretreatment and post-treatment tumor biopsies and germline DNA samples were obtained for correlative studies. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled, and 18 patients each were evaluable for toxicity and response. Fifty-nine percent of patients had received prior anti-EGFR therapy. Common toxicities included rash and diarrhea. No patient experienced a DLT at the highest dose level, and no grade 4 toxicity was observed. Response included no complete responses, 3 partial responses, 9 patients with stable disease, and 6 patients with disease progression, for an overall response rate of 17% and a clinical benefit rate of 67%. The clinical benefit rate in patients who had previously received anti-EGFR therapy was 70%. The mean treatment duration was 4.7 cycles (range, 1-14 cycles). Decreased expression of EGFR/ErbB2 pathway components after treatment was correlated with response, whereas increased expression in the PI3K, Jak/Stat, and MAPK pathways occurred in nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cetuximab and lapatinib was well tolerated, had the expected toxicities, and exhibited notable clinical activity, including in patients who had received previous anti-EGFR therapy. Further clinical study of this combination is warranted.","['Deeken, John F', 'Wang, Hongkun', 'Subramaniam, Deepa', 'He, Aiwu Ruth', 'Hwang, Jimmy', 'Marshall, John L', 'Urso, Christina E', 'Wang, Yiru', 'Ramos, Corinne', 'Steadman, Kenneth', 'Pishvaian, Michael J']","['Deeken JF', 'Wang H', 'Subramaniam D', 'He AR', 'Hwang J', 'Marshall JL', 'Urso CE', 'Wang Y', 'Ramos C', 'Steadman K', 'Pishvaian MJ']","['Inova Comprehensive Cancer and Research Institute, Falls Church, Virginia.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA051008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA051008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150129,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Anus Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Biopsy', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy', 'Cetuximab', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Diarrhea/chemically induced', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Eruptions/etiology', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Lapatinib', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4424139,['NIHMS652870'],2015/02/03 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2014/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29224 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 May 15;121(10):1645-53. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29224.

In this study, the anti-leukemic effect and the potential molecular mechanisms of action of flavokawain B on ALL were investigated. Flavokawain B was found to significantly inhibit the cellular proliferation of B-ALL and T-ALL cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. It also induced cellular apoptosis by increasing the expression of p53, Bax and Puma, and activating the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, the enhancement of p53-dependent apoptosis by flavokawain B could be rescued by pifithrin-alpha, a pharmacological inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity. Moreover, the proliferation of leukemia blast cells from 16 patients with ALL was inhibited by flavokawain B, and tumor growth in xenograft mice was also suppressed by this drug. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of flavokawain B for the treatment of ALL.","['Tang, Yan-Lai', 'Huang, Li-Bin', 'Tian, Yun', 'Wang, Li-Na', 'Zhang, Xiao-Li', 'Ke, Zhi-Yong', 'Deng, Wu-Guo', 'Luo, Xue-Qun']","['Tang YL', 'Huang LB', 'Tian Y', 'Wang LN', 'Zhang XL', 'Ke ZY', 'Deng WG', 'Luo XQ']","['a Department of Pediatrics , The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou , China.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou , China.', 'b Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine , Guangzhou , China.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou , China.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou , China.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou , China.', 'b Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cancer Medicine , Guangzhou , China.', 'a Department of Pediatrics , The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou , China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150223,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,,2015/02/03 06:00,2016/04/07 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.976819 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015;56(8):2398-407. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.976819.

METHODS: BM samples were obtained from 18 patients where matched samples at initial diagnosis and first BM relapse or complete remission were available. BM samples and cord blood samples (normal controls) were used to confirm the differential expression of miRNA-181a by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The expressions of miR-181a in both CCRF-CEM and its mutidrug-resistant counterpart CEM-C1 cells were also detected. Then, CCK-8 assay was performed to quantify the effects of miR-181a on CEM-C1 and CCRF-CEM cells growth and viability. RESULTS: Up-regulated miR-181a with higher fold changes in both initial diagnosis (4.84 +/- 2.71, 7.58 +/- 2.50) and relapsed samples (6.53 +/- 2.20) compared to normal controls (1.41 +/- 0.53) (P=0.017, 0.000, 0.001, respectively) were observed, whereas the miR-181a expression in the samples of CR (1.35 +/- 0.35) compared to normal control showed no significant difference (P=0.863). The miR-181a expression level was higher in CEM-C1 cells (-4.39 +/- 0.08) than of in CCRF-CEM cells (-2.32 +/- 0.03) (P=0.000). CCK-8 assay revealed that suppression of miR-181a in CEM-C1 cells by transfecting the specific inhibitor of miR-181a led to significantly higher cellular proliferation inhibition rate than negative control cells (P<0.05), IC50 were 30.61 ng/ml and 2 255.00 ng/ml with RI as 73.67. While increased miR-181a in CCRF-CEM cells led to significantly lower CPIR than negative control cells (P<0.01), IC50 were 126.60 ng/ml and 1.34 ng/ml with RI as 94.26. CONCLUSION: Upregulation of miR-181a might play an important role in the development of drug resistance in CEM-C1 cells, and knockdown of miR-181a could sensitize CEM-C1 cells to camptothecin; Meanwhile increased expression of miR-181a could promote CCRF-CEM drug resistance. These results suggested that suppression of miR-181a expression might provide a promising therapeutic in drug resistance of leukaemia.","['Liao, Wang', 'Liu, Xiaodan', 'Peng, Hongxia', 'Xu, Ling']","['Liao W', 'Liu X', 'Peng H', 'Xu L']","['Birth Cohort Study Lab, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510623, China.', 'Birth Cohort Study Lab, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510623, China.', 'Birth Cohort Study Lab, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510623, China.', 'Birth Cohort Study Lab, Guangzhou Women and Children Medical Center, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510623, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC7343040,,2015/02/03 06:00,2015/12/30 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2015.01.013 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2015 Jan;36(1):53-7. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2015.01.013.,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From December 1999 to December 2013, 353 consecutive hospitalized 18-65-year-old adult Ph(-) ALL patients were retrospectively analyzed. Induction therapy was CODP+/-L-asparaginase (L-Asp) regimen, and consolidation therapy included CODP and high dose methotrexate or revised Hyper-CVAD A and B regimens for 8 cycles. 178 patients (50.4%) performed allo-HSCT after three to five cycles of consolidation treatment, and 172 patients didn't receive allo-HSCT. The median follow-up was 39.9 months (2.0 to 171.0 months) for the 184 survivors. RESULTS: Three patients (0.85%) happened early death. CR rate after the first cycle of induction chemotherapy was 77.4% (271/350) among evaluated 350 patients. Overall CR rate was 92.9% (325/350). WBC >/= 100.0 x 10(9)/L (P=0.010) and hepatomegaly/splenomegaly/lymphadenopathy (P=0.036) were independent adverse factors for overall CR. Among the 325 CR patients, 117 patients developed relapse, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) at 5 years was 43.2%, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rates at 5 years were 44.7% and 45.6% respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that harboring central nervous system leukaemia (CNSL) at diagnose (P=0.004, P=0.002, P<0.001, respectively), induction regimen without L-Asp (P=0.023, P=0.009, P=0.004, respectively), time to CR more than 4 weeks (P=0.034, P=0.024, P=0.003, respectively), and non-allo-HSCT (P<0.001, P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively) were adverse factors of relapse, DFS and OS. In addition, high WBC count at diagnosis (>/= 30.0 x 10(9)/L for B lineage and >/= 100.0 x 10(9)/L for T lineage) was poor factor of DFS (P=0.044). Based on the four adverse prognostic factors of DFS above mentioned (including WBC at diagnose, harboring CNSL at diagnose, induction regimen with or without L-Asp, time to CR more than 4 weeks), patients were grouped into low risk (no factor), intermediate risk (one factor), and high risk (at least two factors). Non-allo-HSCT and allo-HSCT had similar outcomes in low risk subgroup. Allo-HSCT significantly improved OS and DFS in intermediate and high risk subgroups rather than non-allo-HSCT (all P values < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In adult Ph- ALL patients, high WBC count at diagnosis (>/= 30.0 x 10(9)/L for B lineage and >/= 100.0 x 10(9)/L for T lineage), CNSL at diagnosis, induction regimen without L-Asp, time to CR more than 4 weeks and non-allo-HSCT were adverse prognostic factors. Allo-HSCT improved OS and DFS in patients with more than one of the first four adverse prognosis factors.","['Wang, Jing', 'Huang, Xiaojun', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Jia, Jinsong', 'Yang, Shenmiao', 'Bao, Li', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Lu, Jin', 'Zhu, Honghu', 'Zhao, Ting', 'Jiang, Qian']","['Wang J', 'Huang X', 'Jiang B', 'Jia J', 'Yang S', 'Bao L', 'Jiang H', 'Lu J', 'Zhu H', 'Zhao T', 'Jiang Q']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC7343046,,2015/02/03 06:00,2015/12/30 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2015.01.003 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2015 Jan;36(1):10-5. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2015.01.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few studies have addressed the impact of dasatinib on normal blood cells, especially in vivo. Here we show that dasatinib leads to a reduced number of human CD19+ peripheral B cells owing to a strong induction of apoptosis. In contrast, no similar effect on T-cell viability was observed. However, dasatinib induced a comparable broad inhibition of the early events of B- and T-cell receptor signaling. Furthermore, dasatinib was shown to be a more pronounced inhibitor of both basal and B-cell receptor-induced activity of Bruton's tyrosine kinase and PLCgamma2 compared with the more specific Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. Human progenitor B cells from the pre-B stage were sensitive to dasatinib. In an in vivo murine model, dasatinib reduced B-lineage cells in the bone marrow with a marked effect on the pre-B subpopulation. Dasatinib led to a reduced spleen size, with a loss of large immature transitional immunoglobulin M(+)/immunoglobulin D(-) B cells and a reduction in germinal center B cells. Dasatinib caused a marked loss of thymocytes without affecting myeloid lineage cells or hematopoietic progenitors. This study reveals important side effects of dasatinib with specific loss of activated B and thymocyte populations, which may have an impact during long-term treatment.","['Oksvold, Morten P', 'Duyvestyn, Johanna M', 'Dagger, Samantha A', 'Taylor, Samuel J', 'Forfang, Lise', 'Myklebust, June H', 'Smeland, Erlend B', 'Langdon, Wallace Y']","['Oksvold MP', 'Duyvestyn JM', 'Dagger SA', 'Taylor SJ', 'Forfang L', 'Myklebust JH', 'Smeland EB', 'Langdon WY']","['Department of Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; Centre for Cancer Biomedicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.

One of the alterations which have gained attention in recent times is the altered energy and metabolic dependency of cancer originally proposed by Warburg. Mitochondria are important cell organelles regulating cellular energetic level, metabolism and apoptosis which in turn can affect cell proliferation and differentiation, the major manifestations of diseases like AML. In recent times the importance of mitochondrial generated ATP and mitochondrial localized metabolic pathways has been shown to play important role in the progression of AML.

The improved clinical outcome with successive Total Therapy (TT) protocols was limited to patients without RI. We therefore performed a retrospective analysis of overall survival, progression-free survival and time to progression (TTP) of patients enrolled in TT2 and TT3 in relationship to RI present at baseline and pre-transplant. Glomerular filtration rate was graded in four renal classes (RCs), RC1-RC4 (RC1 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2), RC2 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m(2), RC3 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and RC4 <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). RC1-3 had comparable clinical outcomes while RC4 was deleterious, even after improvement to better RC after transplant. Among the 85% of patients with gene expression profiling defined low-risk MM, Cox regression modeling of baseline and pre-transplant features, which also took into consideration RC improvement and MM complete response (CR), identified the presence of metaphase cytogenetic abnormalities and baseline RC4 as independent variables linked to inferior TTP post-transplant, while MM CR reduced the risk of progression and TTP by more than 60%. Failure to improve clinical outcomes despite RI improvement suggested MM-related causes. Although distinguishing RC4 from RC<4, 46 gene probes bore no apparent relationship to MM biology or survival.","['Khan, R', 'Apewokin, S', 'Grazziutti, M', 'Yaccoby, S', 'Epstein, J', 'van Rhee, F', 'Rosenthal, A', 'Waheed, S', 'Usmani, S', 'Atrash, S', 'Kumar, S', 'Hoering, A', 'Crowley, J', 'Shaughnessy, J D Jr', 'Barlogie, B']","['Khan R', 'Apewokin S', 'Grazziutti M', 'Yaccoby S', 'Epstein J', 'van Rhee F', 'Rosenthal A', 'Waheed S', 'Usmani S', 'Atrash S', 'Kumar S', 'Hoering A', 'Crowley J', 'Shaughnessy JD Jr', 'Barlogie B']","['Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Cancer Research and Biostatistics, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', '1] Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA [2] Levine Cancer Institute/Carolinas Healthcare System, Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.', 'Cancer Research and Biostatistics, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Cancer Research and Biostatistics, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Signal Genetics Inc, Carlsbad, CA, USA.', 'Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 55813/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20120202,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Plasma Cells/cytology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage', 'Renal Insufficiency/complications/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4430702,,2015/02/03 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2014/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201515 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.15 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 May;29(5):1195-201. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.15.

MAIN METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were treated either intramuscularly once with RoMS or twice daily for two weeks with rotigotine, and from the 9th day, MPTP (30 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected for the last 5 days. Following treatment, Parkinsonism scores were calculated and oxidative stress-related indicators in the striatum were performed. Neuroinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were detected in the striatum. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) was measured in the striatum by Western blot. Nigral tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons and microglial cell markers, i.e., ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1 (Iba-1) and neuronal synaptosomes, were quantified to assess the neuroprotective efficacy of RoMS. KEY FINDINGS: The administration of rotigotine significantly improved the Parkinsonism score, protected dopaminergic neurons with antioxidants, reduced microglial cell activation and the release of neuroinflammatory cytokines, and balanced the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in MPTP-treated mice. Interestingly, the neuroprotective properties of rotigotine were remarkably amplified by CDS treatment with RoMS. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that CDS therapy can play a neuroprotective role in an MPTP mouse model. Neuroprotective disease-modifying therapy may have the potential benefits of early treatment by normalizing compensatory mechanisms and may also help to delay dyskinesia in the later stages of PD.","['Yu, Xin', 'Yao, Jun-Yi', 'He, Jie', 'Tian, Jing-Wei']","['Yu X', 'Yao JY', 'He J', 'Tian JW']","['School of Pharmacy, Yantai University, Yantai 264005, PR China.

In this study, we examined the effects of triazoloacridinone C-1305, an antitumor compound, on AML cells with different FLT3 status in vitro. METHODS: A panel of human leukemic cell lines with different FLT3 status was used, including FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutations (FLT3-ITD, MV-4-11), wild-type FLT3 (RS-4-11) and null-FLT3 (U937) cells. Cell proliferation was estimated using MTT assays, and apoptosis was studied with flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. FLT3 kinase activity (phosphorylation of FLT3 at Tyr591) was determined with ELISA and Western blotting. FLT3 downstream signaling proteins involving AKT, MAPK and STAT5 were examined by Western blotting. RNA silencing was used to decrease the endogenous FLT3. RESULTS: The mutant FLT3-ITD cells were more sensitive to C-1305 than the wild-type FLT3 and null-FLT3 cells (the IC50 values measured at 24 h were 1.2+/-0.17, 2.0+/-09, 7.6+/-1.6 mumol/L, respectively). C-1305 (1-10 mumol/L) dose-dependently inhibited the kinase activity of FLT3, which was more pronounced in the mutant FLT3-ITD cells than in the wild-type FLT3 cells. Furthermore, C-1305 dose-dependently decreased the phosphorylation of STAT5 and MAPK and the inhibitory phosphorylation of Bad, and induced time- and dose-dependent apoptosis in the 3 cell lines with the null-FLT3 cells being the least susceptible to C-1305-induced apoptosis. Knockdown of FLT3 with siRNA significantly decreased C-1305-induced cytotoxicity in the mutant FLT3-ITD cells. CONCLUSION: C-1305 induces apoptosis in FLT3-ITD-expressing human leukemia cells in vitro, suggesting that mutated FLT3 kinase can be a new target for C-1305, and C-1305 may be a drug candidate for the therapeutic intervention in FLT3-associated AML.","['Augustin, Ewa', 'Skwarska, Anna', 'Weryszko, Anna', 'Pelikant, Iwona', 'Sankowska, Ewa', 'Borowa-Mazgaj, Barbara']","['Augustin E', 'Skwarska A', 'Weryszko A', 'Pelikant I', 'Sankowska E', 'Borowa-Mazgaj B']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biochemistry, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk 80233, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biochemistry, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk 80233, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biochemistry, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk 80233, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biochemistry, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk 80233, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biochemistry, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk 80233, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biochemistry, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk 80233, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150202,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,IM,"['Acridines/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4349925,,2015/02/03 06:00,2016/03/29 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2014/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['aps2014142 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2014.142 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2015 Mar;36(3):385-99. doi: 10.1038/aps.2014.142.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 2011 and April 2013 in a case-control study conducted in Nemazee Hospital in Shiraz, Southern Iran; 314 subjects diagnosed with acute leukemia (94 pediatric cases and 220 adults) were enrolled to determine any correlation between exposure to pesticides and the occurrence. Controls (n=314) were matched by sex and age. RESULTS: There was a history of exposure to pesticides among 85% of pediatric cases and 69% of their controls and 83% of adult cases and 75% of their controls while 87.5% of pediatric cases and 90% of adult cases reported exposure to intermediate and high doses of pesticides and among the controls, the exposure to low doses of pesticides was 70.5% and 65%, respectively.

It is increasingly registered in Iraq and Basrah but the epidemiological situation, though becoming better documented, is still questionable regarding the adequacy of data. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to measure the incidence of cancer in Basrah. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results presented in this paper are part of a large household survey carried out in Basrah governorate-southern Iraq over a 12 month period (January to December 2013). It involved a detailed interview with adult respondents from each and every household enrolled in the study during a three-year recall period about the incidence of cancer. A total of 6,999 households were covered yielding 40,684 persons. RESULTS: The total number of new cancer cases reported over the three- year recall period (2010-2012) was 112. The average annual incidence rate of all cancers was 91.8 per 100,000 population with a higher rate for females (109.7) compared to males (74.3) The overall age standardized rate was 150.7 per 100,000. The highest incidence rate was recorded for the Southern part of the governorate (Abul-Khasib and Fao ) at 138.8 per 100,000 and the lowest was for East of Basrah (Shatt-Arab District) at 78.0 per 100,000. With respect to cancer types, the main cancers were those of breast, lung, larynx-pharynx, leukaemia, colon-rectum and urinary bladder. These six cancers accounted for 51.5% of all reported cases. Other important cancers were those of brain, bones, pancreas and liver, accounting for a further 17.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of cancer in Basrah is generally similar to the pattern at the national level in terms of age, sex and topography but the incidence rate according to the present household survey is higher than any previously reported figures.

However, only ~65% of AML patients respond to induction chemotherapy and the overall survival rate for AML remains low (~24% for 5-year survival). The conventional view suggests that ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters contribute to treatment failure due to their drug-effluxing capabilities. This might be overly simplistic. Some ABC transporters export endogenous substrates that have defined roles in normal hematopoietic progenitors. It is conceivable that these substances also provide an advantage to leukemic progenitors. This review will highlight how certain endogenous substrates impact normal hematopoietic cells and suggest that ABC transporters facilitate export of these substances to affect both normal hematopoietic and leukemic progenitors. For example, the ability to export certain endogenous ligands may facilitate leukemogenesis by modifying leukemic progenitor cell proliferation or survival. If so, the addition of ABC transporter inhibitors to traditional chemotherapy might improve therapeutic efficacy by not just increasing intracellular drug accumulation but also blocking the beneficial effects ABC transporter ligands have on cell survival.","['Fukuda, Yu', 'Lian, Shangli', 'Schuetz, John D']","['Fukuda Y', 'Lian S', 'Schuetz JD']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.

We identified and validated the induction and secretion of the neuropeptide galanin in OCs, specifically in response to LIF. We next established that galanin is an OC survival factor and showed that autocrine or paracrine galanin secretion mediates LIF-induced OC survival in vitro. We also revealed that galanin is up-regulated in OCs in the cuprizone model of central demyelination, and that oligodendroglial galanin expression is significantly regulated by endogenous LIF in this context. We also showed that knock-out of galanin reduces OC survival and exacerbates callosal demyelination in the cuprizone model. These findings suggest a potential role for the use of galanin agonists in the treatment of human demyelinating diseases.","['Gresle, Melissa M', 'Butzkueven, Helmut', 'Perreau, Victoria M', 'Jonas, Anna', 'Xiao, Junhua', 'Thiem, Stefan', 'Holmes, Fiona E', 'Doherty, William', 'Soo, Pik-Ying', 'Binder, Michele D', 'Akkermann, Rainer', 'Jokubaitis, Vilija G', 'Cate, Holly S', 'Marriott, Mark P', 'Gundlach, Andrew L', 'Wynick, David', 'Kilpatrick, Trevor J']","['Gresle MM', 'Butzkueven H', 'Perreau VM', 'Jonas A', 'Xiao J', 'Thiem S', 'Holmes FE', 'Doherty W', 'Soo PY', 'Binder MD', 'Akkermann R', 'Jokubaitis VG', 'Cate HS', 'Marriott MP', 'Gundlach AL', 'Wynick D', 'Kilpatrick TJ']","['Melbourne Brain Centre at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne, Australia; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['12/0004538/Diabetes UK/United Kingdom', 'G0300028/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G1000863/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'AG10668/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150129,United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/pathology/physiology', 'Brain/pathology/physiopathology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cuprizone', 'Demyelinating Diseases/pathology/physiopathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Galanin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myelin Sheath/pathology/*physiology', 'Neural Stem Cells/pathology/physiology', 'Oligodendroglia/pathology/*physiology', 'Optic Nerve/pathology/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",,,2015/02/03 06:00,2016/01/09 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2013/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/glia.22798 [doi]'],ppublish,Glia. 2015 Jun;63(6):1005-20. doi: 10.1002/glia.22798.

In addition to myeloid malignancies, mutations in DNMT3A have been recently reported in T-cell lymphoma and leukemia, implying a possible involvement in the pathogenesis of human diseases. However, the role of Dnmt3a in T-cell transformation in vivo is poorly understood. Here we analyzed the functional consequences of Dnmt3a inactivation in a mouse model of MYC-induced T-cell lymphomagenesis (MTCL). Loss of Dnmt3a delayed tumorigenesis by suppressing cellular proliferation during disease progression. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis identified upregulation of 17 putative tumor suppressor genes, including DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3b, in Dnmt3a-deficient lymphomas as molecular events potentially responsible for the delayed lymphomagenesis in Dnmt3a(Delta/Delta) mice. Interestingly, promoter and gene body methylation of these genes was not substantially changed between control and Dnmt3a-deficient lymphomas, suggesting that Dnmt3a may inhibit their expression in a methylation-independent manner. Re-expression of both wild type and catalytically inactive Dnmt3a in Dnmt3a(Delta/Delta) lymphoma cells in vitro inhibited Dnmt3b expression, indicating that Dnmt3b upregulation may be directly repressed by Dnmt3a. Importantly, genetic inactivation of Dnmt3b accelerated lymphomagenesis in Dnmt3a(Delta/Delta) mice, demonstrating that upregulation of Dnmt3b is a relevant molecular change in Dnmt3a-deficient lymphomas that inhibits disease progression. Collectively, our data demonstrate an unexpected oncogenic role for Dnmt3a in MTCL through methylation-independent repression of Dnmt3b and possibly other tumor suppressor genes.","['Haney, Staci L', 'Hlady, Ryan A', 'Opavska, Jana', 'Klinkebiel, David', 'Pirruccello, Samuel J', 'Dutta, Samikshan', 'Datta, Kaustubh', 'Simpson, Melanie A', 'Wu, Lizhao', 'Opavsky, Rene']","['Haney SL', 'Hlady RA', 'Opavska J', 'Klinkebiel D', 'Pirruccello SJ', 'Dutta S', 'Datta K', 'Simpson MA', 'Wu L', 'Opavsky R']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School-Cancer Center, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.', 'Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia Research, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska, USA.']",['eng'],"['P20 GM103471/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 GM110768/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20150202,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'Transcriptome/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",PMC4533871,['NIHMS711378'],2015/02/03 06:00,2016/01/29 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2014/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/onc.2014.472 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Oct;34(43):5436-5446. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.472.

However, it is critical to recognize that even in the setting of a genetic disease, the B-cell/plasma cell tumor microenvironment (TME) contributes significantly to malignant transformation and pathogenesis. Over a decade ago, we proposed the concept of cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance to delineate a form of TME-mediated drug resistance that protects hematopoietic tumor cells from the initial effect of diverse therapies. In the interim, it has been increasingly appreciated that TME also contributes to tumor initiation and progression through sustained growth/proliferation, self-renewal capacity, immune evasion, migration and invasion as well as resistance to cell death in a host of B-cell malignancies, including mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Waldenstroms macroglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma. Within this review, we propose that TME and the tumor co-evolve as a consequence of bidirectional signaling networks. As such, TME represents an important target and should be considered integral to tumor progression and drug response.","['Shain, K H', 'Dalton, W S', 'Tao, J']","['Shain KH', 'Dalton WS', 'Tao J']","['Department of Malignant Hematology and Chemical Biology and Molecular Medicine Program, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology and Chemical Biology and Molecular Medicine Program, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'DeBartolo Family Personalized Medicine Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology and Laboratory Medicine, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute at the University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30-CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA137123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA174664/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA137123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150202,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*genetics']",PMC4688902,['NIHMS736560'],2015/02/03 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2014/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014403 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.403 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Sep 3;34(36):4673-82. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.403.

The Hedgehog (HH)/GLI pathway has been implicated in a variety of cancer entities and targeted pathway inhibition is of therapeutic relevance. Signal cross-talk with other cancer pathways including PI3K/AKT modulates HH/GLI signal strength and its oncogenicity. In this study, we addressed the role of HH/GLI and its putative interaction with the PI3K/AKT cascade in the initiation and maintenance of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Using transgenic mouse models, we show that B-cell-specific constitutive activation of HH/GLI signaling either at the level of the HH effector and drug target Smoothened or at the level of the GLI transcription factors does not suffice to initiate a CLL-like phenotype characterized by the accumulation of CD5(+) B cells in the lymphatic system and peripheral blood. Furthermore, Hh/Gli activation in Pten-deficient B cells with activated Pi3K/Akt signaling failed to enhance the expansion of leukemic CD5(+) B cells, suggesting that genetic or epigenetic alterations leading to aberrant HH/GLI signaling in B cells do not suffice to elicit a CLL-like phenotype in mice. By contrast, we identify a critical role of GLI and PI3K signaling for the survival of human primary CLL cells. We show that combined targeting of GLI and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling can have a synergistic therapeutic effect in cells from a subgroup of CLL patients, thereby providing a basis for the evaluation of future combination therapies targeting HH/GLI and PI3K signaling in this common hematopoietic malignancy.","['Kern, D', 'Regl, G', 'Hofbauer, S W', 'Altenhofer, P', 'Achatz, G', 'Dlugosz, A', 'Schnidar, H', 'Greil, R', 'Hartmann, T N', 'Aberger, F']","['Kern D', 'Regl G', 'Hofbauer SW', 'Altenhofer P', 'Achatz G', 'Dlugosz A', 'Schnidar H', 'Greil R', 'Hartmann TN', 'Aberger F']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, 3rd Medical Department with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, 3rd Medical Department with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'University of Michigan, Dermatology and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'APEIRON Biologics AG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, 3rd Medical Department with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, 3rd Medical Department with Haematology, Medical Oncology, Haemostaseology, Infectious Diseases, and Rheumatology, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Paris-Lodron University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],"['P 25629/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'P30 CA046592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'W 1213/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'P 20652/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'R01 CA087837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150202,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Smoothened Receptor', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1']",PMC4430320,['EMS61514'],2015/02/03 06:00,2016/02/06 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2014/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014450 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.450 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Oct 16;34(42):5341-51. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.450.

However, population-based studies looking at survival suggest that approximately 30% of patients with APL die during induction. Early demonstration of t(15;17) will lead to accurate decision making regarding treatment. The aim of this project was to validate earlier time frames for the Abbott Molecular Vysis LSI promyelocytic leukemia (PML)/ retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe (ASR 6-16 h). METHODS: Twenty patients (15 APL cases and five non-APL cases) were selected for validating various hybridization times for the FISH probe. Expected normal signal pattern was two red and two green signals (2R2G), and the most common expected abnormal signal pattern was two fusion (yellow) signals, one red and one green (2F1R1G) and/or one fusion, one red and one green (1F1R1G). RESULTS: The specificity of the probe ranged from 84% at 2 h, 86% at 4 h, 84% at 6 h, and 87% for overnight hybridization. The sensitivity increased from 79% at 2 h, 80% at 4 h, 81% at 6 h to 87% for overnight hybridization.

Cobalt oxide nanoparticles (CoO NPs) are an interesting compound for oxidative cancer therapy. Our results showed that CoO NPs elicited a significant (P <0.05) amount of ROS in cancer cells. Co-treatment with N-aceyltine cystine (an inhibitor of ROS) had a protective role in cancer cell death induced by CoO NPs. In cultured cells, the elevated level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was noted after CoO NPs treatment. This TNF-alpha persuaded activation of caspase-8 followed by phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and induced cell death. This study showed that CoO NPs induced oxidative stress and activated the signaling pathway of TNF-alpha-Caspase-8-p38-Caspase-3 to cancer cells.","['Chattopadhyay, Sourav', 'Dash, Sandeep Kumar', 'Tripathy, Satyajit', 'Das, Balaram', 'Kar Mahapatra, Santanu', 'Pramanik, Panchanan', 'Roy, Somenath']","['Chattopadhyay S', 'Dash SK', 'Tripathy S', 'Das B', 'Kar Mahapatra S', 'Pramanik P', 'Roy S']","['Immunology and Microbiology Laboratory, Department of Human Physiology with Community Health, Vidyasagar University, Midnapore, -721 102, West Bengal, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150111,England,J Appl Toxicol,Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,8109495,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 8/*physiology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cobalt/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/physiology', 'Metal Nanoparticles/*adverse effects', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects/physiology', 'Oxides/*adverse effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology']",,,2015/02/03 06:00,2016/04/12 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2014/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jat.3080 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Toxicol. 2015 Jun;35(6):603-13. doi: 10.1002/jat.3080.

METHODS: We evaluated outcomes of 480 patients (age 8-60 years), classified into good, intermediate and poor risk according to cytogenetic results. Standard ""3 + 7"" induction therapy with dose of daunorubicin ranging from 45 to 90 mg/m(2) followed by two to three courses of high-dose cytarabine (12-18 g/m(2) ) as consolidation therapy was given to majority. RESULTS: The complete remission rate of the treated population (407 patients) was 70% with 84.8% in good risk, 67.9% in intermediate risk and 54.2% in poor risk (P = 0.0001). Induction mortality was 18.4%. One hundred twenty-nine patients relapsed with median treatment free interval of 10.4 months. At a median follow-up of 34.5 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 20.6 months with an estimated 5-year survival rate of 35.5%. No difference was found in OS between the three risk groups; however, patients with intermediate risk had a better leukemia-free survival (LFS) in comparison to good risk. Multivariate analysis showed age, performance status, treatment completion and hematopoietic stem cell transplant affecting OS, while only treatment completion affected LFS. CONCLUSION: This is one of the largest single-center studies reflecting more accurately the outcome of AML in India. These results are likely due to uniform treatment protocols, intensification of induction and post-remission treatments with comprehensive supportive care.","['Bahl, Ankur', 'Sharma, Atul', 'Raina, Vinod', 'Kumar, Lalit', 'Bakhshi, Sameer', 'Gupta, Ritu', 'Kumar, Rajeev']","['Bahl A', 'Sharma A', 'Raina V', 'Kumar L', 'Bakhshi S', 'Gupta R', 'Kumar R']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.

The RNA-seq and small RNA-seq provide a new source for the discovery of differentially expressed SSRs (simple sequence repeats) as biomarkers in various diseases. In the present study, for the first time, we applied RNA-seq SSR to find new biomarkers for pancreatic cancer (PC) diagnosis. Analysis of RNA-seq data revealed a significant alternation in the frequency of SSR motifs during cancer progression. In particular, RNA-seq SSR showed an increase in the frequencies of GCC/GGC and GCG/CGC motifs in PC samples compared to healthy pancreas. These findings were further confirmed using meta-analysis of EST-SSR data in 11 different cancers. Interestingly, the genes containing GCC/GGC and GCG/CGC motifs in their sequences were involved in many cancer-related biological processes, particularly regulation processes. The small RNA-seq data were also mined for the conserved patterns in SSR frequencies (sRNA-seq SSR) during cancer progression. Based on the results, we suggest the potential use of GCC/GGC and GCG/CGC motifs as biomarkers in PC. Based on the findings of this study, it seems that RNA-seq SSR and sRNA-seq SSR could open a new paradigm in the diagnostic and even therapeutic strategies for PC along the other types of cancers.","['Alisoltani, Arghavan', 'Fallahi, Hossein', 'Shiran, Behrouz', 'Alisoltani, Anousheh', 'Ebrahimie, Esmaeil']","['Alisoltani A', 'Fallahi H', 'Shiran B', 'Alisoltani A', 'Ebrahimie E']","['Biotechnology Group, Shahrekord University, Shahrekord, Iran.

Inheritance is autosomal dominant and is caused by heterozygous mutations in the p53 gene. The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria: a person under the age of 45 years suffering from sarcoma, the closest relative younger than 45 years diagnosed with cancer and a relative of the first or second degree, which is up to 45 years, was diagnosed with cancer and was diagnosed with sarcoma at any age. CASE REPORT: The presented family with three members diagnosed with malignant disease typical for LFS suggests the need to carefully follow those diagnosed with LFS related tumor. A 24-year-old man diagnosed and treated for osteosarcoma of the maxilla died in the first year. His younger brother was submitted to surgery due to osteosarcoma of the mandible three years later, and a year later in his 24 year he had no signs of locoregional recurrence. Their mother was operated in 1996 for glioblastoma multiform brain cancer and ductal carcinoma, and died two years later at the age of 33. CONCLUSION: The presented family highlights the need for careful examination, inspection and notification of the risks of family members diagnosed with LFS related tumors.","['Ilic, Miroslav P', 'Kiralj, Aleksandar', 'Markov, Borislav', 'Mijatov, Ivana', 'Mijatov, Sasa', 'Vuckovic, Nada']","['Ilic MP', 'Kiralj A', 'Markov B', 'Mijatov I', 'Mijatov S', 'Vuckovic N']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mandibular Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Maxillary Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Osteosarcoma/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/02/03 06:00,2015/07/17 06:00,['2015/02/03 06:00'],"['2015/02/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2298/vsp1412159i [doi]'],ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2014 Dec;71(12):1159-62. doi: 10.2298/vsp1412159i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the potential relationship between pre-hospitalization exposure to sources of fungi and the development of invasive fungal infections in adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia after their first course of chemotherapy. From January 2010 to April 2012, all consecutive acute myeloid leukemia patients in 33 Italian centers were prospectively registered. Upon first admission, information about possible pre-chemotherapy risk factors and environmental exposure was collected. We recorded data regarding comorbid conditions, employment, hygienic habits, working and living environment, personal habits, hobbies, and pets. All invasive fungal infections occurring within 30 days after the first course of chemotherapy were recorded. Of the 1,192 patients enrolled in this study, 881 received intensive chemotherapy and were included in the present analysis. Of these, 214 developed an invasive fungal infection, including 77 proven/probable cases (8.7%). Of these 77 cases, 54 were proven/probable invasive mold infections (6.1%) and 23 were proven yeast infections (2.6%). Upon univariate analysis, a significant association was found between invasive mold infections and age, performance status, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, cocaine use, job, hobbies, and a recent house renovation. Higher body weight resulted in a reduced risk of invasive mold infections. Multivariate analysis confirmed the role of performance status, job, body weight, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and house renovation. In conclusion, several hospital-independent variables could potentially influence the onset of invasive mold infections in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

Most patients are detected incidentally at an early stage and require 'watch and wait' follow-up. In the UK, management of Stage A0 CLL varies with some centres advising regular outpatient haematology follow-up, whereas others recommend management within primary care. The safety and effectiveness of these two management options are currently unknown. METHODS: An observational retrospective cohort study in outpatient Haematology clinics at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEH) and Birmingham Heartlands Hospital (BHH) and primary care practices in West Midlands, UK. All patients diagnosed with stable stage A0 CLL since 2002 at BHH or QEH were identified. At BHH, patients were discharged to primary care follow-up, whilst QEH patients remained under haematology for follow-up. Evidence of disease progression, need for treatment and overall mortality was documented. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-six Stage A0 CLL patients were identified. One hundred and five (43%) patients were discharged to primary care, whilst 141 (57%) patients were followed up in haematology outpatient clinics. No difference in mortality or need for treatment was found between the two groups. Of those discharged, 93 (66%) remained in primary care. CONCLUSION: The management of stable-stage A0 CLL within primary or secondary care leads to equivalent clinical outcomes. The prevalence of early-stage CLL is expected to increase with the ageing population and management within primary care should be considered as a potentially effective approach.","['Parry, H M', 'Damery, S', 'Mudondo, N P', 'Hazlewood, P', 'McSkeane, T', 'Aung, S', 'Murray, J', 'Pratt, G', 'Moss, P', 'Milligan, D W']","['Parry HM', 'Damery S', 'Mudondo NP', 'Hazlewood P', 'McSkeane T', 'Aung S', 'Murray J', 'Pratt G', 'Moss P', 'Milligan DW']","['From the Cancer Sciences.', 'School of Primary Care Clinical Sciences.', 'School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, West Midlands B15 2TT, UK.', 'From the Cancer Sciences.', 'From the Cancer Sciences.', 'Centre for Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, West Midlands B9 5SS, UK and.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Morris House, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, West Midlands B15 2TH, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, West Midlands B9 5SS, UK and.', 'From the Cancer Sciences.', 'Centre for Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, West Midlands B9 5SS, UK and d.w.milligan@bham.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150131,England,QJM,QJM : monthly journal of the Association of Physicians,9438285,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*mortality/*therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Outpatients', 'Primary Health Care/*organization & administration', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Time-to-Treatment/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC4586947,,2015/02/02 06:00,2016/07/22 06:00,['2015/02/02 06:00'],"['2014/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['hcv017 [pii]', '10.1093/qjmed/hcv017 [doi]']",ppublish,QJM. 2015 Oct;108(10):789-94. doi: 10.1093/qjmed/hcv017.

METHODS: During the past thirteen years we have reviewed and updated the curriculum of the medical school of the Universidade Estadual de Campinas. The main objective of the new curriculum is to teach the students how to learn to learn. Since then, a case of chronic myeloid leukemia has been introduced to first year medical students and discussed in horizontal integration with all themes taught during a molecular and cell biology course. Cell structure and components, protein, chromosomes, gene organization, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, signaling and so on are all themes approached during this course. At the end of every topic approached, the students prepare in advance the corresponding topic of clinical cases chosen randomly during the class, which are then presented by them. During the final class, a paper regarding mutations in the abl gene that cause resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors is discussed. After each class, three tests are solved in an interactive evaluation. RESULTS: The course has been successful since its beginning, 13 years ago. Great motivation of those who participated in the course was observed. There were less than 20% absences in the classes. At least three (and as many as nine) students every year were interested in starting research training in the field of hematology. At the end of each class, an interactive evaluation was performed and more than 70% of the answers were correct in each evaluation. Moreover, for the final evaluation, the students summarized, in a written report, the molecular and therapeutic basis of chronic myeloid leukemia, with scores ranging from 0 to 10. Considering all 13 years, a median of 78% of the class scored above 5 (min 74%-max 85%), and a median of 67% scored above 7. CONCLUSION: Chronic myeloid leukemia is an excellent example of a disease that can be used for clinical basic integration as this disorder involves well known protein, cytogenetic and cell function abnormalities, has well-defined diagnostic strategies and a target oriented therapy.","['Saad, Sara Teresinha Olalla', 'Carvalho, Hernandes Faustino']","['Saad ST', 'Carvalho HF']","['Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), Campinas, SP, Brazil.

METHODS: Twenty-two patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and three with myelodysplastic syndromes were studied. The G-banding karyotyping and single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis (CytoScan((R)) HD) were performed using cells from bone marrow, DNA extracted from mononuclear cells from bone marrow and buccal cells (BC). RESULTS: The mean age of the patients studied was 54 years old, and the median age was 55 years (range: 28-93). Twelve (48%) were male and 13 (52%) female. Ten patients showed abnormal karyotypes (40.0%), 11 normal (44.0%) and four had no mitosis (16.0%). Regarding the results of bone marrow single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis: 17 were abnormal (68.0%) and eight were normal (32.0%). Comparing the two methods, karyotyping identified a total of 17 alterations (8 deletions/losses, 7 trissomies/gains, and 2 translocations) and single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis identified a total of 42 alterations (17 losses, 16 gains and 9 copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity). CONCLUSION: It is possible to standardize single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis in acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes and compare the results with the abnormalities detected by karyotyping. Single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis increased the detection rate of abnormalities compared to karyotyping and also identified a new set of abnormalities that deserve further investigation in future studies.","['Noronha, Thiago Rodrigo de', 'Rohr, Sandra Serson', 'Chauffaille, Maria de Lourdes Lopes Ferrari']","['Noronha TR', 'Rohr SS', 'Chauffaille Mde L']","['Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.

METHODS: The overall survival and disease-free survival were statistically evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test and multivariate evaluation by Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: The study population was predominantly younger than 60 years old (81,6%), had intermediate cytogenetic risk (40.8%), in first complete remission after induction chemotherapy (46.9%), with a white blood count at diagnosis of less than 30x10(9)/L (57.1%) and de novo acute myeloid leukemia (62.2%). Survival curves showed that better prognosis was related to age below 60 years (median:12,4 months; p-value=0,2227; Odds Ratio=0,6676), good prognostic cytogenetic markers (median: 97.7 months; p-value=0.0037; Odds Ratio=0.4239) and white blood cell count at diagnosis of less than 30x10(9)/L (median survival: 23.6 months; p-value=0.0001; Odds Ratio=0.3651).

The Philadelphia chromosome is detected by karyotyping in around 90% of chronic myeloid leukemia patients, but 5-10% may have variant types. Variant Philadelphia chromosomes are characterized by the involvement of another chromosome in addition to chromosome 9 or 22. It can be a simple type of variant when one other chromosome is involved, or complex, in which two or more chromosomes take part in the translocation. Few studies have reported the incidence of variant Philadelphia chromosomes or the breakpoints involved among Brazilian chronic myeloid leukemia patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this report is to describe the diversity of the variant Philadelphia chromosomes found and highlight some interesting breakpoint candidates for further studies. METHODS: the Cytogenetics Section Database was searched for all cases with diagnoses of chronic myeloid leukemia during a 12-year period and all the variant Philadelphia chromosomes were listed. RESULTS: Fifty (5.17%) cases out of 1071 Philadelphia-positive chronic myeloid leukemia were variants. The most frequently involved chromosome was 17, followed by chromosomes: 1, 20, 6, 11, 2, 10, 12 and 15. CONCLUSION: Among all the breakpoints seen in this survey, six had previously been described: 11p15, 14q32, 15q11.2, 16p13.1, 17p13 and 17q21.

METHODS: Data from the Brazilian National Health Service database DATASUS provided the number of deaths caused by myeloid leukemia and the number of inhabitants per year in the Regional Health Division XVII from 1994 to 2011. Registries were categorized according to gender into four age ranges (over 20 years, 20-49, 50-69 and over 70 years) for an estimation of the annual percent change for age-adjusted mortality rates. The percent changes were calculated using the Joinpoint regression analysis model. RESULTS: Overall, a significant decline per year was demonstrated for the entire sample (over 20 years) across the 18-year period studied (annual percent change: -5.59%; 95% CI: -8.5 to -2.5% for males; p-value<0.05 and -7.02%; 95% CI -11.2 to -2.8% for females; p-value<0.05) with no significant difference between genders. In an analysis using two Joinpoints, significant drops were observed from 1994 to 2001 (annual percent change: -21.22%; 95% confidence interval: -27.9 to -13.9%; p-value<0.05) and from 1994 to 2003 (annual percent change: -12.86%; 95% confidence interval -22.2 to -2.5%; p-value<0.05) for men and women, respectively. The declining trends were greatest for patients aged over 70 years with the age-adjusted mortality rates in younger groups declining non-significantly except for males aged 50-69 years old. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a significant decline per year in age-adjusted mortality rates of adult patients diagnosed with myeloid leukemia from 1994 to 2011 in the Vale do Paraiba, State of Sao Paulo.","['Callera, Fernando', 'Callera, Alexandra Fernandes', 'Rosa, Evandro Secchi']","['Callera F', 'Callera AF', 'Rosa ES']","['Centro de Hematologia do Vale, Sao Jose dos Campos, SP, Brazil.

The currently available data provide a rationale for development of Mer kinase inhibitors as cancer therapeutics that can target both cell autologous and immune-modulatory anti-tumor effects. We have previously reported several series of potent Mer inhibitors and the objective of the current report is to identify a chemically dissimilar back-up series that might circumvent potential, but currently unknown, flaws inherent to the lead series. To this end, we virtually screened a database of approximately 3.8million commercially available compounds using high-throughput docking followed by a filter involving Structural Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprints (SPLIF). SPLIF permits a quantitative assessment of whether a docking pose interacts with the protein target similarly to an endogenous or known synthetic ligand, and therefore helps to improve both sensitivity and specificity with respect to the docking score alone. Of the total of 62 experimentally tested compounds, 15 demonstrated reliable dose-dependent responses in the Mer in vitro kinase activity assay with inhibitory potencies ranging from 0.46muM to 9.9muM.","['Da, C', 'Stashko, M', 'Jayakody, C', 'Wang, X', 'Janzen, W', 'Frye, S', 'Kireev, D']","['Da C', 'Stashko M', 'Jayakody C', 'Wang X', 'Janzen W', 'Frye S', 'Kireev D']","['Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB #7360, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7363, United States.', 'Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB #7360, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7363, United States.', 'Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB #7360, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7363, United States.', 'Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB #7360, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7363, United States.', 'Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB #7360, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7363, United States.', 'Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB #7360, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7363, United States.', 'Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB #7360, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7363, United States.

The data suggest that myeloid progenitors contribute to the pathogenesis of PAH, but there are little data on the prevalence of pulmonary vascular disease among the different forms of myeloid diseases. We hypothesized that there would be a higher prevalence of pulmonary vascular disease in myeloproliferative neoplasms that have high circulating progenitor cells, such as myelofibrosis and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), compared with those with low circulating progenitors, such as in aplastic anemia. METHODS: Patients with myelofibrosis, CML, and aplastic anemia who underwent echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac function in preparation for bone marrow transplantation at the Cleveland Clinic between 1997 and 2012 were identified and their electronic medical records were queried for demographic data, blood cell counts, and pulmonary function tests. All echocardiograms were uniformly analyzed in a blinded fashion by an advanced sonographer and cardiologist for measures of right and left ventricular function and estimation of pulmonary vascular disease. RESULTS: Gender and race distribution among disease groups was similar. Patients with myelofibrosis (n = 19) and aplastic anemia (n = 30) had increased right ventricle (RV) wall thickness compared with CML (n = 82) patients (aplastic anemia, 0.7 +/- 0.1; CML, 0.5 +/- 0.1; and myelofibrosis, 0.7 +/- 0.1; p = 0.02). Patients with myelofibrosis had higher levels of estimated RV systolic pressure compared with the other groups (aplastic anemia, 29.9 +/- 1.5; CML, 26.2 +/- 1.1; and myelofibrosis, 36.7 +/- 3.7 mm Hg; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest an important role for myeloid progenitors in the maintenance of pulmonary-vascular health, in which abnormal myeloproliferative progenitors are associated with RV pathology.","['Roach, Emir C', 'Park, Margaret M', 'Tang, W H Wilson', 'Thomas, James D', 'Asosingh, Kewal', 'Kalaycio, Matt', 'Erzurum, Serpil C', 'Farha, Samar']","['Roach EC', 'Park MM', 'Tang WH', 'Thomas JD', 'Asosingh K', 'Kalaycio M', 'Erzurum SC', 'Farha S']","['Department of Pathobiology, Lerner Research Institute.', 'Heart & Vascular Institute.', 'Heart & Vascular Institute.', 'Heart & Vascular Institute.', 'Department of Pathobiology, Lerner Research Institute.', 'Taussig Cancer Institute.', 'Department of Pathobiology, Lerner Research Institute; Respiratory Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Department of Pathobiology, Lerner Research Institute; Respiratory Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.

The expressed product was confirmed using SDS-PAGE and western blot that it is about 46KD of recombinant protein. The purified recombinant proteins combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant or Freund's adjuvant were inoculated into the breeder hens, the ALV-A antibodies in serum and in egg-yolk were detected; the fertilized eggs from the vaccinated hens with different titers of egg-yolk antibody were hatched and then challenged with 10(4.2)/0.1mL TCID50 of ALV-A-SDAU09C1 strain, all the hatched chickens were weekly detected for the viremias and the cloacal swab P27 antigen and pathological lesions; the neutralizing test of antisera in vitro was conducted. The results showed that the recombinant gp85 proteins combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant could induce the breeder hens to produce better antibody responses than gp85 protein with Freund's adjuvant or without adjuvant; the MAbs with higher titers induced by CpG-ODN+gp85 proteins could obviously decrease the ratios of viremias (13% vs 33%), cloacal detoxification (20% vs 67%) and death (0% vs 22%) caused by ALV-A infection than those by gp85 protein without adjuvant. The results of the neutralizing test indicated that the antisera from the hatched chickens could neutralize the ALV-A-SDAU09C1 strain in vitro, but which depends on the antibody titers. The results of IFA confirmed that the serum antibody could combine with the ALV in DF1 cells. It can be concluded that the prepared ALV-A gp85 subunit vaccine combining with CpG-ODN adjuvant could induce the breeder hens to produce better neutralizing antibody responses and protect 80% of their offspring chickens against early infection.","['Zhang, Dandan', 'Li, Hongmei', 'Zhang, Zhongsheng', 'Sun, Shuhong', 'Cheng, Ziqiang', 'Liu, Jianzhu', 'Zhao, Peng', 'Ren, Qingya', 'Guo, Huijun']","['Zhang D', 'Li H', 'Zhang Z', 'Sun S', 'Cheng Z', 'Liu J', 'Zhao P', 'Ren Q', 'Guo H']","[""College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Center for Animal Disease Control Engineering Shandong Province, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Center for Animal Disease Control Engineering Shandong Province, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Center for Animal Disease Control Engineering Shandong Province, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Center for Animal Disease Control Engineering Shandong Province, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Center for Animal Disease Control Engineering Shandong Province, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Center for Animal Disease Control Engineering Shandong Province, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Center for Animal Disease Control Engineering Shandong Province, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Center for Animal Disease Control Engineering Shandong Province, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Center for Animal Disease Control Engineering Shandong Province, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an 271018, China.

In this study, haematological, biochemical and histological parameters were examined on 28 day daily dosing of rats with nano- or micro-particle encapsulated cyclosporine (CsA) to confirm if any changes observed were drug or carrier dependent. CsA encapsulated poly(lactide-co-glycolide) [PLGA] nano- (nCsA) and micro-particles (mCsA) were prepared by emulsion techniques. CsA (15, 30, 45 mg/kg) were administered by oral gavage to Sprague Dawley (SD) rats over 28 days. Haematological and biochemical metrics were followed with tissue histology performed on sacrifice. Whether presented as nCsA or mCsA, 45 mg/kg dose caused significant loss of body weight and lowered food consumption compared to untreated control. Across the doses, both nCsA and mCsA produce significant decreases in lymphocyte numbers compared to controls, commensurate with the proprietary product, Neoral((R)) 15. Dosing with nCsA showed higher serum drug levels than mCsA presumably owing to the smaller particle size facilitating absorption. The treatment had no noticeable effects on inflammatory/oxidative stress markers or antioxidant enzyme levels, except an increase in ceruloplasmin (CP) levels for high dose nCsA/mCsA group. Further, only subtle, sub-lethal changes were observed in histology of nCsA/mCsA treated rat organs. Blank (drug-free) particles did not induce changes in the parameters studied. Therefore, it is extremely important that the encapsulated drug in the nano-products is considered when safety of the overall product is assessed rather than relying on just the particle size. This study has addressed some concerns surrounding particulate drug delivery, demonstrating safe delivery of CsA whilst achieving augmented serum concentrations.","['Venkatpurwar, V P', 'Rhodes, S', 'Oien, K A', 'Elliott, M A', 'Tekwe, C D', 'Jorgensen, H G', 'Kumar, M N V Ravi']","['Venkatpurwar VP', 'Rhodes S', 'Oien KA', 'Elliott MA', 'Tekwe CD', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Kumar MN']","['Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, G4 0RE, UK.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK, G12 0ZD."", 'Molecular Pathology, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK, G61 1BD.', 'Cancer Research UK Formulation Unit, Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, G4 0RE, UK.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, 1266 Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843-1266, USA.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK, G12 0ZD."", 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, Texas A&M Health Science Centre, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX 77843-1114, USA.

Intensive studies revealed that Notch pathway plays an important role in the invasion of tumor cells. Notch pathway can be triggered by binding of Notch receptors on T-ALL cells to their ligands on bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), which contributes to the development of T-ALL. However, the effect and molecular mechanisms of BMSCs in invasion of T-ALL cells remain unclear. To explore the effect of Notch-1 on the invasiveness of T-ALL cells, we co-cultured T-ALL cells with BMSCs (from healthy donors)/BMSCs() (from newly diagnosed T-ALL patients). The results demonstrated that BMSCs/BMSCs() promoted invasion of T-ALL cells through activating Notch-1 signaling. In particular, T-ALL cells showed a higher invasive potential in the presence of BMSCs() than BMSCs. Knockdown of Notch-1 prevented the positive effect of stromal cells-mediated invasion. Our study also showed that BMSCs/BMSCs()-induced Notch-1 activation increased the expression of matrix metalloprote inase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloprote inase-9 (MMP-9), which increased invasiveness.

Building or renovation works have been shown as one of the major causes of outbreaks of aspergillosis. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of introduction and adaptation by air sampling of mechanical preventive measures on the incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in neutropenic patients during hospital renovation. PATIENTS: All of the patients admitted for prolonged and severe neutropenia during a renovation period from 2003 to 2008 were prospectively enrolled. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) cases were classified as possible, probable, and proven, according to the 2008 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) Consensus Group criteria. The effectiveness of preventive measures was determined by air sampling. RESULTS: We recorded 705 hospitalizations for neutropenia concerning 438 patients. The majority of hospitalized neutropenic patients was treated for acute leukemia (38.3 %), followed by patients suffering from non-Hodgkin and Hodgkin lymphomas (33 %). The total cumulative incidence of probable and proven IPA was 4.1 %. Risk factors for developing IPA were underlying disease, treatment course at the time of hospitalization, and the mean duration of hospitalization and of neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, the incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis did not increase in neutropenic patients during a renovation period because of efficient mechanical preventive measures systematically adjusted using the results of air sampling.","['Loschi, Michael', 'Thill, Caroline', 'Gray, Christian', 'David, Marion', 'Bagatha, Marie-France', 'Chamseddine, Ali', 'Contentin, Nathalie', 'Jardin, Fabrice', 'Lanic, Helene', 'Lemasle, Emilie', 'Lenain, Pascal', 'Stamatoullas, Aspasia', 'Tilly, Herve', 'Lepretre, Stephane']","['Loschi M', 'Thill C', 'Gray C', 'David M', 'Bagatha MF', 'Chamseddine A', 'Contentin N', 'Jardin F', 'Lanic H', 'Lemasle E', 'Lenain P', 'Stamatoullas A', 'Tilly H', 'Lepretre S']","[""Department of Hematology, Centre Henri Becquerel, 1 rue d'Amiens, 76000, Rouen, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150131,Netherlands,Mycopathologia,Mycopathologia,7505689,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Air Microbiology', 'Aspergillus/*isolation & purification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Hospital Design and Construction', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infection Control/*methods', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/*epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/02/01 06:00,2016/01/28 06:00,['2015/02/01 06:00'],"['2014/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11046-015-9865-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Mycopathologia. 2015 Jun;179(5-6):337-45. doi: 10.1007/s11046-015-9865-6.

Treatment with MTX may cause neurotoxicity, which is often accompanied by neurologic changes, delays in treatment, and prolonged hospital stays. This article reports clinical presentations of 3 patients with severe MTX toxicity as well as levels of oxidative stress and apoptosis biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Oxidative stress was measured by oxidized phosphatidylcholine (PC), oxidized phosphatidylinositol (PI), and F2 isoprostanes; apoptosis was measured by caspase 3/7 activity. Most consistent biomarker changes in all 3 cases were increases in caspase 3/7 and F2 isoprostanes prior to acute toxicity while increases in oxidized phospholipids occurred slightly later. Progressive increases in F2 isoprostanes and caspase 3/7 activity prior to and/or during acute toxicity suggests MTX induces oxidative stress and an associated increase in apoptosis. These findings support the role of oxidative stress in MTX-related neurotoxicity.","['Taylor, Olga A', 'Hockenberry, Marilyn J', 'McCarthy, Kathy', 'Gundy, Patricia', 'Montgomery, David', 'Ross, Adam', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Moore, Ida M']","['Taylor OA', 'Hockenberry MJ', 'McCarthy K', 'Gundy P', 'Montgomery D', 'Ross A', 'Scheurer ME', 'Moore IM']","['Baylor College of Medicine Houston, TX, USA oataylor@txch.org.', 'Duke School of Nursing, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Baylor College of Medicine Houston, TX, USA.', 'University of Arizona College of Nursing, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Southern Arizona VA Health Care System, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'University of Arizona College of Nursing, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Baylor College of Medicine Houston, TX, USA.', 'University of Arizona College of Nursing, Tucson, AZ, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 NR010889/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01NR010889/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150130,United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid/*toxicity', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/nursing', 'Severity of Illness Index']",PMC4520788,['NIHMS683478'],2015/02/01 06:00,2016/09/20 06:00,['2015/02/01 06:00'],"['2015/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1043454214563409 [pii]', '10.1177/1043454214563409 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2015 Sep-Oct;32(5):320-5. doi: 10.1177/1043454214563409.

In the present study, we searched for combination therapies with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ235) in RMS. Here, we identify a synthetic lethal interaction of BEZ235 together with the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine (CQ), which is effective against embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS). BEZ235 and CQ at subtoxic concentrations synergize to induce apoptosis in ERMS cells, as confirmed by calculation of combination index (CI). BEZ235 and CQ cooperate to activate caspase-9, -3 and -8, which is crucial for apoptosis induction given that the broad-range caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) blocks BEZ235/CQ-induced apoptosis. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of lysosomal enzymes significantly reduces BEZ235/CQ-induced apoptosis, indicating concomitant activation of the lysosomal compartment. Importantly, BEZ235/CQ-induced apoptosis is significantly inhibited by antioxidants, implying that increased oxidative stress contributes to BEZ235/CQ-induced cell death. Importantly, our molecular studies reveal that BEZ235/CQ-induced apoptosis is mediated by cooperative downregulation of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family protein MCL-1, since stabilization of MCL-1 by expression of a non-degradable MCL-1 phospho-defective mutant significantly decreases BEZ235/CQ-induced apoptosis. Also, overexpression of antiapoptotic BCL-2 leads to a significant reduction of BEZ235/CQ-induced apoptosis, emphasizing that an intact mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is required for BEZ235/CQ-induced cell death. This identification of a synthetic lethality of BEZ235 and CQ has important implications for the development of molecular targeted therapies for RMS.","['Hugle, Manuela', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Hugle M', 'Fulda S']","['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstr. 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Komturstr. 3a, 60528 Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.

We used data from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and performed a matched pair analysis on 188 T-cell-replete haploidentical and 356 autologous transplants done from January 2007 to December 2012, using age, diagnosis, disease status, cytogenetics, and interval from diagnosis to transplant as matching factors. ""Haploidentical expert"" centers were defined as having reported more than five haploidentical transplants for acute leukemia (median value for the study period). The median follow-up was 28 months. Multivariate analyses, including type of transplant categorized into three classes (""haploidentical regular"", ""haploidentical expert"" and autologous), conditioning intensity (reduced intensity versus myeloablative conditioning) and the random effect taking into account associations related to matching, showed that non-relapse mortality was higher following haploidentical transplants in expert (HR: 4.7; P=0.00004) and regular (HR: 8.98; P<10(-5)) centers. Relapse incidence for haploidentical transplants was lower in expert centers (HR:0.39; P=0.0003) but in regular centers was similar to that for autologous transplants. Leukemia-free survival and overall survival rates were higher following autologous transplantation than haploidentical transplants in regular centers (HR: 1.63; P=0.008 and HR: 2.31; P=0.0002 respectively) but similar to those following haploidentical transplants in expert centers. We conclude that autologous stem cell transplantation should presently be considered as a possible alternative to haploidentical transplantation in regular centers that have not developed a specific expert program.","['Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Piemontese, Simona', 'Arcese, William', 'Santarone, Stella', 'Huang, He', 'Meloni, Giovanna', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Sanz, Miguel', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Mailhol, Audrey', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Gorin NC', 'Labopin M', 'Piemontese S', 'Arcese W', 'Santarone S', 'Huang H', 'Meloni G', 'Ferrara F', 'Beelen D', 'Sanz M', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Ciceri F', 'Mailhol A', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['APHP, Acute Leukemia Working Party-EBMT and Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France Sorbonne Universites, UPMC University Paris 06, France INSERM UMR-S 938, Paris, France norbert-claude.gorin@sat.aphp.fr.', 'APHP, Acute Leukemia Working Party-EBMT and Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France Sorbonne Universites, UPMC University Paris 06, France INSERM UMR-S 938, Paris, France.', 'APHP, Acute Leukemia Working Party-EBMT and Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France Ospedale San Raffaele s.r.l.

However, cranial nerve impairment, including facial nerve damage, is rare in patients with HTLV-1 infection. OBSERVATION: We report the case of a patient, originally from Caribbean islands, who developed recurrent bilateral facial palsy (six recurrences during the 7-year follow-up). Both blood and cerebrospinal fluid serologies were positive for HTLV-1. The diagnosis of recurring bilateral facial palsy revealing HTLV-1 infection was made. CONCLUSION: Our case report underscores that HTLV-1 infection should be considered in patients, coming from endemic areas (Caribbean islands, South America, Japan and Africa), who exhibit recurrent bilateral facial palsy. Our data therefore indicate that HTLV-1 serology should be routinely performed in these patients.","['Leclercq, M', 'Sauvetre, G', 'Levesque, H', 'Marie, I']","['Leclercq M', 'Sauvetre G', 'Levesque H', 'Marie I']","['Departement de medecine interne, CHU de Rouen, 1, rue de Germont, 76031 Rouen cedex, France.', 'Departement de medecine interne, CHU de Rouen, 1, rue de Germont, 76031 Rouen cedex, France.', 'Departement de medecine interne, CHU de Rouen, 1, rue de Germont, 76031 Rouen cedex, France.', 'Departement de medecine interne, CHU de Rouen, 1, rue de Germont, 76031 Rouen cedex, France.

Ribonucleotide reductase (RR; EC 1.17.4.1) converts ribonucleoside diphosphates into deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates being essential for DNA replication, which is why the enzyme is considered an excellent target for anticancer therapy. EGCG, EA, and RA dose-dependently inhibited the growth of human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, exerted strong free radical scavenging potential, and significantly imbalanced nuclear deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) concentrations without distinctly affecting the protein levels of RR subunits (R1, R2, p53R2). Incorporation of (14)C-cytidine into nascent DNA of tumor cells was also significantly lowered, being equivalent to an inhibition of DNA synthesis. Consequently, treatment with EGCG and RA attenuated cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, finally resulting in a pronounced induction of apoptosis. Sequential combination of EA and RA with the first-line antileukemic agent arabinofuranosylcytosine (AraC) synergistically potentiated the antiproliferative effect of AraC, whereas EGCG plus AraC yielded additive effects. Taken together, we show for the first time that EGCG, EA, and RA perturbed dNTP levels and inhibited cell proliferation in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, with EGCG and RA causing a pronounced induction of apoptosis. Due to these effects and synergism with AraC, these food ingredients deserve further preclinical and in vivo testing as inhibitors of leukemic cell proliferation.","['Saiko, Philipp', 'Steinmann, Marie-Therese', 'Schuster, Heike', 'Graser, Geraldine', 'Bressler, Sabine', 'Giessrigl, Benedikt', 'Lackner, Andreas', 'Grusch, Michael', 'Krupitza, Georg', 'Bago-Horvath, Zsuzsanna', 'Jaeger, Walter', 'Fritzer-Szekeres, Monika', 'Szekeres, Thomas']","['Saiko P', 'Steinmann MT', 'Schuster H', 'Graser G', 'Bressler S', 'Giessrigl B', 'Lackner A', 'Grusch M', 'Krupitza G', 'Bago-Horvath Z', 'Jaeger W', 'Fritzer-Szekeres M', 'Szekeres T']","['Department of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Cancer Research, Medical University of Vienna, Borschkegasse 8a, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Cancer Research, Medical University of Vienna, Borschkegasse 8a, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Diagnostics, University of Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.

We conducted a comprehensive assessment of risks of second cancer according to RT technique (>10 MV vs </=10 MV and 3-dimensional [3D] vs 2D RT) and modality (external beam RT, brachytherapy, and combined modes) in a large cohort of prostate cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cohort was constructed using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database. We included cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in patients 66 to 84 years of age from 1992 to 2004 and followed through 2009. We used Poisson regression analysis to compare rates of second cancer across RT groups with adjustment for age, follow-up, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and comorbidities. Analyses of second solid cancers were based on the number of 5-year survivors (n=38,733), and analyses of leukemia were based on number of 2-year survivors (n=52,515) to account for the minimum latency period for radiation-related cancer. RESULTS: During an average of 4.4 years' follow-up among 5-year prostate cancer survivors (2DRT = 5.5 years; 3DRT = 3.9 years; and brachytherapy = 2.7 years), 2933 second solid cancers were diagnosed. There were no significant differences in second solid cancer rates overall between 3DRT and 2DRT patients (relative risk [RR] = 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91-1.09), but second rectal cancer rates were significantly lower after 3DRT (RR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.40-0.88). Rates of second solid cancers for higher- and lower-energy RT were similar overall (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.89-1.06), as were rates for site-specific cancers. There were significant reductions in colon cancer and leukemia rates in the first decade after brachytherapy compared to those after external beam RT. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced treatment planning may have reduced rectal cancer risks in prostate cancer survivors by approximately 3 cases per 1000 after 15 years. Despite concerns about the neutron doses, we did not find evidence that higher energy therapy was associated with increased second cancer risks.","['Berrington de Gonzalez, Amy', 'Wong, Jeannette', 'Kleinerman, Ruth', 'Kim, Clara', 'Morton, Lindsay', 'Bekelman, Justin E']","['Berrington de Gonzalez A', 'Wong J', 'Kleinerman R', 'Kim C', 'Morton L', 'Bekelman JE']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.

Levels of IL-6 are increased in serum of CLL patients and correlated with adverse clinical features and short survival. In our study, we observed that IL-6 induced the resistance of CLL cells to pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors vorinostat (SAHA) and panobinostat (LBH589). Furthermore, low concentrations of SAHA and LBH589 enhanced the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway induced by IL-6 in CLL cells. All of these effects were blocked by the STAT3-selective inhibitor, WP1066. Meanwhile, WP1066 decreased the expressions of Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL protein induced by IL-6 with or without low concentrations of HDAC inhibitors. Co-culture of CLL cells with BMSCs could also facilitate the activation of STAT3 and protected CLL cells from apoptosis when treated with HDAC inhibitors, and this cytoprotection was reversed by WP1066. The present study indicated that IL-6 or co-culture with BMSCs prevented HDAC inhibitor-induced apoptosis of CLL cells. This prevention was mediated by activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. Moreover, WP1066 reversed the resistance of CLL cells to SAHA and LBH589 induced by either IL-6 or co-culture with BMSCs.

Molecular studies show the possibility of involvement of certain cancer pathways in gastric cancer. In this respect, DNA methylation is one of the most important epigenetic alterations in gastric cancer and identifying the signaling mechanism and also methylation of some genes that are involved in gastric cancer can help to improve treatment strategies. Relatively, there are many reported methylation alteration of genes in stem cells in all kinds of tumors with some of these genes having a key role in tumor development. Correspondingly, KLF5, CDX1/2, WNT1 and FEM1A are considerable genes in gastric cancer, although many researches and studies have illustrated that sonic hedgehog and expression of its signaling cascade proteins are related in gastric cancer. Relatively, modification in these genes causes many eclectic cancers such as rhabdomyosarcoma and diverse kinds of digestive system tumor development. Conspicuously, these master genes have a noticeable role in stem cell's growth regulation as well as other kinds of cancer such as breast cancer and leukemia. Hence, we concluded that research and studies on methylation and expression of these genes and also the investigation of molecular signaling in gastric cancer can acquire impressive conclusions in order to control and treat this common place and serious problem.","['Samadani, Ali Akbar', 'Akhavan-Niaki, Haleh']","['Samadani AA', 'Akhavan-Niaki H']","['Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150131,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,IM,"['DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hedgehog Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology/*physiology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology']",,,2015/02/01 06:00,2016/04/26 06:00,['2015/02/01 06:00'],"['2014/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/02/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/02/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-015-0492-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2015 Mar;32(3):48. doi: 10.1007/s12032-015-0492-3.

This translocation is also called Philadelphia chromosome and encodes the BCR/ABL oncogene, a constitutive active tyrosine kinase. BCR/ABL renders hematopoietic cells independent from exogenous growth-stimulatory signals by continuously engaging signaling pathways including JAK-STAT signaling and the MAPK pathway. The enforced expression of BCR/ABL suffices to transform hematopoietic cells which made it to one of the best studied model systems in the field.

Early insertion increases convenience, but might increase infection rates. METHODS: We assessed retrospectively the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) according to CVC time of insertion in patients with acute leukemia admitted for induction or salvage therapy. The study was conducted in the Hematology Department of a Tertiary hospital in Israel between 2007 and 2011. Early CVC placement was defined as CVC inserted during the first week of induction therapy. CLABSI rate was documented between the seventh day of induction therapy to 30 days after its completion. RESULTS: A total of 127 patients were included. Acute myeloid leukemia was the most common diagnosis (103 patients, 80.5%). Late CVC placement was associated with CLABSI after adjustment to the Charlson comorbidity index (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.1-10.45), p=0.03. CONCLUSION: Delaying CVC placement in adult patients with acute leukemia may be associated with higher rate of CLABSI in the early period after induction therapy.","['Kugler, Eitan', 'Levi, Amos', 'Goldberg, Elad', 'Zaig, Eli', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Paul, Mical']","['Kugler E', 'Levi A', 'Goldberg E', 'Zaig E', 'Raanani P', 'Paul M']","['Department of Medicine F-Recanati, Beilinson Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.

Forty patients (11.8%) progressed to leukemia, with a resulting 10-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) rates of 72%. Hb (<10g/dL), and circulating blasts (>/=1%) were the only two independent prognostic for LT at the multivariate analysis. Two hundred-fifty patients with both the two parameters available were grouped as follows: low risk (none or one factor)=216 patients; high risk (both factors)=31 patients. The median LFS times were 269 and 45 months for the low and high-risk groups, respectively (P<.0001). The LT predictive power of these two parameters was confirmed in an external series of 270 PMF patients from Tuscany, in whom the median LFS was not reached and 61 months for the low and high risk groups, respectively (P<.0001). These results establish anemia and circulating blasts, two easily and universally available parameters, as strong predictors of LT in PMF and may help to improve prognostic stratification of these patients particularly in countries with low resources where more sophisticated molecular testing is unavailable.","['Rago, Angela', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Montanaro, Marco', 'Montefusco, Enrico', 'Andriani, Alessandro', 'Crescenzi, Sabrina Leonetti', 'Mecarocci, Sergio', 'Spirito, Francesca', 'Spadea, Antonio', 'Recine, Umberto', 'Cicconi, Laura', 'Avvisati, Giuseppe', 'Cedrone, Michele', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Porrini, Raffaele', 'Villiva, Nicoletta', 'De Gregoris, Cinzia', 'Alimena, Giuliana', ""D'Arcangelo, Enzo"", 'Guglielmelli, Paola', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro', 'Cimino, Giuseppe']","['Rago A', 'Latagliata R', 'Montanaro M', 'Montefusco E', 'Andriani A', 'Crescenzi SL', 'Mecarocci S', 'Spirito F', 'Spadea A', 'Recine U', 'Cicconi L', 'Avvisati G', 'Cedrone M', 'Breccia M', 'Porrini R', 'Villiva N', 'De Gregoris C', 'Alimena G', ""D'Arcangelo E"", 'Guglielmelli P', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Vannucchi A', 'Cimino G']","['Hematology Unit (2U) ICOT/S, Maria Goretti Hospital, AUSL Latina, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, University of Rome ""Sapienza"", Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Belcolle Hospital, Viterbo, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, S.

Clinical reports observe the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) in people who have recovered from arsenic poisoning and in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia that have been treated with arsenic trioxide. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association between arsenic and the seroprevalence of VZV IgG antibody in a representative sample of the U.S. METHODS: We analyzed data from 3,348 participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2004 and 2009-2010 pooled survey cycles. Participants were eligible if they were 6-49 years of age with information on both VZV IgG and urinary arsenic concentrations. We used two measures of total urinary arsenic (TUA): TUA1 was defined as the sum of arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid, and dimethylarsinic acid, and TUA2 was defined as total urinary arsenic minus arsenobetaine and arsenocholine. RESULTS: The overall weighted seronegative prevalence of VZV was 2.2% for the pooled NHANES sample. The geometric means of TUA1 and TUA2 were 6.57 mug/L and 5.64 mug/L, respectively. After adjusting for age, sex, race, income, creatinine, and survey cycle, odds ratios for a negative VZV IgG result in association with 1-unit increases in natural log-transformed (ln)-TUA1 and ln-TUA2 were 1.87 (95% CI: 1.03, 3.44) and 1.40 (95% CI: 1.0, 1.97), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional analysis, urinary arsenic was inversely associated with VZV IgG seroprevalence in the U.S. POPULATION: This finding is in accordance with clinical observations of zoster virus reactivation from high doses of arsenic.

However, 40-45% of these patients eventually relapse and die of their disease. Here, we review emerging molecular and therapeutic results that may be used to guide the clinical management of this subset of patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Integration of cytogenetic results with molecular genetic and epigenetic data refines the diagnosis, classification and risk-stratification of CBF AML. Clinical studies with targeting compounds (e.g. gemtuzumab ozogamicin, dasatinib) added to intensive chemotherapy appear beneficial both in younger and older patients, albeit the latter continue to have a significantly worse outcome than the former. Regularly molecular monitoring of disease during remission may provide a strategy for early therapeutic intervention before overt relapse.

On the basis of these studies, a phase 1 clinical trial has been initiated targeting the histone methyltransferase DOT1L with interim clinical results reported at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2014. SUMMARY: Acute leukaemia, both myeloid and lymphoid, that harbours a translocation involving the MLL gene at chromosome locus 11q23 has a poor prognosis, even with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The pathogenesis of MLL translocated leukaemias has recently been linked to aberrant activity of the histone methyltransferase DOT1. Preclinical studies of DOT1L inhibition with potent, selective inhibitors have shown successful eradication of the leukaemic clone in animal models.

Of these, myelofibrosis often has the most aggressive course. There is, however, often significant clinical heterogeneity among patients with myelofibrosis. We seek to summarize recent clinical and biological findings in myelofibrosis as well as review the spectrum of clinically relevant mutation in myelofibrosis and their implications. RECENT FINDINGS: The mutational spectrum in myelofibrosis includes driver mutations in genes such as JAK2, calreticulin, and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene. In addition, recurrent mutations in epigenetic modifiers such as ASXL1 and TET2 have also been described. Importantly, several studies have indicated that specific mutations, as well as the number of mutations, that a patient bears may have important clinical consequences. The presence or absence of certain mutations may help to determine a patient's risk for thrombosis, leukemic transformation, and survival. SUMMARY: Myelofibrosis often has variable outcomes among patients. Prognostic systems based on clinical observations have been developed in an attempt to predict risks of disease progression and transformation. The discovery of recurrent genomic alterations in myelofibrosis, and the observation that many of these alterations may help predict clinical outcomes, has heralded a new era in the biologic understanding and clinical approach to myelofibrosis.","['Hobbs, Gabriela S', 'Rampal, Raajit K']","['Hobbs GS', 'Rampal RK']","['aLeukemia Service, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts bLeukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",,,2015/01/31 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,['2015/01/31 06:00'],"['2015/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000122 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2015 Mar;22(2):177-83. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000122.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our goal was to develop a robust 3-dimensional (3D) endocervix model that was a reliable representation of the in vivo tissues and to identify the physiological responses to changing levels of steroid hormones during a 28-day time period. Human endocervical cells were grown on polystyrene scaffolds, and the morphologic and hormonal responses of cultured cells were assessed in response to fluctuating levels of estradiol (E2) or progesterone (P4). Morphologically, the 3D cultures were composed of a mixed population of cells, including epithelial and stromal cells. Treatment with E2 and P4 (d 28) increased cell growth and proliferation as compared with no treatment control. Cells expressed estrogen receptor and P4 receptor and produced both neutral and acidic mucins, including Mucin 16. In addition, a 45-plex Luminex assay identified numerous factors secreted and regulated by hormones. Specifically, IL-1beta and leukemia inhibitory factor significantly decreased in the presence of E2 and P4 as compared with the no hormone control at day 26. Cotreatment with RU486 (mifepristone) attenuated the inhibition of IL-1beta and leukemia inhibitory factor secretion. In summary, a robust, novel 3D endocervical culture was developed, and physiologic responses to the menstrual cycle mimic of E2 and P4 levels for a period of 28 days were identified.","['Arslan, Sevim Yildiz', 'Yu, Yanni', 'Burdette, Joanne E', 'Pavone, Mary Ellen', 'Hope, Thomas J', 'Woodruff, Teresa K', 'Kim, J Julie']","['Arslan SY', 'Yu Y', 'Burdette JE', 'Pavone ME', 'Hope TJ', 'Woodruff TK', 'Kim JJ']","['Division of Reproductive Science in Medicine (S.Y.A., Y.Y., M.E.P., T.K.W., J.J.K.), Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Department of Cell and Molecular Biology (T.J.H.), Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 60611; Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy (J.E.B.), University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60607; and Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility (M.E.P.), Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 60611.']",['eng'],"['UH2ES022920/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'UH3TR001207/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R33 AI094584/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI082971/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HD028934/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'UH2 ES022920/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'UH3 TR001207/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150130,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cervix Uteri/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Estradiol/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Progesterone/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4399320,,2015/01/31 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2015/01/31 06:00'],"['2015/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1210/en.2014-1840 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 2015 Apr;156(4):1602-9. doi: 10.1210/en.2014-1840.

METHODS: Newly diagnosed esophageal cancer patients between 1997 and 2011 were recruited. To avoid surveillance bias, SPMs that developed within one year were excluded. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of metachronous SPMs in these patients were calculated by comparing to the cancer incidence in the general population. Risk factors for SPM development, included age, sex, comorbidities and cancer-related treatments, were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: During the 15-year study period, 870 SPMs developed among 18,026 esophageal cancer patients, with a follow-up of 27,056 person-years. The SIR for all cancers was 3.53. The SIR of follow-up period >/= 10 years was 3.56; 5-10 years, 3.14; and 1-5 years, 3.06. The cancer SIRs of head and neck (15.83), stomach (3.30), lung and mediastinum (2.10), kidney (2.24) and leukemia (2.72), were significantly increased. Multivariate analysis showed that age >/= 60 years (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74), being male (HR 1.46) and liver cirrhosis (HR 1.46) were independent factors. According to the treatments, major surgery (HR 1.24) increased the risk, but chemotherapy was nearly significant. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with esophageal cancer were at increased risk of developing metachronous SPMs. The SIR remained high in follow-up > 10 years, so that close monitoring may be needed for early detection of SPM among these esophageal cancer patients.","['Chen, San-Chi', 'Teng, Chung-Jen', 'Hu, Yu-Wen', 'Yeh, Chiu-Mei', 'Hung, Man-Hsin', 'Hu, Li-Yu', 'Ku, Fan-Chen', 'Tzeng, Cheng-Hwai', 'Chiou, Tzeon-Jye', 'Chen, Tzeng-Ji', 'Liu, Chia-Jen']","['Chen SC', 'Teng CJ', 'Hu YW', 'Yeh CM', 'Hung MH', 'Hu LY', 'Ku FC', 'Tzeng CH', 'Chiou TJ', 'Chen TJ', 'Liu CJ']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Cancer Center, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Family Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Changhua Show-Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Family Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan; Institute of Public Health, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['HIR 10-001/HX/HSRD VA/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150130,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4312084,,2015/01/31 06:00,2015/10/07 06:00,['2015/01/31 06:00'],"['2014/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0116384 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-22801 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Jan 30;10(1):e0116384. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0116384. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of its repertoire of adaptive responses, two-component regulatory systems play a major role in co-ordinating gene expression at the global level. The PhoPR system controls major cellular functions, including respiration, lipid metabolism, the immediate and enduring hypoxic responses, stress responses and persistence. We identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) found in the sensor kinase (PhoR) of this system between two commonly used strains of M. tuberculosis, H37Rv (PhoR(P152)) and CDC1551 (PhoR(L152)). We constructed an isogenic strain of H37Rv carrying PhoR(L152), as well as strains containing two different copies of the PhoPR locus, to determine the functional consequences of the SNP on phenotypic traits. The previously identified Apr locus was not acid-inducible in H37Rv, although it was in the CDC1551 strain. Surprisingly, the acid-responsive expression was not completely dependent on the PhoR SNP, and the locus remained constitutively expressed even in the isogenic strain H37Rv:PhoR(L152). The pattern of expression in PhoPR merodiploid strains was more complex, with neither allele showing dominance. This suggests that Apr regulation is more complex than previously thought and that additional factors must be responsible for Apr upregulation in response to acid conditions. In contrast, differences we identified in cell hydrophobicity between the two strains were wholly dependent on PhoR, confirming its role as major regulator of cell wall composition. Thus the SNP in the sensor kinase has functional consequences which account for some of the differences between widely used laboratory strains.","['Schreuder, L J', 'Carroll, P', 'Muwanguzi-Karugaba, J', 'Kokoczka, Rachel', 'Brown, Amanda C', 'Parish, T']","['Schreuder LJ', 'Carroll P', 'Muwanguzi-Karugaba J', 'Kokoczka R', 'Brown AC', 'Parish T']","['1Queen Mary University of London, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.', '1Queen Mary University of London, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.', '1Queen Mary University of London, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.', '2TB Discovery Research, Infectious Disease Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA.', '1Queen Mary University of London, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.', '2TB Discovery Research, Infectious Disease Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA.', '1Queen Mary University of London, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150129,England,Microbiology (Reading),"Microbiology (Reading, England)",9430468,IM,"['Alleles', 'Bacterial Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Wall/chemistry/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial', 'Genetic Loci', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",,,2015/01/31 06:00,2016/03/15 06:00,['2015/01/31 06:00'],"['2014/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/mic.0.000036 [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiology (Reading). 2015 Apr;161(Pt 4):765-773. doi: 10.1099/mic.0.000036.

Currently, chemotherapy and differentiating agents have been used for the treatment of leukemia. Recently, plant extracts, either alone or in combination with chemo agents, have been proposed to be used for the treatment of cancers. The aim of the present research was to study the cytotoxicity and apoptosis effects of an active licorice-derived compound, glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), on human leukemic HL60 cells. HL60 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated with different doses of GA and their viability and proliferation were detected by dye exclusion and 3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assays. Apoptosis induction and expression of CD95 and CD178 were analyzed by flow cytometry. We observed that GA decreases cell viability and suppresses cells proliferation in a dose- dependent manner. In addition, our flow cytometry data show that GA not only induces apoptosis in HL60 cells, but also upregulates both CD95 and CD178 expression on the cell surface of these cells in a dose-dependent manner. The combination of GA with cytotoxic drugs and differentiation agents requires further investigation.","['Pirzadeh, Sara', 'Fakhari, Shohreh', 'Jalili, Ali', 'Mirzai, Sako', 'Ghaderi, Bayazeed', 'Haghshenas, Venous']","['Pirzadeh S', 'Fakhari S', 'Jalili A', 'Mirzai S', 'Ghaderi B', 'Haghshenas V']","['Department of Biochemistry, Research & Development, Islamic Azad University, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Kurdistan Cellular & Molecular Research Center, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Kurdistan Cellular & Molecular Research Center, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Research & Development, Islamic Azad University, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Kurdistan Cellular & Molecular Research Center, Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences, Sanandaj, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Research & Development, Islamic Azad University, Sanandaj, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Mol Cell Med,International journal of molecular and cellular medicine,101598104,,,PMC4293615,,2015/01/31 06:00,2015/01/31 06:01,['2015/01/31 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/31 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Cell Med. 2014 Fall;3(4):272-8.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'cytotoxicity', 'glycyrrhetinic acid']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known regarding the physiological roles of microRNAs in the regulation of embryo implantation. Here we show that a minimum uterine expression of miR-181 is essential for the onset of embryo implantation. Both transient and prolonged transgenic expression of miR-181 led to impaired implantation, which can be rescued by exogenous administration of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Mechanistically, miR-181 is able to directly target LIF and downregulate LIF expression, thereby inhibiting embryo implantation. We also show that miR-181 expression is regulated by the transcriptional factor Emx2, and the Emx2-miR-181 axis plays an important role in regulating embryo implantation. Taken together, these results reveal a novel function of miR-181 in embryo implantation through the regulation of LIF, and also indicate a potential link between miR-181 dysregulation and human embryo implantation defects.","['Chu, Bo', 'Zhong, Liangwen', 'Dou, Shuang', 'Wang, Jun', 'Li, Jianmin', 'Wang, Mingwei', 'Shi, Qinghua', 'Mei, Yide', 'Wu, Mian']","['Chu B', 'Zhong L', 'Dou S', 'Wang J', 'Li J', 'Wang M', 'Shi Q', 'Mei Y', 'Wu M']","['CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Innovation Center for Cell Biology, School of Life Sciences and Medical Center, University of Science & Technology of China, Hefei 230027, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Innovation Center for Cell Biology, School of Life Sciences and Medical Center, University of Science & Technology of China, Hefei 230027, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Innovation Center for Cell Biology, School of Life Sciences and Medical Center, University of Science & Technology of China, Hefei 230027, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Innovation Center for Cell Biology, School of Life Sciences and Medical Center, University of Science & Technology of China, Hefei 230027, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Innovation Center for Cell Biology, School of Life Sciences and Medical Center, University of Science & Technology of China, Hefei 230027, China qshi@ustc.edu.cn meiyide@ustc.edu.cn wumian@ustc.edu.cn.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Innovation Center for Cell Biology, School of Life Sciences and Medical Center, University of Science & Technology of China, Hefei 230027, China qshi@ustc.edu.cn meiyide@ustc.edu.cn wumian@ustc.edu.cn.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Innate Immunity and Chronic Disease, Innovation Center for Cell Biology, School of Life Sciences and Medical Center, University of Science & Technology of China, Hefei 230027, China qshi@ustc.edu.cn meiyide@ustc.edu.cn wumian@ustc.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150129,United States,J Mol Cell Biol,Journal of molecular cell biology,101503669,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Birth Rate', 'Cell Line', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Down-Regulation', 'Embryo Implantation/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/chemistry/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/*genetics', 'Phenotype', '*RNA Interference', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2015/01/31 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2015/01/31 06:00'],"['2015/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['mjv006 [pii]', '10.1093/jmcb/mjv006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Cell Biol. 2015 Feb;7(1):12-22. doi: 10.1093/jmcb/mjv006.

However, the mechanism underlying gastric cancer susceptibility and resistance to YM155 is yet to be specified. Here, we demonstrate that cIAP1 stability dictates resistance to YM155 in human gastric cancer cells. Treatment of human gastric cancer cells with YM155 differentially induced cell death dependent on the stability of cIAP1 as well as survivin. Transfection with cIAP1 expression plasmids decreased cell sensitivity to YM155, whereas knockdown of endogenous cIAP1 using RNA interference enhanced sensitivity to YM155. In addition, double knockdown of survivin and cIAP1 significantly induced cell death in the YM155-resistant cell line, MKN45. We also showed that YM155 induced autoubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of cIAP1. Surprisingly, survivin affected the stability of cIAP1 through binding, contributing to cell sensitivity to YM155. Thus, our findings reveal that YM155 sensitizes human gastric cancer cells to apoptotic cell death by degrading cIAP1, and furthermore, cIAP1 in gastric cancer cells may act as a PD marker for YM155 treatment.","['Jung, Soo-A', 'Park, Yong-Man', 'Hong, Seung-Woo', 'Moon, Jai-Hee', 'Shin, Jae-Sik', 'Lee, Ha-Reum', 'Ha, Seung-Hee', 'Lee, Dae-Hee', 'Kim, Jeong Hee', 'Kim, Seung-Mi', 'Kim, Jeong Eun', 'Kim, Kyu-pyo', 'Hong, Yong Sang', 'Choi, Eun Kyung', 'Lee, Jung Shin', 'Jin, Dong-Hoon', 'Kim, TaeWon']","['Jung SA', 'Park YM', 'Hong SW', 'Moon JH', 'Shin JS', 'Lee HR', 'Ha SH', 'Lee DH', 'Kim JH', 'Kim SM', 'Kim JE', 'Kim KP', 'Hong YS', 'Choi EK', 'Lee JS', 'Jin DH', 'Kim T']","['From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology.', 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology.', 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology.', 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology.', 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology.', ""From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology, the Department of Life Sciences, Sookmyung Women's University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology.', 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology.', 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology.', 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology.', 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology.', 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology.', 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology.', 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Radiation Oncology, and.', 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology.', 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology, Convergence Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, 88 Olympicro-43gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul and inno183@amc.seoul.kr.', 'From the Innovative Cancer Research, Asan Institute for Life Science, Departments of Oncology, twkimmd@amc.seoul.kr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150129,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gastric Mucosa/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Stability', 'Proteolysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survivin', 'Ubiquitination']",PMC4400372,,2015/01/31 06:00,2015/06/20 06:00,['2015/01/31 06:00'],"['2014/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)42651-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.600874 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Apr 17;290(16):9974-85. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.600874.

Likewise, its ortholog, trithorax, is cleaved by Drosophila Taspase1 (dTaspase1), implementing a functional coevolution. To uncover novel mechanism regulating protease function, we performed a functional analysis of dTaspase1 and its comparison to the human ortholog. dTaspase1 contains an essential nucleophile threonine(195), catalyzing cis cleavage into its alpha- and beta-subunits. A cell-based assay combined with alanine scanning mutagenesis demonstrated that the target cleavage motif for dTaspase1 (Q(3)[F/I/L/M](2)D(1) downward arrowG(1')X(2')X(3')) differs significantly from the human ortholog (Q(3)[F,I,L,V](2)D(1) downward arrowG(1')x(2')D(3')D(4')), predicting an enlarged degradome containing 70 substrates for Drosophila. In contrast to human Taspase1, dTaspase1 shows no discrete localization to the nucleus/nucleolus due to the lack of the importin-alpha/nucleophosmin1 interaction domain (NoLS) conserved in all vertebrates. Consequently, dTaspase1 interacts with neither the Drosophila nucleoplasmin-like protein nor human nucleophosmin1. The impact of localization on the protease's degradome was confirmed by demonstrating that dTaspase1 did not efficiently process nuclear substrates, such as upstream stimulatory factor 2. However, genetic introduction of the NoLS into dTaspase1 restored its nucleolar localization, nucleophosmin1 interaction, and efficient cleavage of nuclear substrates. We report that evolutionary functional divergence separating vertebrates from invertebrates can be achieved for proteases by a transport/localization-regulated mechanism.","['Wunsch, Desiree', 'Hahlbrock, Angelina', 'Heiselmayer, Christina', 'Backer, Sandra', 'Heun, Patrick', 'Goesswein, Dorothee', 'Stocker, Walter', 'Schirmeister, Tanja', 'Schneider, Gunter', 'Kramer, Oliver H', 'Knauer, Shirley K', 'Stauber, Roland H']","['Wunsch D', 'Hahlbrock A', 'Heiselmayer C', 'Backer S', 'Heun P', 'Goesswein D', 'Stocker W', 'Schirmeister T', 'Schneider G', 'Kramer OH', 'Knauer SK', 'Stauber RH']","['*Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Ear, Nose and Throat Department, University Medical Center of Mainz, Mainz, Germany; Institute for Molecular Biology, Centre for Medical Biotechnology, Mainz Scientific Screening Center UG & Co.

Herein, we show that homozygous deletion of the miR-29a/b-1 bicistron results in decreased numbers of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), decreased HSC self-renewal, and increased HSC cell cycling and apoptosis. The HSPC phenotype is specifically due to loss of miR-29a, because miR-29b expression is unaltered in miR-29a/b-1-null HSCs, and only ectopic expression of miR-29a restores HSPC function both in vitro and in vivo. HSCs lacking miR-29a/b-1 exhibit widespread transcriptional dysregulation and adopt gene expression patterns similar to normal committed progenitors. A number of predicted miR-29 target genes, including Dnmt3a, are significantly upregulated in miR-29a/b-1-null HSCs. The loss of negative regulation of Dnmt3a by miR-29a is a major contributor to the miR-29a/b-1-null HSPC phenotype, as both in vitro Dnmt3a short hairpin RNA knockdown assays and a genetic haploinsufficiency model of Dnmt3a restored the frequency and long-term reconstitution capacity of HSCs from miR-29a/b-1-deficient mice. Overall, these data demonstrate that miR-29a is critical for maintaining HSC function through its negative regulation of Dnmt3a.","['Hu, Wenhuo', 'Dooley, James', 'Chung, Stephen S', 'Chandramohan, Dhruva', 'Cimmino, Luisa', 'Mukherjee, Siddhartha', 'Mason, Christopher E', 'de Strooper, Bart', 'Liston, Adrian', 'Park, Christopher Y']","['Hu W', 'Dooley J', 'Chung SS', 'Chandramohan D', 'Cimmino L', 'Mukherjee S', 'Mason CE', 'de Strooper B', 'Liston A', 'Park CY']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;', 'Autoimmune Genetics Laboratory, Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut Voor Biotechnologie, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium;', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, NY;', 'School of Medicine and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New York University, New York, NY;', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY;', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill-Cornell Medical College, New York, NY;', 'Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut Voor Biotechnologie, Center for the Biology of Disease, Leuven, Belgium; Center for Human Genetics and Leuven Institute for Neuroscience and Disease, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; and.', 'Autoimmune Genetics Laboratory, Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut Voor Biotechnologie, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium;', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA164120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA164120-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150129,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*physiology', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC4383797,,2015/01/31 06:00,2015/06/19 06:00,['2015/01/31 06:00'],"['2014/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31835-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-06-585273 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Apr 2;125(14):2206-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-06-585273.

We reappraised this issue in 8593 CLL patients of whom 437 (5%) used the IGHV3-21 gene with 254/437 (58%) classified as subset #2. Within subset #2, immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV)-mutated cases predominated, whereas non-subset #2/IGHV3-21 was enriched for IGHV-unmutated cases (P = .002). Subset #2 exhibited significantly shorter time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) compared with non-subset #2/IGHV3-21 (22 vs 60 months, P = .001). No such difference was observed between non-subset #2/IGHV3-21 vs the remaining CLL with similar IGHV mutational status. In conclusion, IGHV3-21 CLL should not be axiomatically considered a homogeneous entity with adverse prognosis, given that only subset #2 emerges as uniformly aggressive, contrasting non-subset #2/IGVH3-21 patients whose prognosis depends on IGHV mutational status as the remaining CLL.","['Baliakas, Panagiotis', 'Agathangelidis, Andreas', 'Hadzidimitriou, Anastasia', 'Sutton, Lesley-Ann', 'Minga, Eva', 'Tsanousa, Athina', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Davis, Zadie', 'Yan, Xiao-Jie', 'Shanafelt, Tait', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Sandberg, Yorick', 'Vojdeman, Fie Juhl', 'Boudjogra, Myriam', 'Tzenou, Tatiana', 'Chatzouli, Maria', 'Chu, Charles C', 'Veronese, Silvio', 'Gardiner, Anne', 'Mansouri, Larry', 'Smedby, Karin E', 'Pedersen, Lone Bredo', 'Moreno, Denis', 'Van Lom, Kirsten', 'Giudicelli, Veronique', 'Francova, Hana Skuhrova', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Panagiotidis, Panagiotis', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Angelis, Lefteris', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Lefranc, Marie-Paule', 'Facco, Monica', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Catherwood, Mark', 'Montillo, Marco', 'Geisler, Christian H', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Oscier, David', 'Jelinek, Diane F', 'Darzentas, Nikos', 'Belessi, Chrysoula', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas']","['Baliakas P', 'Agathangelidis A', 'Hadzidimitriou A', 'Sutton LA', 'Minga E', 'Tsanousa A', 'Scarfo L', 'Davis Z', 'Yan XJ', 'Shanafelt T', 'Plevova K', 'Sandberg Y', 'Vojdeman FJ', 'Boudjogra M', 'Tzenou T', 'Chatzouli M', 'Chu CC', 'Veronese S', 'Gardiner A', 'Mansouri L', 'Smedby KE', 'Pedersen LB', 'Moreno D', 'Van Lom K', 'Giudicelli V', 'Francova HS', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Panagiotidis P', 'Juliusson G', 'Angelis L', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Lefranc MP', 'Facco M', 'Trentin L', 'Catherwood M', 'Montillo M', 'Geisler CH', 'Langerak AW', 'Pospisilova S', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Oscier D', 'Jelinek DF', 'Darzentas N', 'Belessi C', 'Davi F', 'Ghia P', 'Rosenquist R', 'Stamatopoulos K']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden;', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy;

As a result, CYP3A5 expressers have a reduced amount of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy than non-expressers. We modeled the structure of CYP3A5 and its interaction with vincristine, compared with CYP3A4-vincristine complex using molecular docking and simulation studies. This relative study helped us to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the interaction at the atomic level through interaction energy, binding free energy, hydrogen bond and solvent accessible surface area analysis - giving an insight into the binding mode and the main residues involved in this particular interaction. Our results show that the interacting groups get closer in CYP3A5-vincristine complex due to different orientation of vincristine. This leads to higher binding affinity of vincristine towards CYP3A5 compared to CYP3A4 and explains the preferential metabolism of vincristine by CYP3A5. We believe that, the results of the current study will be helpful for future studies on structure-based drug design in this area.","['Saba, Nikhat', 'Bhuyan, Rajabrata', 'Nandy, Suman Kumar', 'Seal, Alpana']","['Saba N', 'Bhuyan R', 'Nandy SK', 'Seal A']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Kalyani, Kalyani, West Bengal, India, PIN 741235. aseal@klyuniv.ac.in.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*chemistry', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Vincristine/*chemistry']",,,2015/01/31 06:00,2015/12/22 06:00,['2015/01/31 06:00'],"['2014/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-64881 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520615666150129213510 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2015;15(4):475-83. doi: 10.2174/1871520615666150129213510.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine if endogenous miR-24 is required for hematopoiesis, we antagonized miR-24 in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and performed in vitro differentiations. Suppression of miR-24 resulted in an inability to produce blood and hematopoietic progenitors (HPCs) from ESCs. The phenotype is not a general defect in mesoderm production since we observe production of nascent mesoderm as well as mesoderm derived cardiac muscle and endothelial cells. Results from blast colony forming cell (BL-CFC) assays demonstrate that miR-24 is not required for generation of the hemangioblast, the mesoderm progenitor that gives rise to blood and endothelial cells. However, expression of the transcription factors Runx1 and Scl is greatly reduced, suggesting an impaired ability of the hemangioblast to differentiate. Lastly, we observed that known miR-24 target, Trib3, is upregulated in the miR-24 antagonized embryoid bodies (EBs). Overexpression of Trib3 alone in ESCs was able to decrease HPC production, though not as great as seen with miR-24 knockdown. These results demonstrate an essential role for miR-24 in the hematopoietic differentiation of ESCs. Although many miRNAs have been implicated in regulation of hematopoiesis, this is the first miRNA observed to be required for the specification of mammalian blood progenitors from early mesoderm.","['Roy, Lynn', 'Bikorimana, Emmanuel', 'Lapid, Danica', 'Choi, Hyewon', 'Nguyen, Tan', 'Dahl, Richard']","['Roy L', 'Bikorimana E', 'Lapid D', 'Choi H', 'Nguyen T', 'Dahl R']","['Harper Cancer Research Institute, South Bend, Indiana, United States of America; Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, South Bend, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Harper Cancer Research Institute, South Bend, Indiana, United States of America; Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, South Bend, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Dept. of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Dept. of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Harper Cancer Research Institute, South Bend, Indiana, United States of America; Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, South Bend, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Harper Cancer Research Institute, South Bend, Indiana, United States of America; Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, South Bend, Indiana, United States of America; Dept. of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['P30 DK090948/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5P30DK090948/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150129,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/biosynthesis', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",PMC4310609,,2015/01/31 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2015/01/31 06:00'],"['2014/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1004959 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-14-00909 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2015 Jan 29;11(1):e1004959. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004959. eCollection 2015 Jan.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn24 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TRB3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the relationship between the genetic aberrations and tumor cell drug resistance or disease progression remains unclear. Frameshift deletions were detected by gene sequencing in the NOTCH1 PEST domain in three naive CLL patients. These mutations were associated with chromosomal abnormalities including trisomy 12 or 13q deletion. Of note, one of the patients developed Richter's transformation during FCR treatment. Immunofluorescent and western blot analyses revealed a markedly higher intracellular domain of NOTCH (ICN) expression in the mutated cells compared with their unmutated counterparts and normal CD19+ B lymphocytes (P<0.01 and P<0.001, respectively). In addition, strong DNA-kappaB binding activities were observed in the mutant cells by gel shift assays. RT-PCR analysis revealed elevated RelA mRNA expression in the mutant cells, while RelB levels were variable. Reduced levels of RelA and RelB mRNA were observed in unmutated CLL and normal B cells. Compared to unmutated CLL and normal B cells, increased apoptosis occurred in the mutant cells in the presence of GSI (ICN inhibitor) and PDTC (NF-kappaB inhibitor), particularly under the synergistic effects of the two drugs (P=0.03). Moreover, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, the active components in the NF-kappaB pathway, were markedly inhibited following prolonged treatment with GSI and PDTC. These results suggested that NOTCH1 mutations constitutively activate the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in CLL, which is likely related to ICN overexpression, indicating NOTCH1 and NF-kappaB as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of CLL.","['Xu, Zhen-Shu', 'Zhang, Ju-Shun', 'Zhang, Jing-Yan', 'Wu, Shun-Quan', 'Xiong, Dong-Lian', 'Chen, Hui-Jun', 'Chen, Zhi-Zhe', 'Zhan, Rong']","['Xu ZS', 'Zhang JS', 'Zhang JY', 'Wu SQ', 'Xiong DL', 'Chen HJ', 'Chen ZZ', 'Zhan R']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, P.R.

The obtained data are in agreement with the hypothesis that the toxicity of aminoferrocenes is not dependent upon p53 status. Subsequently the toxicity of a selected prodrug (4) was investigated ex vivo using rat precision cut liver slices and in vivo on hybrid male mice BDF1. In both experiments no toxicity was observed: ex vivo, up to 10 muM; in vivo, up to 6 mg/kg. Finally, prodrug 4 was shown to extend the survival of BDF1 mice carrying L1210 leukemia from 13.7 +/- 0.6 days to 17.5 +/- 0.7 days when injected daily 6 times at a dose of 26 mug/kg starting from the second day after injection of L1210 cells.","['Daum, Steffen', 'Chekhun, Vasiliy F', 'Todor, Igor N', 'Lukianova, Natalia Yu', 'Shvets, Yulia V', 'Sellner, Leopold', 'Putzker, Kerstin', 'Lewis, Joe', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'de Graaf, Inge A M', 'Groothuis, Geny M M', 'Casini, Angela', 'Zozulia, Oleksii', 'Hampel, Frank', 'Mokhir, Andriy']","['Daum S', 'Chekhun VF', 'Todor IN', 'Lukianova NY', 'Shvets YV', 'Sellner L', 'Putzker K', 'Lewis J', 'Zenz T', 'de Graaf IA', 'Groothuis GM', 'Casini A', 'Zozulia O', 'Hampel F', 'Mokhir A']","['Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Organic Chemistry II, Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nurnberg , Henkestrasse 42, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150209,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Carbamates/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ferrous Compounds/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Liver/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Prodrugs/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2015/01/31 06:00,2015/05/08 06:00,['2015/01/31 06:00'],"['2015/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jm5019548 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2015 Feb 26;58(4):2015-24. doi: 10.1021/jm5019548.

Deregulation of epigenetic effectors, including altered expression of histone methyltransferases from the MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) family, have been reported in many cancer types, yet little is known concerning their involvement in larynx cancer. Our objective was to determine the expression profile of MLL genes in larynx carcinoma and normal adjacent tissues and correlate this profile to tumor characteristics. We analyzed the expression profile of 5 MLL genes in 13 cases of larynx carcinoma and their adjacent non-tumor tissues using quantitative real-time PCR. MLL3 was significantly downregulated in tumor samples compared to their normal counterparts, and all MLL genes showed decreased expression in advanced tumors compared to tumors in the initial stage. Altered expression in a single MLL gene was associated with a similar alteration in the other MLL genes, revealing a strong correlation of expression in each individual patient. In conclusion, MLL genes may have similar transcriptional control, and decreased expression of these genes may contribute to larynx cancer progression.","['Figueiredo, David Livingstone Alves', 'do Amaral Rabello, Doralina', 'Zanette, Dalila Luciola', 'Saggioro, Fabiano Pinto', 'Mamede, Rui Celso Martins', 'Zago, Marco Antonio', 'da Silva, Wilson Araujo Jr', 'Saldanha-Araujo, Felipe', 'Pittella Silva, Fabio']","['Figueiredo DL', 'do Amaral Rabello D', 'Zanette DL', 'Saggioro FP', 'Mamede RC', 'Zago MA', 'da Silva WA Jr', 'Saldanha-Araujo F', 'Pittella Silva F']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pathology of Cancer, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Brasilia, Campus Universitario Darcy Ribeiro, Brasilia, DF 70.910-900, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology of Cancer, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Brasilia, Campus Universitario Darcy Ribeiro, Brasilia, DF 70.910-900, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Therapy and Regional Blood Center, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP 14.048-900, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP 14.048-900, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP 14.048-900, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Therapy and Regional Blood Center, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP 14.048-900, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Therapy and Regional Blood Center, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP 14.048-900, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology of Cancer, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Brasilia, Campus Universitario Darcy Ribeiro, Brasilia, DF 70.910-900, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology of Cancer, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Brasilia, Campus Universitario Darcy Ribeiro, Brasilia, DF 70.910-900, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150128,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",,,2015/01/31 06:00,2016/01/05 06:00,['2015/01/31 06:00'],"['2014/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2015.3756 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2015 Apr;33(4):2017-22. doi: 10.3892/or.2015.3756.

So far, these two subtypes are not associated to clear differences in gene expression profiles. Interestingly, recent results have highlighted important roles for heterogeneity, both at the genetic and at the epigenetic level in CLL progression. METHODS: We analyzed gene expression data of two large cohorts of CLL patients and quantified expression variability across individuals to investigate differences between the two subtypes using different measures and statistical tests. Functional significance was explored by pathway enrichment and network analyses. Furthermore, we implemented a random forest approach based on expression variability to classify patients into disease subtypes. RESULTS: We found that U-CLL, the more aggressive type of the disease, shows significantly increased variability of gene expression across patients and that, overall, genes that show higher variability in the aggressive subtype are related to cell cycle, development and inter-cellular communication. These functions indicate a potential relation between gene expression variability and the faster progression of this CLL subtype. Finally, a classifier based on gene expression variability was able to correctly predict the disease subtype of CLL patients. CONCLUSIONS: There are strong relations between gene expression variability and disease subtype linking significantly increased expression variability to phenotypes such as aggressiveness and resistance to therapy in CLL.","['Ecker, Simone', 'Pancaldi, Vera', 'Rico, Daniel', 'Valencia, Alfonso']","['Ecker S', 'Pancaldi V', 'Rico D', 'Valencia A']","['Structural Biology and Biocomputing Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Structural Biology and Biocomputing Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Structural Biology and Biocomputing Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain.', 'Structural Biology and Biocomputing Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO), 28029 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150128,England,Genome Med,Genome medicine,101475844,,,PMC4308895,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/01/30 06:01,['2015/01/30 06:00'],"['2014/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13073-014-0125-z [doi]', '125 [pii]']",epublish,Genome Med. 2015 Jan 28;7(1):8. doi: 10.1186/s13073-014-0125-z. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of HTLV-1 antibodies among blood donors at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, Eastern Nigeria. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on consented participants over 4 months. A total of 300 blood donors were recruited consecutively from the blood bank. The serum of the collected 5 mL of blood obtained from each participant was stored at -20 degrees C until required for analysis. The serum samples were then analyzed for antibodies to HTLV-1 using a one-step incubation double-antigen sandwich ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kit. Participants' demographic characteristics and degree of exposure to the risk factors associated with HTLV-1 infection were captured using a questionnaire. Statistical analysis of results was done using SPSS version 17. RESULTS: Of the 300 blood donors, 288 (96%) were male, while 12 (4%) were female. The average age of the blood donors was 26.85+/-8.52 years. The age group with the highest representation among the blood donors were those aged between 21 and 25 years. Only 22.3% of the blood donors were above 30 years. None of the 300 screened blood donors tested positive to HTLV-1 antibodies. Hence, the seroprevalence of HTLV-1 infection among blood donors was 0%. Of the blood donors, 5% had history of previous sexually transmitted disease, while 34.7% used condoms during sexual intercourse.

These drugs are distinctive in increasing blood lymphocytes while simultaneously shrinking enlarged lymph nodes, suggesting anatomical redistribution of CLL cells from lymph nodes into the blood. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood. In this study, we showed that the egress receptor, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1PR1), was expressed at low levels in normal germinal centers and CLL lymph nodes in vivo but became upregulated on normal B cells and, to a variable and lesser extent, CLL cells following in vitro incubation in S1P-free medium. Spontaneous recovery of S1PR1 expression on normal B and CLL cells was prevented by BCR cross-linking, whereas treatment of CLL cells with idelalisib increased S1PR1 expression and migration toward S1P, the greatest increase occurring in cases with unmutated IgH V region genes. Intriguingly, ibrutinib and fostamatinib had no effect on S1PR1 expression or function. Conversely, chemokine-induced migration, which requires integrin activation and is essential for the entry of lymphocytes into lymph nodes as well as their retention, was blocked by ibrutinib and fostamatinib, but not idelalisib. In summary, our results suggest that different BCR signaling inhibitors redistribute CLL cells from lymph nodes into the blood through distinct mechanisms: idelalisib actively promotes egress by upregulating S1PR1, whereas fostamatinib and ibrutinib may reduce CLL cell entry and retention by suppressing chemokine-induced integrin activation.","['Till, Kathleen J', 'Pettitt, Andrew R', 'Slupsky, Joseph R']","['Till KJ', 'Pettitt AR', 'Slupsky JR']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, United Kingdom k.j.till@liv.ac.uk.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3GA, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150128,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Aminopyridines', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Movement', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*genetics/immunology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Germinal Center/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrins/genetics/immunology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Lysophospholipids/immunology/metabolism', 'Morpholines', 'Oxazines/pharmacology', 'Piperidines', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/immunology', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Lysosphingolipid/*genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/immunology/metabolism', 'Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors', 'Syk Kinase']",PMC4337486,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/04/25 06:00,['2015/01/30 06:00'],"['2015/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1402304 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1402304 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 Mar 1;194(5):2439-46. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1402304.

We therefore tested the effects of increasing the electron flux through the respiratory chain as a strategy to induce oxidative stress and cell death preferentially in AML cells. Treatment with the fatty acid palmitate induced oxidative stress and cell death in AML cells, and it suppressed tumor burden in leukemic cell lines and primary patient sample xenografts in the absence of overt toxicity to normal cells and organs.

However, the results of clinical trials have been overall disappointing. In this review we discuss the mechanism of retinoic acid signaling and the results of major clinical trials that have attempted to incorporate ATRA into AML regimens. We discuss recent evidence that indicate that the retinoic acid signaling pathway may be dysfunctional in AML. Preliminary studies suggest that targeting the pathways that modify retinoic acid receptor activity may reactivate the dormant retinoic acid-signaling pathway. Such strategies may revive the ability of ATRA to induce myeloid differentiation and apoptosis in non-APL AML.","['Johnson, Daniel E', 'Redner, Robert L']","['Johnson DE', 'Redner RL']","['Department of Medicine and University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh PA 15213 USA.', 'Department of Medicine and University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh PA 15213 USA.

To date, the study of nuclear organization has often involved simple quantitative procedures that struggle with both the irregularity of the nuclear boundary and the problem of handling replicate images. Such studies typically focus on inter-object distance, rather than spatial location within the nucleus. The concern of this paper is the spatial preference of nuclear compartments, for which we have developed statistical tools to quantitatively study and explore nuclear organization. These tools combine replicate images to generate 'aggregate maps' which represent the spatial preferences of nuclear compartments. We present two examples of different compartments in mammalian fibroblasts (WI-38 and MRC-5) that demonstrate new knowledge of spatial preference within the cell nucleus. Specifically, the spatial preference of RNA polymerase II is preserved across normal and immortalized cells, whereas PML nuclear bodies exhibit a change in spatial preference from avoiding the centre in normal cells to exhibiting a preference for the centre in immortalized cells.

Our analysis method includes input from both protein-protein interaction and phenotype similarity networks. This introduces valuable information from disease relevant phenotypes, which aids the identification of sub-networks that are significantly enriched in differentially expressed genes and are related to the disease relevant phenotypes. This contrasts with many active sub-network detection methods, which rely solely on protein-protein interaction networks derived from compounded data of many unrelated biological conditions and which are therefore not specific to the context of the experiment. PhenomeExpress thus exploits readily available animal model and human disease phenotype information. It combines this prior evidence of disease phenotypes with the experimentally derived disease data sets to provide a more targeted analysis. Two case studies, in subchondral bone in osteoarthritis and in Pax5 in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, demonstrate that PhenomeExpress identifies core disease pathways in both mouse and human disease expression datasets derived from different technologies. We also validate the approach by comparison to state-of-the-art active sub-network detection methods, which reveals how it may enhance the detection of molecular phenotypes and provide a more detailed context to those previously identified as possible candidates.","['Soul, Jamie', 'Hardingham, Timothy E', 'Boot-Handford, Raymond P', 'Schwartz, Jean-Marc']","['Soul J', 'Hardingham TE', 'Boot-Handford RP', 'Schwartz JM']","['Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['088785/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '20414/ARC_/Arthritis Research UK/United Kingdom', '20414/VAC_/Versus Arthritis/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150129,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Bone and Bones/pathology', '*Databases, Genetic', 'Disease/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Osteoarthritis/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Protein Interaction Maps/genetics', 'Species Specificity']",PMC4822650,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/10/21 06:00,['2015/01/30 06:00'],"['2014/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['srep08117 [pii]', '10.1038/srep08117 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Jan 29;5:8117. doi: 10.1038/srep08117.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important factor in adolescent quality of life is their perception of parental rearing behavior. The aim of this study was to explore how perceived parental rearing behaviors related to the quality of life of adolescents with leukemia. A descriptive, exploratory study was conducted among 106 adolescents with leukemia using the Recalled Parental Rearing Behavior and the Minneapolis-Manchester Quality of Life scales. Data were examined using descriptive, correlation, and path analyses. The coefficients of total effect of paternal and maternal emotional warmth on the quality of life of adolescents were 0.36 and 0.45, respectively. We found that paternal rejection/punishment behavior was significantly correlated with maternal rejection/punishment behavior (P < .00); paternal and maternal control/overprotection behavior were also significantly correlated with each other (P < .00). We found that perceived parental warmth has a moderate effect on the quality of life of adolescents, that quality of life was related to both paternal and maternal rearing behaviors, and that the mother's and father's rearing behaviors were correlated with each other. To improve the quality of life of adolescents with leukemia, the patient's care plan should aim to enhance positive parental rearing behaviors in both parents.","['Kim, Dong Hee', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Lee, Sunhee']","['Kim DH', 'Chung NG', 'Lee S']","['Sungshin University, College of Nursing, Seoul, Korea.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."", 'The Catholic University of Korea, College of Nursing, Seoul, Korea shlee418@catholic.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150128,United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Health Services', 'Child', '*Child Rearing', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*nursing/psychology', 'Male', 'Oncology Nursing', '*Parent-Child Relations', 'Pediatric Nursing', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/01/30 06:00,2016/09/20 06:00,['2015/01/30 06:00'],"['2015/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1043454214563412 [pii]', '10.1177/1043454214563412 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2015 Sep-Oct;32(5):295-303. doi: 10.1177/1043454214563412.

In addition, we aimed to study peritoneal fluid (PF) levels of interleukin (IL)-1alpha and IL-6 in the same subsets of women. METHODS: Eutopic endometrial biopsy and PF samples were taken from patients with rASRM stage I-II endometriosis and healthy controls undergoing laparoscopy. Endometrial LIF, LIFR and gp130 immunostaining and PF levels of IL-1alpha and IL-6 were assessed. Endometrial biopsy samples were obtained again after postoperative goserelin acetate treatment and on-going pregnancies were registered during a 6-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Reduced endometrial staining of LIF, LIFR and gp130, unaffected by surgery and goserelin, was seen in endometriosis patients without a recorded pregnancy during the study. Elevated PF levels of IL-6 and, in particular, IL-1alpha were detected in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced eutopic endometrial LIF, LIFR and gp130 protein expression may be associated with subfertility in women with minimal-mild endometriosis. Combined surgical and goserelin acetate treatment does not seem to restore the expression of these members of the IL-6 cytokine superfamily. Elevated peritoneal fluid levels of IL-1alpha and IL-6 may further contribute to the difficulties of achieving pregnancy in these patients.","['Moberg, Christian', 'Bourlev, Vladimir', 'Ilyasova, Natalia', 'Olovsson, Matts']","['Moberg C', 'Bourlev V', 'Ilyasova N', 'Olovsson M']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, 751 85, Uppsala, Sweden, christian.moberg@kbh.uu.se.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150129,Germany,Arch Gynecol Obstet,Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,8710213,IM,"['Adult', 'Ascitic Fluid/chemistry/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Endometriosis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Endometrium/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/blood/*etiology', 'Interleukin-1alpha/*analysis/blood', 'Interleukin-6/*analysis/blood', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy']",,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/30 06:00'],"['2014/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00404-015-3626-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2015 Aug;292(2):429-37. doi: 10.1007/s00404-015-3626-0.

In lytic infection, an important early event is the colocalization of ICP0 to nuclear domain 10 (ND10), the discrete nuclear bodies that impose restrictions on viral expression. ICP0 contains an E3 ubiquitin ligase that degrades promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and Sp100, two major components of ND10, and disperses ND10 to alleviate repression. We previously reported that the association between ICP0 and ND10 is a dynamic process that includes three steps: adhesion, fusion, and retention. ICP0 residues 245 to 474, defined as ND10 entry signal (ND10-ES), is a region required for the fusion step. Without ND10-ES, ICP0 adheres at the ND10 surface but fails to enter. In the present study, we focus on characterizing ND10-ES. Here we report the following. (i) Fusion of ICP0 with ND10 relies on specific sequences located within ND10-ES. Replacement of ND10-ES by the corresponding region from ORF61 of varicella-zoster virus did not rescue ND10 fusion. (ii) Three tandem ND10 fusion segments (ND10-FS1, ND10-FS2, and ND10-FS3), encompassing 200 amino acids within ND10-ES, redundantly facilitate fusion. Each of the three segments is sufficient to independently drive the fusion process, but none of the segments by themselves are necessary for ND10 fusion. Only when all three segments are deleted is fusion blocked. (iii) The SUMO interaction motif located within ND10-FS2 is not required for ND10 fusion but is required for the complete degradation of PML, suggesting that PML degradation and ND10 fusion are regulated by different molecular mechanisms. IMPORTANCE: ND10 nuclear bodies are part of the cell-intrinsic antiviral defenses that restrict viral gene expression upon virus infection. As a countermeasure, infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) localizes to ND10s, degrades the ND10 organizer, and disperses ND10 components in order to alleviate repression. We studied the ICP0-ND10 association to delineate elements important for this dynamic interaction and to understand its role in viral replication and host defense. In this work, we show that ICP0 contains three redundant segments to ensure an effective mergence of ICP0 with ND10 nuclear bodies. This is the first study to systematically investigate ICP0 elements that are important for ICP0-ND10 fusion.","['Zheng, Yi', 'Gu, Haidong']","['Zheng Y', 'Gu H']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA haidong.gu@wayne.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150128,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/genetics/*physiology', 'Herpes Simplex/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC4442361,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/05/29 06:00,['2015/01/30 06:00'],"['2015/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/29 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.03658-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.03658-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2015 Apr;89(8):4214-26. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03658-14.

In a previous study using microarray analysis, we found that the expression of ANGPT-1 was upregulated in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell lines compared with that in uninfected Burkitt and other leukemia cell lines. Other authors have also reported focal expression of ANGPT-1 mRNA in biopsy specimens of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) tissue from patients with AIDS. Here, to confirm these findings, we examined the expression and secretion levels of ANGPT-1 in KSHV-infected PEL cell lines and address the mechanisms of ANGPT-1 transcriptional regulation. We also showed that ANGPT-1 was expressed and localized in the cytoplasm and secreted into the supernatant of KSHV-infected PEL cells. Deletion studies of the regulatory region revealed that the region encompassing nucleotides -143 to -125 of the ANGPT-1-regulating sequence was responsible for this upregulation. Moreover, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by quantitative PCR, suggested that some KSHV-infected PEL cell line-specific DNA-binding factors, such as OCT-1, should be involved in the upregulation of ANGPT-1 in a sequence-dependent manner. IMPORTANCE: We confirmed that ANGPT-1 was expressed in and secreted from KSHV-infected PEL cells and that the transcriptional activity of ANGPT-1 was upregulated. A 19-bp fragment was identified as the region responsible for ANGPT-1 upregulation through binding with OCT-1 as a core factor in PEL cells. This study suggests that ANGPT-1 is overproduced in KSHV-infected PEL cells, which could affect the pathophysiology of AIDS patients with PEL.","['Zheng, Xin', 'Ohsaki, Eriko', 'Ueda, Keiji']","['Zheng X', 'Ohsaki E', 'Ueda K']","['Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Osaka, Japan kueda@virus.med.osaka-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150128,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Angiopoietin-1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Up-Regulation']",PMC4403476,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/06/11 06:00,['2015/01/30 06:00'],"['2014/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.03144-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.03144-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2015 May;89(9):4786-97. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03144-14.

These observations ultimately led to the clinical development and utility of IFN-alpha2b for the treatment of patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and chronic myelogenous leukemia, among others. However, the mechanism of action of type I IFNs in vivo was never fully elucidated, and the pleiotropic effects of IFNs on multiple cell types had made it challenging to decipher. Advancement of genetically engineered mouse models has provided new tools for interrogating these mechanisms. Recent evidence has indicated that spontaneous innate immune sensing of cancers that leads to adaptive immune responses is dependent on host type I IFN production and signaling. The major innate immune receptor pathway that leads to type I IFN production in response to a growing tumor appears to be the STING pathway of cytosolic DNA sensing. STING agonists drive type I IFN production and are impressively therapeutic in mouse tumor models. Targeting low doses of type I IFNs to the tumor microenvironment also promotes anti-tumor activity via host adaptive immunity that is T cell-dependent. However, high doses of intratumoral type I IFNs largely function via an anti-angiogenic effect. Understanding these mechanistic details should enable improved clinical manipulation of the type I IFN system in cancer.","['Gajewski, Thomas F', 'Corrales, Leticia']","['Gajewski TF', 'Corrales L']","['Department of Pathology and Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, The University of Chicago, 5841 S.

This enzyme selectively hydrolyzes the extracellular amino acid L-asparagine into L-aspartate and ammonia, leading to nutritional deficiencies, protein synthesis inhibition, and ultimately death of lymphoblastic cells by apoptosis. Currently, bacterial asparaginases are used for treatment purpose but offers scepticism due to a number of toxicities, including thrombosis, pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, and hepatotoxicity. Resistance towards bacterial asparaginase is another major disadvantage during cancer management. This situation attracted attention of researchers towards alternative sources of L-asparaginase, including plants and fungi. Present article discusses about potential of L-asparaginase as an anticancer agent, its mechanism of action, and adverse effects related to current asparaginase formulations. This article also provides an outlook for recent developments in L-asparaginase discovery from alternative sources and their potential as a less toxic alternative to current formulations.","['Shrivastava, Abhinav', 'Khan, Abdul Arif', 'Khurshid, Mohsin', 'Kalam, Mohd Abul', 'Jain, Sudhir K', 'Singhal, Pradeep K']","['Shrivastava A', 'Khan AA', 'Khurshid M', 'Kalam MA', 'Jain SK', 'Singhal PK']","['College of Life Sciences, Cancer Hospital & Research Institute, Gwalior, MP 474009, India.', 'College of Life Sciences, Cancer Hospital & Research Institute, Gwalior, MP 474009, India; Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, PO Box 2457, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.

Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), chemokine ligand-2 (CCL2) and soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) play crucial roles in tumor cell adhesion, motivation and survival, but their roles in leukemia CNS metastasis remain to be elucidated. We investigated the prognostic significance of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) MMP-9, CCL2 and sVCAM-1 in leukemia patients to explore their potential as predictive biomarkers of the development of CNS leukemia (CNSL). MMP-9, CCL2 and sVCAM-1 were measured in paired CSF and serum samples collecting from 33 leukemia patients with or without CNS metastasis. Other risk factors related to CNSL prognosis were also analyzed. sVCAM-1Serum and CCL2Serum/CSF were significantly higher in the CNSL group than in the non-CNSL group and the controls (p < 0.05). MMP-9Serum was insignificantly lower in the CNSL group than in the non-CNSL group and the controls (p > 0.05). No differences were found for the sVCAM-1Serum, CCL2Serum, and MMP-9Serum levels between non-CNSL patients and controls (p > 0.05). MMP-9CSF was significantly higher in the CNSL group than both the non-CNSL and the control groups (p < 0.05). The indexes of sVCAM-1, CCL2, and MMP-9 in the CNSL group were lower than in the controls (p < 0.05). Positive correlations were determined between the MMP-9CSF and the ALBCSF/BBB value/WBCCSF, between sVCAM-1Serum and the WBCCSF/BBB value. Negative correlations existed between MMP-9Serum and the ALBCSF/BBB value/WBCCSF, and between the CCL2 index and ALBCSF. sVCAM-1Serum was positively associated with event-free survival (EFS), and patients with higher levels of ALBCSF, MMP-9CSF/Serum, CCL2CSF/Serum, and sVCAM-1CSF/Serum had shorter EFS. MMP-9CSF, CCL2CSF and sVCAM-1CSF are the first three principal components analyzed by cluster and principal component analysis. Our data suggest that MMP-9, CCL2 and sVCAM-1 in the CSF may be more potent than serum in predicting the possibility of leukemia metastatic CNS and the outcome of CNSL patients.","['Si, Meng-Ya', 'Fan, Zhi-Cheng', 'Li, Ya-Zhen', 'Chang, Xiao-Lan', 'Xie, Qing-Dong', 'Jiao, Xiao-Yang']","['Si MY', 'Fan ZC', 'Li YZ', 'Chang XL', 'Xie QD', 'Jiao XY']","['Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Shantou University Medical College, 22 Xinling Road, Shantou, 515041, Guangdong, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150130,United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*blood/*cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis/secondary', 'Chemokine CCL2/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/30 06:00'],"['2014/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11060-014-1707-8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2015 Apr;122(2):229-44. doi: 10.1007/s11060-014-1707-8.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records of patients with AML treated at our institution were reviewed to identify those with SS. Patient characteristics, laboratory values, and cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: We identified 21 of 2178 (1%) AML patients who demonstrated clinical signs and symptoms, and histological features consistent with SS. Eleven patients (52%) were classified as AML with myelodysplasia-related features and 3 patients had therapy-related AML. Three patients had received treatment with granulocyte colony stimulation factor, 1 patient liposomal all-trans-retinoic acid, and 2 patients received hypomethylating agents before development of SS. Cytogenetic analysis revealed diploid karyotype in 7 patients (33%); -5/del(5q) in 8 patients (38%): 3 patients had -5/del(5q) as the sole abnormality and 5 patients had -5/del(5q) as part of complex cytogenetics; and complex cytogenetics in 5 patients (24%).

The mortality rate is high, as the fungus is resistant to most antifungal agents. Here, we present the case of a 66-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia who developed infective endocarditis caused by S. prolificans infection during induction chemotherapy. Her 1,3-beta-D-glucan levels were elevated and computed tomography revealed bilateral sinusitis and disseminated small nodular masses within the lungs and spleen; it nonetheless took 6 days to identify S. prolificans by blood culture. The patient died of multi-organ failure despite the combined use of voriconazole and terbinafine. Autopsy revealed numerous mycotic emboli within multiple organs (caused by mitral valve vegetation) and endocarditis (caused by S. prolificans). The geographic distribution of this infection is limited to Australia, the United States, and southern Europe, particularly Spain. The first Japanese case was reported in 2011, and four cases have been reported to date, including this one. Recently, the incidence of S. prolificans-disseminated infection in immunocompromised patients has increased in Japan. Therefore, clinicians should consider S. prolificans infection as a differential diagnosis when immunocompromised patients suffer disseminated infections with elevated 1,3-beta-D-glucan levels.","['Ochi, Yotaro', 'Hiramoto, Nobuhiro', 'Takegawa, Hiroshi', 'Yonetani, Noboru', 'Doi, Asako', 'Ichikawa, Chihiro', 'Imai, Yukihiro', 'Ishikawa, Takayuki']","['Ochi Y', 'Hiramoto N', 'Takegawa H', 'Yonetani N', 'Doi A', 'Ichikawa C', 'Imai Y', 'Ishikawa T']","['Department of Hematology, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, 2-2, Minatojima-Minamimachi, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20150129,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Endocarditis/blood/*complications/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*complications/drug therapy', 'Multiple Organ Failure/blood/complications/microbiology', 'Mycoses/blood/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Naphthalenes/therapeutic use', 'Proteoglycans', 'Scedosporium/*isolation & purification', 'Terbinafine', 'Voriconazole/therapeutic use', 'beta-Glucans/blood']",,,2015/01/30 06:00,2016/02/13 06:00,['2015/01/30 06:00'],"['2014/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-015-1752-x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Jun;101(6):620-5. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1752-x.

In recent years, the use of next-generation sequencing techniques has uncovered new and, in some cases, unexpected driver genes with prognostic and therapeutic value. The mutational landscape of CLL is characterized by high-genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity, low mutation recurrence and a long tail of cases with undefined driver genes. On the other hand, the use of deep sequencing has also revealed high intra-tumor heterogeneity and provided a detailed picture of clonal evolution processes. This phenomenon, in which aberrant DNA methylation can also participate, appears to be tightly associated to poor outcomes and chemo-refractoriness, thus providing a new subject for therapeutic intervention. Hence, and having in mind the limitations derived from the CLL complexity thus described, the application of massively parallel sequencing studies has unveiled a wealth of information that is expected to substantially improve patient staging schemes and CLL clinical management.","['Rodriguez, David', 'Bretones, Gabriel', 'Arango, Javier R', 'Valdespino, Victor', 'Campo, Elias', 'Quesada, Victor', 'Lopez-Otin, Carlos']","['Rodriguez D', 'Bretones G', 'Arango JR', 'Valdespino V', 'Campo E', 'Quesada V', 'Lopez-Otin C']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Instituto Universitario de Oncologia-IUOPA, Universidad de Oviedo, 33006, Oviedo, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150129,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clonal Evolution', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mutation']",,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2015/01/30 06:00'],"['2014/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-015-1733-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Mar;101(3):219-28. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1733-0.

Several hypotheses for pathogenesis have been described. Management has been controversial; some authors described resolution following priapism-specific interventions, and others recommended addition of CML-specific therapy or even CML-specific therapy alone. AIM: In this report, we describe presentation and management of a man with refractory priapism that was the first presenting manifestation of CML. We also report, for the first time, the pathology sections of the sinusoidal tissue in such cases. Literature is reviewed for similar cases and their outcome. METHODS: A 21-year-old male patient presented with painful priapism that started 6 days earlier and failed aspiration-irrigation. CBC revealed marked leucocytosis. Oncology care diagnosed CML, and treatment with Imatinib was commenced with prior semen cryopreservation. Following remission, a penile prosthesis was implanted, assisted by optical corporotomy. Sinusoidal tissue biopsy was stained by hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) and CD34. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pathology sections of cavernous tissue following CML-induced priapism. RESULTS: The penile implant survived without complications. H&E examination of the sinusoidal tissue biopsy revealed leukemic infiltration associated with vascular endothelial damage. CD34 staining showed the mixed picture of leukemic infiltrates, intact vascular endothelium with lumena showing leukemic cells, alternating with destroyed vessels, and no vascular lumena and ruminants of endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: Priapism can be the first manifestation of previously undetected CML. The pathological picture of sinusoidal tissue in such cases is presented. In the case at hand, a complete blood picture was helpful in early diagnosis of CML and early initiation of targeted chemotherapy along with the corporal irrigation/aspiration or shunt surgery. It is therefore recommended to have a CBC examined at presentation of any case of ischemic priapism of unknown etiology, early initiation of CML therapy along with aspiration/irrigation, preferably cryopreserving a semen sample before CML therapy.","['Shaeer, Osama Kamal Zaki Mahmoud', 'Shaeer, Kamal Zaki Mahmoud', 'AbdelRahman, Islam Fathy Soliman', 'El-Haddad, Mostafa Shawky', 'Selim, Osama Mohamed']","['Shaeer OK', 'Shaeer KZ', 'AbdelRahman IF', 'El-Haddad MS', 'Selim OM']","['Department of Andrology, Kasr El Aini Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20150129,Netherlands,J Sex Med,The journal of sexual medicine,101230693,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Cryopreservation', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', '*Penile Prosthesis', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Priapism/drug therapy/*etiology/pathology', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Semen Preservation', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2015/01/30 06:00'],"['2015/01/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1111/jsm.12812 [doi]', 'S1743-6095(15)30962-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Sex Med. 2015 Mar;12(3):827-34. doi: 10.1111/jsm.12812.

The present study aimed to determine the underlying mechanisms of matrine in inhibiting the chronic myeloid leukemia cells (CML). It was observed that matrine treatment significantly suppressed CML cells proliferation, induced apoptosis and resulted in the accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase, accompanied by a significant decrease in Bcl-xL, Cyclin D1, and c-Myc expression. Western blot analyses revealed that matrine treatment resulted in the down-regulation in phospho-STAT3 and phospho-JAK2 without significantly effects on STAT3 and JAK2 protein levels. Matrine significantly reduced the expression of IL-6, a potent upstream activating factor of STAT3.

Bisulfite genomic sequencing analysis showed that the RPRM promoter was methylated in the majority of AML samples (66.2-83.1%), whereas RPRM was almost unmethylated in normal bone marrow samples (20.0-27.7%). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed poor survival outcomes in samples with RPRM promoter methylation (p < 0.001). Proliferation of AML cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05) after RPRM overexpression with lentivirus transfection. Apoptosis was up-regulated in RPRM-overexpressing AML cells.

Here, we intended to study the role played by TKI, imatinib, in selection of gene mutations and development of chromosomal abnormalities in Indian CML patients. METHODS: Direct sequencing methodology was employed to detect mutations and conventional cytogenetics was done to identify Philadelphia duplication. RESULTS: Among the different mechanisms of imatinib resistance, kinase domain mutations (39%) of the BCR/ABL gene were seen to be more prevalent, followed by mutations in the SH3-SH2 domain (4%) and then BCR/ABL amplification with the least frequency (1%). The median duration of occurrence of mutation was significantly shorter for patients with front line imatinib than those pre-treated with hydroxyurea. Patients with high Sokal score (p = 0.003) showed significantly higher incidence of mutations, as compared to patients with low/intermediate score. Impact of mutations on the clinical outcome in AP and BC was observed to be insignificant. Of the 94 imatinib resistant patients, only 1 patient exhibited duplication of Philadelphia chromosome, suggesting a less frequent occurrence of this abnormality in Indian CML patients. CONCLUSION: Close monitoring at regular intervals and proper analysis of the disease resistance would facilitate early detection of resistance and thus aid in the selection of the most appropriate therapy.","['Vaidya, Shantashri', 'Vundinti, Babu Rao', 'Shanmukhaiah, Chandrakala', 'Chakrabarti, Prantar', 'Ghosh, Kanjaksha']","['Vaidya S', 'Vundinti BR', 'Shanmukhaiah C', 'Chakrabarti P', 'Ghosh K']","['Department of Cytogenetics, National Institute of Immunohaematology, 13th Floor, New Multistoried Building, KEM Hospital Campus, Parel, Mumbai, 400012, India.', 'Department of Cytogenetics, National Institute of Immunohaematology, 13th Floor, New Multistoried Building, KEM Hospital Campus, Parel, Mumbai, 400012, India.', 'Department of Haematology, 10th Floor, New Multistoried Building, KEM Hospital, Parel, Mumbai, 400012, India.', 'Institute of Haematology and Transfusion Medicine, Kolkata, West Bengal, 700073, India.', 'Department of Cytogenetics, National Institute of Immunohaematology, 13th Floor, New Multistoried Building, KEM Hospital Campus, Parel, Mumbai, 400012, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150128,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Duplication', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Mutation/*drug effects', 'Mutation Rate', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Selection, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'src Homology Domains']",PMC4309587,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0114828 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-26243 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Jan 28;10(1):e0114828. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0114828. eCollection 2015.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, limited data are available to assess the trends in research output related to orphan diseases. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used bibliometric mapping and clustering methods to illustrate the level of fragmentation in myeloma research and the development of collaborative efforts. Publication data from Thomson Reuters Web of Science were retrieved for 2005-2009 and followed until 2013. We created a database of multiple myeloma publications, and we analysed impact and co-authorship density to identify scientific collaborations, developments, and international key players over time. The global annual publication volume for studies on multiple myeloma increased from 1,144 in 2005 to 1,628 in 2009, which represents a 43% increase. This increase is high compared to the 24% and 14% increases observed for lymphoma and leukaemia. The major proportion (>90% of publications) was from the US and EU over the study period. The output and impact in terms of citations, identified several successful groups with a large number of intra-cluster collaborations in the US and EU.

However, although GPCRs are common targets for other diseases, there are few GPCR-based pharmaceuticals for inflammation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether targeting G-protein betagamma (Gbetagamma) complexes could provide a useful new approach for modulating interleukin 2 (IL-2) levels in CD4+ T helper cells. Gallein, a small molecule inhibitor of Gbetagamma, increased levels of T cell receptor (TCR)-stimulated IL-2 mRNA in primary human naive and memory CD4+ T helper cells and in Jurkat human CD4+ leukemia T cells. Gbeta1 and Gbeta2 mRNA accounted for >99% of Gbeta mRNA, and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of Gbeta1 but not Gbeta2 enhanced TCR-stimulated IL-2 mRNA increases. Blocking Gbetagamma enhanced TCR-stimulated increases in IL-2 transcription without affecting IL-2 mRNA stability. Blocking Gbetagamma also enhanced TCR-stimulated increases in nuclear localization of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFAT1), NFAT transcriptional activity, and levels of intracellular Ca2+. Potentiation of IL-2 transcription required continuous Gbetagamma inhibition during at least two days of TCR stimulation, suggesting that induction or repression of additional signaling proteins during T cell activation and differentiation might be involved. The potentiation of TCR-stimulated IL-2 transcription that results from blocking Gbetagamma in CD4+ T helper cells could have applications for autoimmune diseases.","['Yost, Evan A', 'Hynes, Thomas R', 'Hartle, Cassandra M', 'Ott, Braden J', 'Berlot, Catherine H']","['Yost EA', 'Hynes TR', 'Hartle CM', 'Ott BJ', 'Berlot CH']","['Weis Center for Research, Geisinger Clinic, Danville, Pennsylvania, 17822-2623, United States of America.', 'Weis Center for Research, Geisinger Clinic, Danville, Pennsylvania, 17822-2623, United States of America.', 'Weis Center for Research, Geisinger Clinic, Danville, Pennsylvania, 17822-2623, United States of America.', 'Weis Center for Research, Geisinger Clinic, Danville, Pennsylvania, 17822-2623, United States of America.', 'Weis Center for Research, Geisinger Clinic, Danville, Pennsylvania, 17822-2623, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM050369/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 GM050369/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM050369/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150128,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'GTP-Binding Protein beta Subunits/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Protein gamma Subunits/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Xanthenes/pharmacology']",PMC4309538,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0116575 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-46576 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Jan 28;10(1):e0116575. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0116575. eCollection 2015.,"['0 (G-protein Beta gamma)', '0 (GTP-Binding Protein beta Subunits)', '0 (GTP-Binding Protein gamma Subunits)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '8L0084U2QR (gallein)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in CML, basophils are often immature and thus escape microscopic quantification. We have previously shown that tryptase is produced and secreted by immature CML basophils. In the current study, serum samples of 79 CML patients (chronic phase=CP, n=69; accelerated/blast phase=AP/BP, n=10) treated with BCR/ABL inhibitors, were analyzed for their tryptase content. Serum-tryptase levels at diagnosis were found to correlate with basophil counts and were higher in AP/BP patients (median tryptase: 29.9 ng/mL) compared to patients with CP (11.7 ng/mL; p<0.05). In 20/69 patients with CP, progression occurred. The progression-rate was higher in patients with tryptase >15 ng/mL (31%) compared to those with normal tryptase levels (9%, p<0.05). To validate tryptase as new prognostic variable, we replaced basophils by tryptase levels in the EUTOS score. This modified EUTOS-T score was found to predict progression-free and event-free survival significantly better, with p values of 0.000064 and 0.00369, respectively, compared to the original EUTOS score (progression-free survival: p=0.019; event-free survival: p=0.156). In conclusion, our data show that the serum-tryptase level at diagnosis is a powerful prognostic biomarker in CML.

Macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) is crucially involved in the development of osteolytic bone lesions in MM. We previously reported that minodronate inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced MIP-1alpha secretion in mouse myeloma cells. However, it remains unknown whether bisphosphonates and statins inhibit MIP-1alpha secretion by human MM cells. In present study, we investigated whether bisphosphonates and statins had any inhibitory effect on MIP-1alpha secretion by human myeloma cells and the mechanism underlying this effect. In this study, we found that bisphosphonates and statins inhibited MIP-1alpha mRNA and MIP-1alpha secretion and suppressed extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt phosphorylation by inhibiting Ras prenylation. Moreover, bisphosphonates and statins suppressed the expression of acute myeloid leukemia-1A (AML-1A) mRNA, a MIP-1alpha transcription factor. These results indicate that bisphosphonates and statins suppress the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/ERK/AML-1A and Ras/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt/AML-1A pathways, thereby inhibiting MIP-1alpha secretion by MM cells. Therefore, use of MIP-1alpha expression inhibitors such as bisphosphonates and statins may provide a new therapeutic approach to inhibiting tumour progression and bone destruction in MM patients.","['Tsubaki, Masanobu', 'Takeda, Tomoya', 'Sakamoto, Kotaro', 'Shimaoka, Hirotaka', 'Fujita, Arisa', 'Itoh, Tatsuki', 'Imano, Motohiro', 'Mashimo, Kenji', 'Fujiwara, Daiichiro', 'Sakaguchi, Katsuhiko', 'Satou, Takao', 'Nishida, Shozo']","['Tsubaki M', 'Takeda T', 'Sakamoto K', 'Shimaoka H', 'Fujita A', 'Itoh T', 'Imano M', 'Mashimo K', 'Fujiwara D', 'Sakaguchi K', 'Satou T', 'Nishida S']","['Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kinki University School of Pharmacy Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kinki University School of Pharmacy Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kinki University School of Pharmacy Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kinki University School of Pharmacy Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kinki University School of Pharmacy Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Food Science and Nutrition, Kinki University School of Agriculture Nara, Nara, Japan.', 'Department of Surgery, Kinki University School of Medicine Osakasayama, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kinki University School of Pharmacy Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Japan ; Department of Pharmacy, Japanese Red Cross Society Wakayama Medical Center Wakayama, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kinki University School of Pharmacy Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Japan ; Department of Pharmacy, Japanese Red Cross Society Wakayama Medical Center Wakayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Japanese Red Cross Society Wakayama Medical Center Wakayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kinki University School of Medicine Osakasayama, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy, Kinki University School of Pharmacy Kowakae, Higashi-Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141215,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,,PMC4300689,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/01/30 06:01,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2014 Dec 15;5(1):168-79. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML-1A', 'Akt', 'Bisphosphonate', 'ERK', 'MIP-1alpha', 'Ras', 'myeloma', 'statin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This reflects a poor prognosis of this malignancy in most parts of the world, where contemporary and rather complex remedies are not available. There are a few well documented reports about the epidemiologic features of AL at national level in Iran. This retrospective study demonstrates demographic and laboratory features of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) patients admitted to the main referral oncology hospitals in the ex-Iran University of Medical Sciences in Tehran (Firoozgar and Rasoul-Akram hospitals) during the last decade (2001-2011). METHODS: Medical records of all patients admitted to the both hospitals diagnosed with AML and ALL were reviewed during the study period for demographic, biological and clinical characteristics at diagnosis. RESULTS: Four-hundred fifty five patients were diagnosed with AML and ALL, who admitted to the both hospitals during ten years, of whom 59.6 % (271 patients) were male. Fifty five percent of patients had AML and 44.6 % had ALL, both significantly dominated in men (p<0.001). AML patients died more significantly (p<0.05) and the most deaths occurred in older patients (p<0.001). Initial WBC count was significantly related to death (p= 0.001), where the least death (13%) occurred in the group with initial WBC between 5-10x10(3)/muL and most of deceased had an initial WBC more than 10x10(3)/muL. Logistic regression showed that age, fever and WBC were significant prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: Demographic characteristics of AL patients were almost the same as other global reports. Most deaths occurred in older patients, those who had fever, and patients with higher WBC count at first admission, which warrants more investigations accurately and also improvements in hospital records.","['Ayremlou, Parvin', 'Razavi, Seyed Mohsen', 'Solaymani-Dodaran, Masoud', 'Vakili, Masoud', 'Asadi-Lari, Mohsen']","['Ayremlou P', 'Razavi SM', 'Solaymani-Dodaran M', 'Vakili M', 'Asadi-Lari M']","['Dept. of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Oncopathology Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Oncopathology Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran ; Oncopathology Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],,Iran,Iran J Cancer Prev,Iranian journal of cancer prevention,101500574,,,PMC4294538,,2012/07/01 00:00,2012/07/01 00:01,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2012/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2012/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Cancer Prev. 2012 Summer;5(3):157-63.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Epidemiology', 'Iran']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the response rate and prognostic factor of adult patients suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who were treated with chemotherapy in south east of Iran and demographic methods were used for this study. METHODS: This study was conducted in Ali Ebne Abitaleb Hospital in south east of Iran (Zahedan) from 2003-2010. All adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in hematology ward received Vincristin, Daunorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, Prednisolone and high dose Methotrexate for induction therapy. All patients' information was recorded and multivariate analysis and survival studies were performed by using Kaplan-Meier statistics. RESULTS: Sixty six adult patients entered. Mean age of them was 33 years old (16-68), that 53 (80.3%) cases were male and 13 cases were female. Fifty one (77.3%) cases experienced complete remission and 15 (22.7%) cases had no remission state. In the following year 53% ( 33) was alive with complete remission and 47% ( 31) were dead. Median survival was 13 months. In the end of study 30 cases were in complete remission and alive and 36 (54.5%) were dead.

Morning salivary cortisol was measured and Behavior Scales of Sensitivity to Pain for Children (BSSPC) and Pre-Linguistic Behavioral Pain Reactivity Scale (PL-BPRS) were applied. RESULTS: The results showed a high significant correlation between cortisol levels and pain sensitivity. Cortisol suppression was observed in some participants. The roles of gender and age in relation between cortisol levels and sensitivity to pain were assessed by using moderated regression. Gender and age moderated the relation between sensitivity to pain and cortisol level. CONCLUSION: Conditional fear can explain for high sensitivity to pain amongst the participants; chemotherapy drugs might play a role in cortisol suppression and parenthood style perhaps determines sex difference in reaction to pain.","['Firoozi, Manijeh', 'Rostami, Reza']","['Firoozi M', 'Rostami R']","['Dept. of Psychology, Tehran University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Dept. of Psychology, Tehran University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Cancer Prev,Iranian journal of cancer prevention,101500574,,,PMC4299622,,2012/04/01 00:00,2012/04/01 00:01,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2011/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2012/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Cancer Prev. 2012 Spring;5(2):74-80.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Child', 'Cortisol', 'Leukemia', 'Pain']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation results in the production of the AML1/ETO (A/E) fusion protein and commonly involves cooperating activating mutations of RAS. AE9a encodes a C-terminally truncated A/E protein of 575 amino acids that retains the ability to recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs). Expression of AE9a leads to rapid development of leukemia in experimental mouse systems. We have recently shown that treatment of mice bearing A/E9a;Nras (G12D) tumors with the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) panobinostat leads to degradation of the A/E9a fusion protein, cell cycle arrest, differentiation of AML blasts into mature granulocytes and prolonged survival. Herein, we sought to enhance this therapeutic effect. FINDINGS: Combined treatment of mice bearing A/E9a;Nras (G12D) leukemias with panobinostat and arsenic trioxide (ATO) resulted in a significant survival advantage compared to mice treated with either agent alone. Moreover, some of the mice treated with the panobinostat/ATO combination showed complete tumor responses and remained in remission for over 220 days. Panobinostat caused differentiation of A/E9a;Nras (G12D) cells while ATO induced apoptosis of the leukemic cells, an effect that was enhanced following co-treatment with panobinostat. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that leukemic blast differentiation mediated by panobinostat combined with induction of apoptosis by ATO could be therapeutically beneficial and should be considered for patients with t(8;21) AML.","['Salmon, Jessica M', 'Bots, Michael', 'Vidacs, Eva', 'Stanley, Kym L', 'Atadja, Peter', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Johnstone, Ricky W']","['Salmon JM', 'Bots M', 'Vidacs E', 'Stanley KL', 'Atadja P', 'Zuber J', 'Johnstone RW']","['Cancer Therapeutics Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St. Andrews Place, East Melbourne, 3002 VIC Australia ; The Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, 3010 VIC Australia.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Chemistry, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St. Andrews Place, East Melbourne, 3002 VIC Australia.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St. Andrews Place, East Melbourne, 3002 VIC Australia.', 'China Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, No. 2 BoYun Road, Pudong, Shanghai 201203 China.', 'Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP), Dr. Bohr-Gasse 7, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.', 'Cancer Therapeutics Program, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St. Andrews Place, East Melbourne, 3002 VIC Australia ; The Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, 3010 VIC Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150122,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,,,PMC4308003,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/01/30 06:01,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-014-0034-4 [doi]', '34 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2015 Jan 22;7:2. doi: 10.1186/s13148-014-0034-4. eCollection 2015.,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic trioxide', 'Differentiation', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitor', 'Therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,['Clin Epigenetics. 2020 Nov 18;12(1):178.

Since response to HHT varies among patients, our study aimed to identify biomarkers that might influence the response to HHT using a panel of various human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Genome-wide association (GWA) analysis using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and mRNA expression data was assessed for association with cytotoxicity to HHT in LCLs. Integrated analysis among SNPs, expression, AUC value was also performed to help select candidate genes for further functional characterization. Functional validation of candidate genes was performed using leukemia cell lines (U937, K562). Candidate genes were knocked down using specific siRNA and its response to HHT was assessed using MTS assay. We found that 15 expression probes were associated with HHT AUC with P < 10(-4), and 96 individual probe sets with P < 10(-3). Eighteen SNPs were associated with HHT AUC with P < 10(-5) and 281 SNPs with P < 10(-4). The integrated analysis identified 4 unique SNPs that were associated with both expression and AUC. Functional validation using siRNA knockdown in leukemia cell lines showed that knocking down CCDC88A, CTBP2, SOCS4 genes in U937 and K562 cells significantly altered HHT cytotoxicity. In summary, this study performed with LCLs can help to identify novel biomarker that might contribute to variation in response to HHT therapy.","['Tong, Yin', 'Niu, Nifang', 'Jenkins, Gregory', 'Batzler, Anthony', 'Li, Liang', 'Kalari, Krishna R', 'Wang, Liewei']","['Tong Y', 'Niu N', 'Jenkins G', 'Batzler A', 'Li L', 'Kalari KR', 'Wang L']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated First People's Hospital Shanghai, China."", 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Statistic and Bioinformatics, Department of Health Science Research, Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Statistic and Bioinformatics, Department of Health Science Research, Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Beijing, China.', 'Division of Statistic and Bioinformatics, Department of Health Science Research, Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['U19 GM061388/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20150113,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,PMC4292778,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/01/30 06:01,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2014.00465 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2015 Jan 13;5:465. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2014.00465. eCollection 2014.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Homoharringtonine (HHT)', 'biomarkers', 'genome-wide association study', 'leukemia', 'lymphoblastoid cell line system']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elucidation the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance to chemoresistance may lead to better clinical outcomes. RESULTS: In order to identify potential protein targets involved in the drug-resistant phenotype of leukemia, especially the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), we used a high-resolution ""ultra-zoom"" 2DE-based proteomics approach to characterize global protein expression patterns in doxorubicin-resistant myelogenous leukemia cells compared with parental control cells. Ultra-high resolution of 2DE was achieved by using a series of slightly overlapping narrow-range IPG strips during isoelectric focusing (IEF) separation. A total number of 44 proteins with altered abundances were detected and identified by MALDI-TOF or LC-MS/MS. Among these proteins, enolase, aldolase, HSP70 and sorcin were up-regulated in doxorubicin-resistant myelogenous leukemia cell line, whereas HSP27 was down-regulated. Some of the results have been validated by Western blotting. Both enolase and aldolase were first reported to be involved in chemoresistance, suggesting that process of glycolysis in doxorubicin-resistant myelogenous leukemia cells was accelerated to some extent to provide more energy to survive chemical stress. Possible roles of most of the identified proteins in development of chemoresistance in myelogenous leukemia cells were fully discussed. The results presented here could provide clues to further study for elucidating the mechanisms underlying drug resistance in leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: As a whole, under the chemical stress, the doxorubicin-resistant myelogenous leukemia cells may employ various protective strategies to survive. These include: (i) pumping the cytotoxic drug out of the cells by P-glycoprotein, (ii) increased storage of fermentable fuel, (iii) sophisticated cellular protection by molecular chaperones, (iv) improved handling of intracellular calcium, (v) increased glucose utilization via increased rates of glycolysis. In the present study, proteomic analysis of leukemia cells and their drug resistant variants revealed multiple alterations in protein expression. Our results indicate that the development of drug resistance in doxorubicin-resistant myelogenous leukemia cells is a complex phenomenon undergoing several mechanisms.","['Qinghong, Shi', 'Shen, Gao', 'Lina, Song', 'Yueming, Zhao', 'Xiaoou, Li', 'Jianlin, Wu', 'Chengyan, He', 'Hongjun, Li', 'Haifeng, Zhao']","['Qinghong S', 'Shen G', 'Lina S', 'Yueming Z', 'Xiaoou L', 'Jianlin W', 'Chengyan H', 'Hongjun L', 'Haifeng Z']","['Jilin University China-Japan Union Hospital, Changchun, 130033 China.', 'Jilin University China-Japan Union Hospital, Changchun, 130033 China.', 'Jilin University China-Japan Union Hospital, Changchun, 130033 China.', 'Jilin University China-Japan Union Hospital, Changchun, 130033 China ; Tumor Hospital of Jilin Province, Changchun, 130021 China.', 'Tumor Hospital of Jilin Province, Changchun, 130021 China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Quality Research in Chinese Medicines, Macau University of Science and Technology, Avenida Wai Long, Taipa, Macau, China.', 'Jilin University China-Japan Union Hospital, Changchun, 130033 China.', 'Jilin University China-Japan Union Hospital, Changchun, 130033 China.', 'Jiamusi University, Jiamusi, 154002 China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150122,England,Proteome Sci,Proteome science,101170539,,,PMC4307195,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/01/30 06:01,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12953-014-0057-y [doi]', '57 [pii]']",epublish,Proteome Sci. 2015 Jan 22;13(1):1. doi: 10.1186/s12953-014-0057-y. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Estimation of the mean residual life is complicated by the upper tail of the survival distribution not being observed as, for example, patients may still be alive at the end of the follow-up period. Various approaches have been developed to estimate the mean residual life in the presence of such right censoring. In this work, a novel semi-parametric method that combines existing non-parametric methods and an extreme value tail model is presented, where the limited sample information in the tail (prior to study termination) is used to estimate the upper tail behaviour.

For each case, increased interlobar bridging was observed in nuclei of the myeloid cells, many of which were bilobed and morphologically similar to Pelger Huet (PH) cells. The high-dose group (n = 5, 2.98-4.61 Gy-Eq) exhibited 13.0 +/- 0.85% PH cells (mean +/- SEM) in the neutrophil population compared to 6.8 +/- 1.6% in the low-dose group (n = 3, 0.29-0.86 Gy-Eq; p = 0.008). An age- and gender-matched control group (n = 8) exhibited 3.6 +/- 0.9% PH cells. Results of a one-way ANOVA show that the high-dose group is statistically different from both the low-dose group and the control group (p = 0.002). However, the low-dose group is not statistically different from the control group (p = 0.122). The mean number of nuclear lobes in blood neutrophils was also enumerated as a function of time after exposure and was found to be diminished, consistent with incomplete nuclear segmentation that is characteristic of the Pelger Huet anomaly (PHA). In contrast to these changes in myeloid cells, the morphology of erythrocytes and platelets appeared to be normal. The authors conclude that ionizing radiation induces abnormal morphology of circulating neutrophils, which is similar to the pseudo-PHA that is acquired in disorders such as myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, and leukemoid reactions. Potential molecular mechanisms by which radiation induces this morphological change are discussed. From this cohort, the biomarker appears to be present early post-accident (<9 h) and stable at least up to 16 y post-accident. Assessment of circulating pseudo-Pelger Huet cells is being investigated as a potential biodosimetric tool.","['Goans, Ronald E', 'Iddins, Carol J', 'Christensen, Doran', 'Wiley, Albert', 'Dainiak, Nicholas']","['Goans RE', 'Iddins CJ', 'Christensen D', 'Wiley A', 'Dainiak N']","['*MJW Corporation, Amherst, NY; daggerRadiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training Site, Oak Ridge, TN; double daggerYale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Nucleus/radiation effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/pathology/radiation effects', 'Pelger-Huet Anomaly/*blood/*etiology/pathology', '*Radioactive Hazard Release']",,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/04/09 06:00,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/HP.0000000000000183 [doi]', '00004032-201503000-00001 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2015 Mar;108(3):303-7. doi: 10.1097/HP.0000000000000183.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Core PCP proteins such as Van Gogh-like2 (VANGL2) are evolutionarily highly conserved; however, the mammalian PCP machinery is still poorly understood mainly due to lack of suitable models and quantitative methodology. WNT/PCP has been implicated in many human diseases with the most distinguished positive role in the metastatic process, which accounts for more than 90% of cancer related deaths, and presents therefore an attractive target for pharmacological interventions. However, cellular assays for the assessment of PCP signaling, which would allow a more detailed mechanistic analysis of PCP function and possibly also high throughput screening for chemical compounds targeting mammalian PCP signaling, are still missing. RESULTS: Here we describe a mammalian cell culture model, which correlates B lymphocyte migration of patient-derived MEC1 cells and asymmetric localization of fluorescently-tagged VANGL2. We show by live cell imaging that PCP proteins are polarized in MEC1 cells and that VANGL2 polarization is controlled by the same mechanism as in tissues i.e. it is dependent on casein kinase 1 activity. In addition, destruction of the actin cytoskeleton leads to migratory arrest and cell rounding while VANGL2-EGFP remains polarized suggesting that active PCP signaling visualized by polarized distribution of VANGL2 is a cause for and not a consequence of the asymmetric shape of a migrating cell. CONCLUSIONS: The presented imaging-based methodology allows overcoming limitations of earlier approaches to study the mammalian WNT/PCP pathway, which required in vivo models and analysis of complex tissues. Our system investigating PCP-like signaling on a single-cell level thus opens new possibilities for screening of compounds, which control asymmetric distribution of proteins in the PCP pathway.","['Kaucka, Marketa', 'Petersen, Julian', 'Janovska, Pavlina', 'Radaszkiewicz, Tomasz', 'Smyckova, Lucie', 'Daulat, Avais M', 'Borg, Jean-Paul', 'Schulte, Gunnar', 'Bryja, Vitezslav']","['Kaucka M', 'Petersen J', 'Janovska P', 'Radaszkiewicz T', 'Smyckova L', 'Daulat AM', 'Borg JP', 'Schulte G', 'Bryja V']","['Institute of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic. gunnar.schulte@ki.se.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150128,England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Polarity/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics/*immunology']",PMC4314808,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['s12964-014-0079-1 [pii]', '10.1186/s12964-014-0079-1 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2015 Jan 28;13:2. doi: 10.1186/s12964-014-0079-1.,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (VANGL2 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified an outbreak of central line-associated bloodstream infection due to RGM at a hematology-oncology ward during a 5-month period. DESIGN Outbreak investigation and literature review. SETTING A Japanese tertiary care center. PATIENTS Adults who were hospitalized at the hematology-oncology ward from October 15, 2011, through February 17, 2012. RESULTS A total of 5 patients with a bloodstream infection due to RGM (4 cases of Mycobacterium mucogenicum and 1 case of Mycobacterium canariasense infection) were identified; of these, 3 patients had acute myeloid leukemia, 1 had acute lymphocytic leukemia, and 1 had aplastic anemia. Four of the 5 patients received cord blood transplantation prior to developing the bloodstream infection. All central venous catheters in patients with a bloodstream infection were removed. These patients promptly defervesced after catheter removal and their care was successfully managed without antimicrobial therapy. Surveillance cultures from the environment and water detected M. mucogenicum and M. canariasense in the water supply of the hematology-oncology ward. The isolates from the bloodstream infection and water sources were identical on the basis of 16S-rRNA gene sequencing. CONCLUSIONS The source of RGM in the outbreak of bloodstream infections likely was the ward tap water supply. Awareness of catheter-related bloodstream infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria should be emphasized, especially where immunocompromised patients are at risk. Also, using antimicrobials after catheter removal to treat central line-associated bloodstream infection due to RGM may not be necessary.

DESIGN Retrospective clinical study with VRE molecular strain typing. SETTING A regional referral center for acute leukemia. PATIENTS Two hundred fourteen consecutive patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia between 2006 and 2012. METHODS All patients had a culture of first stool and weekly surveillance for VRE. Clinical data were abstracted from the Intermountain Healthcare electronic data warehouse. VRE molecular typing was performed utilizing the semi-automated DiversiLab System. RESULTS The rate of VRE colonization was directly proportional to length of stay and was higher in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Risk factors associated with colonization include administration of corticosteroids (P=0.004) and carbapenems (P=0.009). Neither a colonized prior room occupant nor an increased unit colonization pressure affected colonization risk. Colonized patients with acute myelogenous leukemia had an increased risk of VRE bloodstream infection (BSI, P=0.002). Other risk factors for VRE BSI include severe neutropenia (P=0.04) and diarrhea (P=0.008). Fifty-eight percent of BSI isolates were identical or related by molecular typing. Eighty-nine percent of bloodstream isolates were identical or related to stool isolates identified by surveillance cultures. VRE BSI was associated with increased costs (P=0.0003) and possibly mortality. CONCLUSIONS VRE colonization has important consequences for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia undergoing induction therapy. For febrile neutropenic patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, use of empirical antibiotic regimens that avoid carbapenems and include VRE coverage may be helpful in decreasing the risks associated with VRE BSI.","['Ford, Clyde D', 'Lopansri, Bert K', 'Haydoura, Souha', 'Snow, Greg', 'Dascomb, Kristin K', 'Asch, Julie', 'Bo Petersen, Finn', 'Burke, John P']","['Ford CD', 'Lopansri BK', 'Haydoura S', 'Snow G', 'Dascomb KK', 'Asch J', 'Bo Petersen F', 'Burke JP']","['1Acute Leukemia Program,LDS Hospital,Salt Lake City,Utah.', '2Division of Infectious Diseases,LDS Hospital and the University of Utah,Salt Lake City,Utah.', '2Division of Infectious Diseases,LDS Hospital and the University of Utah,Salt Lake City,Utah.', '3Statistical Data Center,LDS Hospital,Salt Lake City,Utah.', '2Division of Infectious Diseases,LDS Hospital and the University of Utah,Salt Lake City,Utah.', '1Acute Leukemia Program,LDS Hospital,Salt Lake City,Utah.', '1Acute Leukemia Program,LDS Hospital,Salt Lake City,Utah.', '2Division of Infectious Diseases,LDS Hospital and the University of Utah,Salt Lake City,Utah.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Infection control and hospital epidemiology,8804099,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bacteremia/economics/epidemiology', 'Carbapenems/therapeutic use', 'Carrier State/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Diarrhea/epidemiology', 'Febrile Neutropenia/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/economics/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Typing', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci/classification', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/10/28 06:00,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0899823X14000038 [pii]', '10.1017/ice.2014.3 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2015 Jan;36(1):47-53. doi: 10.1017/ice.2014.3.,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Carbapenems)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not known if the augmented contractile gene expression characterizing the myofibroblast phenotype impacts its intrinsic ability to assemble fibronectin (FN) and extracellular matrix. In this study we investigated whether myofibroblasts displayed increased rates of FN fibril assembly when compared with their undifferentiated counterparts. Freshly plated myofibroblasts assemble exogenous FN (488-FN) into a fibrillar matrix more rapidly than fibroblasts that have not undergone myofibroblast differentiation. The augmented rate of FN matrix formation by myofibroblasts was dependent on intact Rho/Rho kinase (ROCK) and myosin signals inasmuch as treatment with Y27632 or blebbistatin attenuated 488-FN assembly. Inhibiting contractile gene expression by pharmacologic disruption of the transcription factors megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1)/serum response factor (SRF) during myofibroblast differentiation resulted in decreased contractile force generation and attenuated 488-FN incorporation although not FN expression. Furthermore, disruption of the MKL1/SRF target gene, smooth muscle alpha-actin (alpha-SMA) via siRNA knockdown resulted in attenuation of 488-FN assembly. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a linkage between increased contractile gene expression, most importantly alpha-SMA, and the intrinsic capacity of myofibroblasts to assemble exogenous FN into fibrillar extracellular matrix.","['Torr, Elizabeth E', 'Ngam, Caitlyn R', 'Bernau, Ksenija', 'Tomasini-Johansson, Bianca', 'Acton, Benjamin', 'Sandbo, Nathan']","['Torr EE', 'Ngam CR', 'Bernau K', 'Tomasini-Johansson B', 'Acton B', 'Sandbo N']","['From the Departments of Medicine and.', 'From the Departments of Medicine and.', 'From the Departments of Medicine and.', 'Surgery, University of Wisconsin-Madison, School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin 53792.', 'From the Departments of Medicine and.', 'From the Departments of Medicine and nsandbo@medicine.wisc.edu.']",['eng'],"['K08 HL093367/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5K08HL093367/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150127,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myofibroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/metabolism', 'Serum Response Factor/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",PMC4358119,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/05/30 06:00,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)76773-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.606186 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Mar 13;290(11):6951-61. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.606186.

We previously showed that Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 cooperatively protect platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells from apoptosis. Despite BH3-mimetics represent promising drugs to target Bcl-xL, anti-Mcl-1 strategies are still in pre-clinical studies and required new investigations. Calcium is a universal second messenger and dysregulation of calcium signal is often observed during carcinogenesis. As change in cytosolic free calcium concentration [Ca(2+)]i is known to control the fate of the cell by regulating Bcl-2 family members, we wonder if calcium signal could impact on Mcl-1 expression and if its pharmacological inhibition could be useful to sensitize ovarian carcinoma cells to anti-Bcl-xL strategies. We therefore studied the effect of different calcium signals inhibitors in ovarian carcinoma cell lines SKOV3 and IGROV1-R10 and analysed their effects on proliferation and Mcl-1 expression. We also exposed these cells to these inhibitors in combination with anti-Bcl-xL strategies (siRNA or BH3-mimetic: ABT-737). We found that calcium signaling regulates Mcl-1 through translational events and a calmodulin-mediated pathway. BAPTA-AM and calmodulin inhibitor combination with ABT-737 leads to apoptosis, a process that is reversed by Mcl-1 enforced expression. As Mcl-1 represents a crucial hurdle to the success of chemotherapy, these results could open to new area of investigation using calcium modulators to directly or indirectly target Mcl-1 and thus efficiently sensitize ovarian carcinoma cells to anti-Bcl-xL strategies.","['Bonnefond, Marie-Laure', 'Lambert, Bernard', 'Giffard, Florence', 'Abeilard, Edwige', 'Brotin, Emilie', 'Louis, Marie-Helene', 'Gueye, Mor Seny', 'Gauduchon, Pascal', 'Poulain, Laurent', ""N'Diaye, Monique""]","['Bonnefond ML', 'Lambert B', 'Giffard F', 'Abeilard E', 'Brotin E', 'Louis MH', 'Gueye MS', 'Gauduchon P', 'Poulain L', ""N'Diaye M""]","['Normandy University, Caen, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Carcinoma/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4348506,,2015/01/30 06:00,2016/01/05 06:00,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-015-1095-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2015 Apr;20(4):535-50. doi: 10.1007/s10495-015-1095-3.,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is related to self-renewal capacity and circulating tumor cell (CTC) characteristics for tumor metastasis. Although tumor metastasis is a life-threatening, complicated process that occurs through circulation of tumor cells, mechanistic aspects of self-renewal and circulating capacities have been largely unknown. Hepatic transmembrane 4 L six family member 5 (TM4SF5) promotes EMT for malignant growth and migration, so it was rationalized that TM4SF5, as a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biomarker, might be important for metastatic potential. Here, self-renewal capacity by TM4SF5 was mechanistically explored using hepatocarcinoma cells with or without TM4SF5 expression, and we explored whether they became CTCs using mouse liver-orthotopic model systems. We found that TM4SF5-dependent sphere growth correlated with CD24(-) , aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, as well as a physical association between CD44 and TM4SF5. Interaction between TM4SF5 and CD44 was through their extracellular domains with N-glycosylation modifications. TM4SF5/CD44 interaction activated proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (c-Src)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/Twist-related protein 1 (Twist1)/B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi1) signaling for spheroid formation, whereas disturbing the interaction, expression, or activity of any component in this signaling pathway inhibited spheroid formation. In serial xenografts using 200 approximately 5,000 cells per injection, TM4SF5-positive tumors exhibited subpopulations with locally increased CD44 expressions, supporting for tumor cell differentiation. TM4SF5-positive, but not TM4SF5- or CD44-knocked-down, cells were identified circulating in blood 4-6 weeks after orthotopic liver injection using in vivo laser scanning endomicroscopy. Anti-TM4SF5 reagent blocked their metastasis to distal intestinal organs. CONCLUSION: TM4SF5 promotes self-renewal and CTC properties supported by TM4SF5(+) /CD44(+(TM4SF5-bound)) /ALDH(+) /CD24(-) markers during HCC metastasis.","['Lee, Doohyung', 'Na, Juri', 'Ryu, Jihye', 'Kim, Hye-Jin', 'Nam, Seo Hee', 'Kang, Minkyung', 'Jung, Jae Woo', 'Lee, Mi-Sook', 'Song, Haeng Eun', 'Choi, Jungeun', 'Lee, Gyu-Ho', 'Kim, Tai Young', 'Chung, June-Key', 'Park, Ki Hun', 'Kim, Sung-Hak', 'Kim, Hyunggee', 'Seo, Howon', 'Kim, Pilhan', 'Youn, Hyewon', 'Lee, Jung Weon']","['Lee D', 'Na J', 'Ryu J', 'Kim HJ', 'Nam SH', 'Kang M', 'Jung JW', 'Lee MS', 'Song HE', 'Choi J', 'Lee GH', 'Kim TY', 'Chung JK', 'Park KH', 'Kim SH', 'Kim H', 'Seo H', 'Kim P', 'Youn H', 'Lee JW']","['Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Cancer Research Institute, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Interdisciplinary Program in Genetic Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Interdisciplinary Program in Genetic Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Interdisciplinary Program in Genetic Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Cancer Research Institute, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Imaging Center, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Applied Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Korea.', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, Korea.', 'School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Graduate School of Nanoscience and Technology, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Graduate School of Nanoscience and Technology, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Cancer Research Institute, College of Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Imaging Center, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Interdisciplinary Program in Genetic Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150318,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,IM,"['Animals', 'CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spheroids, Cellular', 'Twist-Related Protein 1/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hep.27721 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2015 Jun;61(6):1978-97. doi: 10.1002/hep.27721.

We describe the years of potential life lost (YPLL) and years of life lived with disease (YLLD) in children and adolescents who died of cancer in the United States to estimate the impact of childhood cancer in the United States in 2009. We examined mortality data in 2009 among children and adolescents <20 years old in both the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) datasets. YPLL and YLLD were calculated for all deaths due to cancer. Histology-specific YPLL and YLLD of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, leukemia, and lymphoma were estimated using SEER. There were 2233 deaths and 153,390.4 YPLL due to neoplasm in 2009. CNS tumors were the largest cause of YPLL (31%) among deaths due to cancer and were the cause of 1.4% of YPLL due to all causes. For specific histologies, the greatest mean YPLL per death was due to atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (78.0 years lost). The histology with the highest mean YLLD per death in children and adolescents who died of cancer was primitive neuroectodermal tumor (4.6 years lived). CNS tumors are the most common solid malignancy in individuals <20 years old and have the highest YPLL cost of all cancers. This offers the first histology-specific description of YPLL in children and adolescents and proposes a new measure of cancer impact, YLLD, in individuals who die of their disease. YPLL and YLLD complement traditional indicators of mortality and help place CNS tumors in the context of other childhood malignancies.","['de Blank, Peter M', 'Ostrom, Quinn T', 'Rouse, Chaturia', 'Wolinsky, Yingli', 'Kruchko, Carol', 'Salcido, Joanne', 'Barnholtz-Sloan, Jill S']","['de Blank PM', 'Ostrom QT', 'Rouse C', 'Wolinsky Y', 'Kruchko C', 'Salcido J', 'Barnholtz-Sloan JS']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, 11100 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, Ohio; Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, 11100 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, Ohio.""]",['eng'],"['K12 CA076917/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12CA076917/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150127,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Life Expectancy', 'Male', 'Mortality, Premature', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4402075,,2015/01/30 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cam4.410 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2015 Apr;4(4):608-19. doi: 10.1002/cam4.410.

Although different native or pegylated ASNase-based chemotherapy are efficient, disease relapse is frequently observed, especially in adult patients. The neo-synthesis of Asn by asparagine synthetase (AsnS) following ASNase treatment, which involves the amino acid response and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, is believed to be the basis of ASNase-resistance mechanisms. However, AsnS expression has not emerged as an accurate predictive factor for ASNase susceptibility. The aim of this study was to identify possible ASNase sensitivity/resistance-related genes or pathways using a new asparaginase, namely a pegylated r-crisantaspase, with a focus on classic Asn-compensatory responses and cell death under conditions of Asn/L-glutamine limitation. We show that, for B-ALL cell lines, changes in the expression of apoptosis-regulatory genes (especially NFkappaB-related genes) are associated with ASNase susceptibility. The response of malignant NK cell lines to ASNase may depend on Asn-compensatory mechanisms and other cellular processes such as cleavage of BCL2A1, a prosurvival member of the Bcl-2 protein family. These results suggest that according to cellular context, factors other than AsnS can influence ASNase susceptibility.","['Chien, Wei-Wen', 'Le Beux, Celine', 'Rachinel, Nicolas', 'Julien, Michel', 'Lacroix, Claire-Emmanuelle', 'Allas, Soraya', 'Sahakian, Pierre', 'Cornut-Thibaut, Aurelie', 'Lionnard, Loic', 'Kucharczak, Jerome', 'Aouacheria, Abdel', 'Abribat, Thierry', 'Salles, Gilles']","['Chien WW', 'Le Beux C', 'Rachinel N', 'Julien M', 'Lacroix CE', 'Allas S', 'Sahakian P', 'Cornut-Thibaut A', 'Lionnard L', 'Kucharczak J', 'Aouacheria A', 'Abribat T', 'Salles G']","['Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UMR 5239 CNRS ENS HCL, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, 165 Chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69921, BP12, Oullins, FRANCE.', 'Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UMR 5239 CNRS ENS HCL, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, 165 Chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69921, BP12, Oullins, FRANCE.', 'Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UMR 5239 CNRS ENS HCL, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, 165 Chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69921, BP12, Oullins, FRANCE.', 'Alizee Pharma, 15 Chemin du Saquin, Espace Europeen, Building G, 69130, Ecully, FRANCE.', 'Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UMR 5239 CNRS ENS HCL, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, 165 Chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69921, BP12, Oullins, FRANCE.', 'Alizee Pharma, 15 Chemin du Saquin, Espace Europeen, Building G, 69130, Ecully, FRANCE.', 'Alizee Pharma, 15 Chemin du Saquin, Espace Europeen, Building G, 69130, Ecully, FRANCE.', 'Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UMR 5239 CNRS ENS HCL, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, 165 Chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69921, BP12, Oullins, FRANCE.', 'Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UMR 5239 CNRS ENS HCL, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, 165 Chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69921, BP12, Oullins, FRANCE.', 'Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UMR 5239 CNRS ENS HCL, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, 165 Chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69921, BP12, Oullins, FRANCE.', 'Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UMR 5239 CNRS ENS HCL, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, 165 Chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69921, BP12, Oullins, FRANCE.', 'Alizee Pharma, 15 Chemin du Saquin, Espace Europeen, Building G, 69130, Ecully, FRANCE.', ""1] Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, UMR 5239 CNRS ENS HCL, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, 165 Chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69921, BP12, Oullins, FRANCE [2] Hospices Civils de Lyon, Service d'Hematologie, 165 Chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69495 Pierre-Benite, FRANCE.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150128,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Asparaginase/*toxicity', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'eIF-2 Kinase/metabolism']",PMC5389037,,2015/01/30 06:00,2016/02/20 06:00,['2015/01/29 06:00'],"['2014/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['srep08068 [pii]', '10.1038/srep08068 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Jan 28;5:8068. doi: 10.1038/srep08068.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its association with other childhood cancers is less clear, with studies hampered by low case numbers. METHODS: We used two large independent datasets to explore risk associations between birthweight and all subtypes of childhood cancer. Data for 16 554 cases and 53 716 controls were obtained by linkage of birth to cancer registration records across five US states, and 23 772 cases and 33 206 controls were obtained from the UK National Registry of Childhood Tumours. US, but not UK, data were adjusted for gestational age, birth order, plurality, and maternal age and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Risk associations were found between birthweight and several childhood cancers, with strikingly similar results between datasets. Total cancer risk increased linearly with each 0.5 kg increase in birthweight in both the US [odds ratio 1.06 (95% confidence interval 1.04, 1.08)] and UK [1.06 (1.05, 1.08)] datasets. Risk was strongest for leukaemia [USA: 1.10 (1.06, 1.13), UK: 1.07 (1.04, 1.10)], tumours of the central nervous system [USA: 1.05 (1.01, 1.08), UK: 1.07 (1.04, 1.10)], renal tumours [USA: 1.17 (1.10, 1.24), UK: 1.12 (1.06, 1.19)] and soft tissue sarcomas [USA: 1.12 (1.05, 1.20), UK: 1.07 (1.00, 1.13)]. In contrast, increasing birthweight decreased the risk of hepatic tumours [USA: 0.77 (0.69, 0.85), UK: 0.79 (0.71, 0.89) per 0.5 kg increase]. Associations were also observed between high birthweight and risk of neuroblastoma, lymphomas, germ cell tumours and malignant melanomas. For some cancer subtypes, risk associations with birthweight were non-linear. We observed no association between birthweight and risk of retinoblastoma or bone tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of all childhood cancers exhibit associations with birthweight. The apparent independence from other factors indicates the importance of intrauterine growth regulation in the aetiology of these diseases.","[""O'Neill, Kate A"", 'Murphy, Michael Fg', 'Bunch,

However, allogeneic transplantation is associated with significant morbidity and mortality related to graft versus host disease. Cancer immunotherapy has the capacity to direct a specific cytotoxic immune response against cancer cells, particularly residual cancer cells, in order to reduce the likelihood of disease relapse in a more targeted and tolerated manner. Ex vivo dendritic cells can be primed in various ways to present tumor associated antigen to the immune system, in the context of co-stimulatory molecules, eliciting a tumor specific cytotoxic response in patients. Several approaches to prime dendritic cells and overcome the immunosuppressive microenvironment have been evaluated in pre-clinical and early clinical trials with promising results. In this review, we summarize the clinical data evaluating dendritic cell based vaccines for the treatment of hematological malignancies.","['Pyzer, Athalia R', 'Avigan, David E', 'Rosenblatt, Jacalyn']","['Pyzer AR', 'Avigan DE', 'Rosenblatt J']","['a Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; Harvard Medical School ; Boston , MA USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,101572652,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/*transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vaccination']",PMC4514037,,2015/01/28 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2015/01/28 06:00'],"['2015/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4161/21645515.2014.982993 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2014;10(11):3125-31. doi: 10.4161/21645515.2014.982993.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML, Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'ASCT, Autologous Stem Cell Transplant', 'Apo-DC, Apoptotic body loaded- dendritic cells', 'CML, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'CR, Complete response', 'CTLA-4, Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4', 'DC/AML, Dendritic cell Acute Myeloid Leukemia fusion vaccine', 'DC/MM, Dendritic cell Multiple Myeloma fusion vaccine', 'DNA Deoxyribonucleic acid', 'FLT-ITD, Fms-like Tyrosine Kinase with Internal Tandem Duplication', 'GMCSF, Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor', 'GVHD, Graft vs Host Disease', 'HLA-A*2402, Human Leukocyte antigen A*2402', 'IFN, Interferon', 'IFNg, Interferon gamma', 'IL, Interleukin', 'Id, Idiotype', 'KLH, Keyhole limpet hemocyanin', 'MDS, Myelodysplastic syndrome', 'MHC, Major histocompatibility complex', 'OS, Overall Survival', 'PD-1, Programmed death 1', 'PD-L1, Programmed death-ligand 1', 'PR, Partial response', 'PRR, Pathogen recognition receptor', 'RNA, Ribonucleic acid', 'SCT, Stem cell transplant', 'TGFB, Transforming growth factor beta', 'TNFalpha, Tumor necrosis factor alpha', 'VEGF, Vascular endothelial growth factor', 'VGPR, Very good partial response', ""WT-1, Wilm's tumor suppressor gene 1"", 'cancer', 'dendritic cell', 'immunotherapy', 'leukemia', 'mRNA, mRNA', 'myeloma', 'pDCs, Plasmacytoid Dendritic cell', 'trial', 'vaccine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been implicated in tumor suppression as well as survival of various cancers. The aggressive malignancy of T lymphocytes known as adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. In this study, we show that HTLV-1-infected T cells are characterized by phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of PKC-delta. Expression of HTLV-1 regulatory protein Tax increased PKC-delta phosphorylation. Blockade of PKC-delta by rottlerin suppressed PKC-delta phosphorylation and inhibited cell viability in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells. Rottlerin induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and caspase-mediated apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected T cells. Rottlerin downregulated the expression of proteins involved in G1/S cell cycle transition, cyclin D2, CDK4 and 6, and c-Myc, resulting in dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Furthermore, rottlerin reduced the expression of important anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., survivin, XIAP, Bcl-xL and c-FLIP) and Bcl-2 phosphorylation, and activated the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Our results showed that permanent activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) by HTLV-1 Tax allows infected cells to escape cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and that PKC-delta mediates Tax-induced activation of NF-kappaB. Based on these findings, new therapies designed to target PKC-delta could be potentially useful in the treatment of ATL.","['Mori, Naoki', 'Ishikawa, Chie', 'Senba, Masachika']","['Mori N', 'Ishikawa C', 'Senba M']","['Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030215, Japan.', 'Transdisciplinary Research Organization for Subtropics and Island Studies, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 8528523, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150126,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzopyrans/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism/*virology', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,2015/01/28 06:00,2016/03/22 06:00,['2015/01/28 06:00'],"['2014/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2015.2848 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2015 Apr;46(4):1609-18. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2015.2848.

In the present study, the effects of alphatomatine on human myeloid leukemia HL60 cells were investigated. Treatment of HL60 cells with alphatomatine resulted in growth inhibition and apoptosis in a concentrationdependent manner. Tomatidine, the aglycone of tomatine had little effect on the growth and apoptosis of HL60 cells. Growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by alphatomatine in HL60 cells was partially abrogated by addition of cholesterol indicating that interactions between alphatomatine and cell membraneassociated cholesterol may be important in mediating the effect of alphatomatine. Activation of nuclear factorkappaB by the phorbol ester, 12Otetradecanoylphorbol13acetate failed to prevent apoptosis in HL60 cells treated with alphatomatine. In animal experiments, it was found that treatment of mice with alphatomatine inhibited the growth of HL60 xenografts in vivo.

However, this method can grow increasingly complex with the number of proteins that need to be screened simultaneously: spectral emission overlap of fluorophores and the subsequent need for compensation, lengthy sample preparation, and multiple control tests that need to be performed separately must all be considered. These factors lead to increased costs, and consequently, flow cytometry is performed in core facilities with a dedicated technician operating the instrument. Here, we describe a low-cost, label-free microfluidic method that can determine the phenotypic profiles of single cells. Our method employs Node-Pore Sensing to measure the transit times of cells as they interact with a series of different antibodies, each corresponding to a specific cell-surface antigen, that have been functionalized in a single microfluidic channel. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method not only by screening two acute promyelocytic leukemia human cells lines (NB4 and AP-1060) for myeloid antigens, CD13, CD14, CD15, and CD33, simultaneously, but also by distinguishing a mixture of cells of similar size-AP-1060 and NALM-1-based on surface markers CD13 and HLA-DR. Furthermore, we show that our method can screen complex subpopulations in clinical samples: we successfully identified the blast population in primary human bone marrow samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and screened these cells for CD13, CD34, and HLA-DR. We show that our label-free method is an affordable, highly sensitive, and user-friendly technology that has the potential to transform cellular screening at the benchside.","['Balakrishnan, Karthik R', 'Whang, Jeremy C', 'Hwang, Richard', 'Hack, James H', 'Godley, Lucy A', 'Sohn, Lydia L']","['Balakrishnan KR', 'Whang JC', 'Hwang R', 'Hack JH', 'Godley LA', 'Sohn LL']","['Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California , Berkeley, California 94720, United States.']",['eng'],"['R21 CA156139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R21CA156139-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20150212,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Microfluidics/*methods', 'Porosity', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4350414,,2015/01/28 06:00,2015/09/30 06:00,['2015/01/28 06:00'],"['2015/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ac504613b [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2015 Mar 3;87(5):2988-95. doi: 10.1021/ac504613b.

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify comprehensively the genetic basis of MP intolerance in children with ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The discovery GWAS and replication cohorts included 657 and 371 children from two prospective clinical trials. MP dose intensity was a marker for drug tolerance and toxicities and was defined as prescribed dose divided by the planned protocol dose during maintenance therapy; its association with genotype was evaluated using a linear mixed-effects model. RESULTS: MP dose intensity varied by race and ethnicity and was negatively correlated with East Asian genetic ancestry (P < .001). The GWAS revealed two genome-wide significant loci associated with dose intensity: rs1142345 in TPMT (Tyr240Cys, present in *3A and *3C variants; P = 8.6 x 10(-9)) and rs116855232 in NUDT15 (P = 8.8 x 10(-9)), with independent replication. Patients with TT genotype at rs116855232 were exquisitely sensitive to MP, with an average dose intensity of 8.3%, compared with those with TC and CC genotypes, who tolerated 63% and 83.5% of the planned dose, respectively. The NUDT15 variant was most common in East Asians and Hispanics, rare in Europeans, and not observed in Africans, contributing to ancestry-related differences in MP tolerance. Of children homozygous for either TPMT or NUDT15 variants or heterozygous for both, 100% required >/= 50% MP dose reduction, compared with only 7.7% of others. CONCLUSION: We describe a germline variant in NUDT15 strongly associated with MP intolerance in childhood ALL, which may have implications for treatment individualization in this disease.","['Yang, Jun J', 'Landier, Wendy', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Liu, Chengcheng', 'Hageman, Lindsey', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Chen, Yanjun', 'Crews, Kristine R', 'Kornegay, Nancy', 'Wong, F Lennie', 'Evans, William E', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Yang JJ', 'Landier W', 'Yang W', 'Liu C', 'Hageman L', 'Cheng C', 'Pei D', 'Chen Y', 'Crews KR', 'Kornegay N', 'Wong FL', 'Evans WE', 'Pui CH', 'Bhatia S', 'Relling MV']","[""Jun J.

This open-label dose escalation study assessed the safety and pharmacokinetics of intravenous isavuconazole prophylaxis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia who had undergone chemotherapy and had preexisting/expected neutropenia. Twenty-four patients were enrolled, and 20 patients completed the study. The patients in the low-dose cohort (n = 11) received isavuconazole loading doses on day 1 (400/200/200 mg, 6 h apart) and day 2 (200/200 mg, 12 h apart), followed by once-daily maintenance dosing (200 mg) on days 3 to 28. The loading and maintenance doses were doubled in the high-dose cohort (n = 12). The mean +/- standard deviation plasma isavuconazole areas under the concentration-time curves for the dosing period on day 7 were 60.1 +/- 22.3 mug . h/ml and 113.1 +/- 19.6 mug . h/ml for the patients in the low-dose and high-dose cohorts, respectively. The adverse events in five patients in the low-dose cohort and in eight patients in the high-dose cohort were considered to be drug related. Most were mild to moderate in severity, and the most common adverse events were headache and rash (n = 3 each). One patient in the high-dose cohort experienced a serious adverse event (unrelated to isavuconazole treatment), and two patients each in the low-dose and high-dose cohorts discontinued the study due to adverse events. Of the 20 patients who completed the study, 18 were classified as a treatment success. In summary, the results of this analysis support the safety and tolerability of isavuconazole administered at 200 mg and 400 mg once-daily as prophylaxis in immunosuppressed patients at high risk of fungal infections.

The cure rate is 80% with intensive chemotherapy, which improves survival but also often increases the frequency of adverse side effects, including those of a neurological nature. AIMS: To describe the frequency and characteristics of the neurological complications (NC) in patients with acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), as well as to identify factors associated to their presence, neurological morbidity and survival rate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of the NC present in patients with ALL and AML between 1997 and 2012 treated and followed up by the child onco-haematology unit. The following variables were analysed: demographic data, oncological diagnosis, treatment and NC. RESULTS: Altogether 157 patients were included, 145 without infiltration of the central nervous system at diagnosis and eight with infiltration (rate of NC of 14% and 12%, respectively). The most frequent NC were: neuropathies (31%), altered levels of consciousness (27%), convulsions (22%) and headache (12%). Forty per cent of the patients with NC presented sequelae but none of them died as a consequence of the NC. More NC were detected in the age group of children aged under 6 years with high-degree ALL, at higher levels of severity and in patients who had received a haematopoietic stem-cell transplant, all of them with statistically significant differences.

TLRs are mainly expressed in human immune-related cells, such as monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, B cells and NK cells. The expression or up-regulation of TLRs has been demonstrated in some tumors and tumor cell lines but the role of TLRs in pathogenesis and development of acute leukemias remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 and their significance as prognostic factors in patients with acute leukemias treated with induction chemotherapy. 103 patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were evaluated (47 females and 56 males). The median age of patients was 51 years. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, the mRNA expression of genes TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 was measured. The mRNA expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was significantly higher in patients with NR than in patients with CR and CRi. We especially observed that mRNA expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was significantly higher in patients with myelomonocytic and monoblastic acute leukemia than in patients with other types of AML. The mRNA expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was higher in AML patients than in healthy individuals, although there was no statistically significant difference. Patients with higher mRNA expression of TLR2 and TLR4 had significantly shorter OS than patients with lower mRNA expression of TLR2 and TLR4. Multivariate analysis showed that mRNA expression of TLR2 and the age of patients were independent factors associated with treatment response. Our results suggest that TLRs could be an independent prognostic factor for response rate after induction therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemias.","['Rybka, Justyna', 'Butrym, Aleksandra', 'Wrobel, Tomasz', 'Jazwiec, Bozena', 'Stefanko, Ewa', 'Dobrzynska, Olga', 'Poreba, Rafal', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz']","['Rybka J', 'Butrym A', 'Wrobel T', 'Jazwiec B', 'Stefanko E', 'Dobrzynska O', 'Poreba R', 'Kuliczkowski K']","['Department of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.

Clinical-pathological features of AL subtypes at presentation concurred with those described in the literature. A normal neutrophil count at presentation significantly prolonged ST (P = 0.027). Additionally, there was a trend for anaemic dogs to have shorter survival compared with those without anaemia, and the incorporation of cytosine in the chemotherapy protocol produced a moderate but not significant increase in median ST for dogs with AL.

These diagnostic ions can be generated using the widely adopted MS/MS approach, MS3 (Data Dependent Neutral Loss - DDNL), or by multistage activation (MSA). The main purpose of this work is to introduce a false-localization rate (FLR) probabilistic model to enable unbiased phosphoproteomics studies. Briefly, our algorithm infers a probabilistic function from the distribution of the identified phosphopeptides' XCorr Delta scores (XD-Scores) in the current experiment. Our module infers p-values by relying on Gaussian mixture models and a logistic function. We demonstrate the usefulness of our probabilistic model by revisiting the ""to MSA, or not to MSA"" dilemma. For this, we use human leukemia-derived cells (K562) as a study model and enriched for phosphopeptides using the hydroxyapatite (HAP) chromatography. The aliquots were analyzed with and without MSA on an Orbitrap-XL. Our XD-Scoring analysis revealed that the MS/MS approach provides more identifications because of its faster scan rate, but that for the same given scan rate higher-confidence spectra can be achieved with MSA. Our software is integrated into the PatternLab for proteomics freely available for academic community at http://www.patternlabforproteomics.org. Biological significance Assigning statistical confidence to phosphorylation sites is necessary for proper phosphoproteomic assessment. Here we present a rigorous statistical model, based on Gaussian mixture models and a logistic function, which overcomes shortcomings of previous tools. The algorithm described herein is made readily available to the scientific community by integrating it into the widely adopted PatternLab for proteomics.

Methotrexate is the first line recommended treatment. In case of incomplete response, cyclophosphamide may be used for hematological features but does not share the same efficacy on arthritis. We investigate the effect of rituximab in PFS as second line treatment. METHODS: This is a retrospective study about six cases of PFS treated with methotrexate and/or rituximab. RESULTS: Five women and 1 man (mean age: 66 years) were included. All patients were positive for rheumatoid factor and five were anti CCP positive. All patients presented bone erosions, three had splenomegaly. The disease duration was between 0 and 19 years at large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia diagnosis. Methotrexate was effective and well tolerated for two patients with a follow up of 7 and 4 years. For a third patient, the hematological symptoms were predominant and he received after methotrexate, several infusions of cyclophosphamide. Three patients (2 T-cell and 1 NK-cell LGLL) were treated with rituximab (two 1000 mg infusions) with a decreased DAS28 and an increased neutrophil count, with subsequent courses of rituximab one to three years later with the same efficacy. This treatment was well tolerated without infectious events after a follow up of one and three years. CONCLUSION: Methotrexate is effective in near half of cases of PFS. In second line, rituximab may be a therapeutic option with good efficacy and tolerance.","['Verhoeven, Frank', 'Guillot, Xavier', 'Prati, Clement', 'Wendling, Daniel']","['Verhoeven F', 'Guillot X', 'Prati C', 'Wendling D']","['Department of rheumatology, CHRU de Besancon, 2, Boulevard Fleming, 25030 Besancon, France.', 'Department of rheumatology, CHRU de Besancon, 2, Boulevard Fleming, 25030 Besancon, France.', 'Department of rheumatology, CHRU de Besancon, 2, Boulevard Fleming, 25030 Besancon, France.', 'Department of rheumatology, CHRU de Besancon, 2, Boulevard Fleming, 25030 Besancon, France.

BCP-ALL blasts typically retain wild type p53, and are therefore assumed to rely on indirect measures to suppress transformation-induced p53 activity. We have recently demonstrated that the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) through activation of protein kinase A (PKA) has the ability to inhibit DNA damage-induced p53 accumulation and thereby promote survival of the leukaemic blasts. Development of BCP-ALL in the bone marrow (BM) is supported by resident BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). MSCs are known to produce prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) which upon binding to its receptors is able to elicit a cAMP response in target cells. We hypothesized that PGE(2) produced by stromal cells in the BM microenvironment could stimulate cAMP production and PKA activation in BCP-ALL cells, thereby suppressing p53 accumulation and promoting survival of the malignant cells. METHODS: Primary BCP-ALL cells isolated from BM aspirates at diagnosis were cocultivated with BM-derived MSCs, and effects on DNA damage-induced p53 accumulation and cell death were monitored by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting and flow cytometry-based methods, respectively. Effects of intervention of signalling along the PGE(2)-cAMP-PKA axis were assessed by inhibition of PGE(2) production or PKA activity. Statistical significance was tested by Wilcoxon signed-rank test or paired samples t test. RESULTS: We demonstrate that BM-derived MSCs produce PGE(2) and protect primary BCP-ALL cells from p53 accumulation and apoptotic cell death. The MSC-mediated protection of DNA damage-mediated cell death is reversible upon inhibition of PGE(2) synthesis or PKA activity. Furthermore our results indicate differences in the sensitivity to variations in p53 levels between common cytogenetic subgroups of BCP-ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support our hypothesis that BM-derived PGE(2), through activation of cAMP-PKA signalling in BCP-ALL blasts, can inhibit the tumour suppressive activity of wild type p53, thereby promoting leukaemogenesis and protecting against therapy-induced leukaemic cell death. These novel findings identify the PGE(2)-cAMP-PKA signalling pathway as a possible target for pharmacological intervention with potential relevance for treatment of BCP-ALL.","['Naderi, Elin Hallan', 'Skah, Seham', 'Ugland, Hege', 'Myklebost, Ola', 'Sandnes, Dagny Lise', 'Torgersen, Maria Lyngaas', 'Josefsen, Dag', 'Ruud, Ellen', 'Naderi, Soheil', 'Blomhoff, Heidi Kiil']","['Naderi EH', 'Skah S', 'Ugland H', 'Myklebost O', 'Sandnes DL', 'Torgersen ML', 'Josefsen D', 'Ruud E', 'Naderi S', 'Blomhoff HK']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150127,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,IM,"['Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'Dinoprostone/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC4323193,,2015/01/28 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2015/01/28 06:00'],"['2014/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['s12943-014-0278-9 [pii]', '10.1186/s12943-014-0278-9 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2015 Jan 27;14:14. doi: 10.1186/s12943-014-0278-9.,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genomic profiling has highlighted the importance of the epigenetic machinery for leukemogenesis by identifying recurrent somatic mutations involving chromatin-modifier proteins. These genetic alterations function as dynamic regulators of gene expression and involve DNA-methyltransferase 3A, methyltransferase DOT1L, enhancer of zeste homologue 2, isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 and bromodomain-containing proteins. New therapeutic targets are also emerging from further delineation of cell signaling networks in acute myeloid leukemia blasts mediated by PIM kinases, polo-like kinase 1, cell surface protein CD98 and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling receptors, among others. Early results of targeted therapies directed at these molecular mechanisms are discussed in this review and their potential to improve the outcomes of patients by allowing the use of more effective and less toxic treatments.","['Carneiro, Benedito A', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Kaplan, Jason B', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert', 'Swords, Ronan', 'Platanias, Leonidas C', 'Giles, Francis J']","['Carneiro BA', 'Altman JK', 'Kaplan JB', 'Ossenkoppele G', 'Swords R', 'Platanias LC', 'Giles FJ']","['Northwestern Developmental Therapeutics Institute, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 645 N Michigan Ave. Suite 1006, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150126,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Drug Design', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation']",,,2015/01/28 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/28 06:00'],"['2015/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/14737140.2015.1004316 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2015 Apr;15(4):399-413. doi: 10.1586/14737140.2015.1004316.

Despite the rapid development of new therapies, minimal residual disease (MRD) continues to occur and leads to poor outcomes. The leukemia niche in the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) is thought to be responsible for such MRD development, which can lead to leukemia drug resistance and disease relapse. Consequently further investigation into the way in which the leukemia niche interacts with acute leukemia cells (ALCs) and development of strategies to block the underlying process are expected to improve disease prognosis. Recent studies indicated that galectin-3 (gal-3) might play a pivotal role in this process. Thus we aimed to elucidate the exact role played by gal-3 in this process and clarify its mechanism of action. METHODS: We used human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs) to mimic the leukemia BMM in vitro, and investigated their effects on drug resistance of ALCs and the possible mechanisms involved, with particular emphasis on the role of gal-3. RESULTS: In our study, we demonstrated that hBM-MSCs induced gal-3 up-regulation, promoting beta-catenin stabilization and thus activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in ALCs, which is critical in cytotoxic drug resistance of leukemia. This effect could be reversed by addition of gal-3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA). We also found that up-regulation of gal-3 promoted Akt and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta phosphorylation, thought to constitute a cross-bridge between gal-3 and Wnt signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that gal-3, a key factor mediating BMM-induced drug resistance, could be a novel therapeutic target in acute leukemia.","['Hu, Kaimin', 'Gu, Yanjun', 'Lou, Lixia', 'Liu, Lizhen', 'Hu, Yongxian', 'Wang, Binsheng', 'Luo, Yi', 'Shi, Jimin', 'Yu, Xiaohong', 'Huang, He']","['Hu K', 'Gu Y', 'Lou L', 'Liu L', 'Hu Y', 'Wang B', 'Luo Y', 'Shi J', 'Yu X', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. minkaihu@163.com.', 'Cancer Institute, The Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. minkaihu@163.com.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. 402575454@qq.com.', 'Department of Surgical Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. 402575454@qq.com.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. loulixia110@zju.edu.cn.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. 150522015@qq.com.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. 37478898@qq.com.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. 414567028@qq.com.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. 781972077@qq.com.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. 11218298@zju.edu.cn.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. 11218303@zju.edu.cn.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310003, China. hehuang.zju@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150127,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Galectin 3/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', '*Tumor Microenvironment/physiology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*physiology']",PMC4332970,,2015/01/28 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/01/28 06:00'],"['2014/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-014-0099-8 [doi]', 's13045-014-0099-8 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2015 Jan 27;8:1. doi: 10.1186/s13045-014-0099-8.,"['0 (Galectin 3)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the anticancer activities of these metabolic products. The majority of in vitro studies have investigated effects of resveratrol aglycone at supraphysiological levels. Physiological levels of resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide, resveratrol-4'-O-glucuronide, and resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, the major in vivo metabolites of dietary resveratrol, were evaluated as anticancer agents against Jurkat T leukemia cells. Propidium iodide was use to measure cell death and changes in cell cycle, and the mitochondrial membrane dye JC-1 was used to measure changes in mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry. PKH67 was used to evaluate changes in proliferation of the cells by flow cytometry. Jurkat cells were exposed to 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 muM of each resveratrol metabolite, which are concentrations achievable in vivo. None of the resveratrol metabolites were able to kill Jurkat T leukemia cells or alter cell cycle or proliferation at these concentrations. Only resveratrol-3-O-sulfate induced depolarization of mitochondrial membranes but without induction of cell death. These results suggest that the in vivo transformation of resveratrol to these glucuronide and sulfate metabolites renders these agents ineffective against T leukemia cells.","['Zunino, Susan J', 'Storms, David H']","['Zunino SJ', 'Storms DH']","['a Immunity and Disease Prevention Unit, United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service , Western Human Nutrition Research Center , Davis , California , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20150126,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Glucuronides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/metabolism/*pharmacology']",,,2015/01/27 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/27 06:00'],"['2015/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2015.989373 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2015;67(2):266-74. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2015.989373.

In patients with trisomy 21, similar somatic GATA1s-producing mutations promote transient myeloproliferative disease and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Here, we demonstrate that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with GATA1-truncating mutations exhibit impaired erythroid potential, but enhanced megakaryopoiesis and myelopoiesis, recapitulating the major phenotypes of the associated diseases. Similarly, in developmentally arrested GATA1-deficient murine megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors derived from murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs), expression of GATA1s promoted megakaryopoiesis, but not erythropoiesis. Transcriptome analysis revealed a selective deficiency in the ability of GATA1s to activate erythroid-specific genes within populations of hematopoietic progenitors. Although its DNA-binding domain was intact, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that GATA1s binding at specific erythroid regulatory regions was impaired, while binding at many nonerythroid sites, including megakaryocytic and myeloid target genes, was normal. Together, these observations indicate that lineage-specific GATA1 cofactor associations are essential for normal chromatin occupancy and provide mechanistic insights into how GATA1s mutations cause human disease.

Accordingly, TP53 mutations are reproducibly associated with poor treatment outcomes. Moreover, cytotoxic treatments destroy normal stem cells with intact p53 systems, a problem especially for myeloid neoplasms, as these cells reverse the low blood counts that cause morbidity and death. Preclinical studies suggest that noncytotoxic concentrations of the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) inhibitor decitabine produce p53-independent cell-cycle exits by reversing aberrant epigenetic repression of proliferation-terminating (MYC-antagonizing) differentiation genes in cancer cells. METHODS: In this clinical trial, patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (n=25) received reduced decitabine dosages (0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day compared with the FDA-approved 20-45 mg/m2/day dosage, a 75%-90% reduction) to avoid cytotoxicity. These well-tolerated doses were frequently administered 1-3 days per week, instead of pulse cycled for 3 to 5 days over a 4- to 6-week period, to increase the probability that cancer S-phase entries would coincide with drug exposure, which is required for S-phase-dependent DNMT1 depletion. RESULTS: The median subject age was 73 years (range, 46-85 years), 9 subjects had relapsed disease or were refractory to 5-azacytidine and/or lenalidomide, and 3 had received intensive chemoradiation to treat other cancers. Adverse events were related to neutropenia present at baseline: neutropenic fever (13 of 25 subjects) and septic death (1 of 25 subjects). Blood count improvements meeting the International Working Group criteria for response occurred in 11 of 25 (44%) subjects and were highly durable. Treatment-induced freedom from transfusion lasted a median of 1,025 days (range, 186-1,152 days; 3 ongoing), and 20% of subjects were treated for more than 3 years. Mutations and/or deletions of key apoptosis genes were frequent (present in 55% of responders and in 36% of nonresponders). Noncytotoxic DNMT1 depletion was confirmed by serial BM gamma-H2AX (DNA repair/damage marker) and DNMT1 analyses. MYC master oncoprotein levels were markedly decreased. CONCLUSION: Decitabine regimens can be redesigned to minimize cytotoxicity and increase exposure time for DNMT1 depletion, to safely and effectively circumvent mutational apoptotic defects.

Almost all BPL cells express CD19, and we recently cloned the gene encoding a natural ligand of the human CD19 receptor (CD19L). We hypothesized that fusion of CD19L to the soluble extracellular domain of proapoptotic TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL) would markedly enhance the potency of sTRAIL and specifically induce BPL cell apoptosis due to membrane anchoring of sTRAIL and simultaneous activation of the CD19 and TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R) apoptosis signaling pathways. Here, we demonstrate that recombinant human CD19L-sTRAIL was substantially more potent than sTRAIL and induced apoptosis in primary leukemia cells taken directly from BPL patients. CD19L-sTRAIL effectively targeted and eliminated in vivo clonogenic BPL xenograft cells, even at femtomolar-picomolar concentrations. In mice, CD19L-sTRAIL exhibited a more favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile than sTRAIL and was nontoxic at doses ranging from 32 fmol/kg to 3.2 pmol/kg. CD19L-sTRAIL showed potent in vivo antileukemic activity in NOD/SCID mouse xenograft models of relapsed and chemotherapy-resistant BPL at nontoxic fmol/kg dose levels.

T cell migration into such sites depends heavily on regulated adhesion and migration, but the signaling pathways that coordinate these functions downstream of chemokine receptors are largely unknown. Using conditional knockout mice, we found that T cells lacking the adaptor proteins CRK and CRK-like (CRKL) exhibit reduced integrin-dependent adhesion, chemotaxis, and diapedesis. Moreover, these two closely related proteins exhibited substantial functional redundancy, as ectopic expression of either protein rescued defects in T cells lacking both CRK and CRKL. We determined that CRK proteins coordinate with the RAP guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G and the adhesion docking molecule CASL to activate the integrin regulatory GTPase RAP1. CRK proteins were required for effector T cell trafficking into sites of inflammation, but not for migration to lymphoid organs. In a murine bone marrow transplantation model, the differential migration of CRK/CRKL-deficient T cells resulted in efficient graft-versus-leukemia responses with minimal GVHD. Together, the results from our studies show that CRK family proteins selectively regulate T cell adhesion and migration at effector sites and suggest that these proteins have potential as therapeutic targets for preventing GVHD.","['Huang, Yanping', 'Clarke, Fiona', 'Karimi, Mobin', 'Roy, Nathan H', 'Williamson, Edward K', 'Okumura, Mariko', 'Mochizuki, Kazuhiro', 'Chen, Emily J H', 'Park, Tae-Ju', 'Debes, Gudrun F', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Curran, Tom', 'Kambayashi, Taku', 'Burkhardt, Janis K']","['Huang Y', 'Clarke F', 'Karimi M', 'Roy NH', 'Williamson EK', 'Okumura M', 'Mochizuki K', 'Chen EJ', 'Park TJ', 'Debes GF', 'Zhang Y', 'Curran T', 'Kambayashi T', 'Burkhardt JK']",,['eng'],"['T32 CA009140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL111501/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI065644/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR056730/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 TCA009140/PHS HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007775/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL107589/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AR056780/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 AR057577/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150126,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/physiology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chemotaxis', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/metabolism', 'Inflammation/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-crk/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology/transplantation', 'Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",PMC4362242,,2015/01/27 06:00,2015/05/13 06:00,['2015/01/27 06:00'],"['2014/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['77278 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI77278 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2015 Mar 2;125(3):1019-32. doi: 10.1172/JCI77278.

In this pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the usability of archival bone marrow smears and biopsies for DNA extraction and purification, whole genome amplification (WGA), multiple marker analysis including 10 short tandem repeats, and finally a comprehensive genotyping of 33,683 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multiplexed targeted next-generation sequencing. A total of 73 samples from 21 bone marrow smears and 13 bone marrow biopsies from 18 Danish and Norwegian childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients were included and compared with corresponding blood samples. Samples were grouped according to the age of sample and whether WGA was performed or not. We found that measurements of DNA concentration after DNA extraction was dependent on detection method and that spectrophotometry overestimated DNA amount compared with fluorometry. In the short tandem repeat analysis, detection rate dropped slightly with longer fragments. After WGA, this drop was more pronounced. Samples stored for 0 to 3 years showed better results compared with samples stored for 4 to 10 years. Acceptable call rates for SNPs were detected for 7 of 42 archival samples. In conclusion, archival bone marrow samples are suitable for DNA extraction and multiple marker analysis, but WGA was less successful, especially when longer fragments were analyzed.

Cordycepin, an adenosine derivative, differs from adenosine in that its ribose lacks an oxygen atom at the 3' position. Several research groups have reported that cordycepin has antiviral activity against several viruses including influenza virus, plant viruses, human immunodeficiency virus(HIV), murine leukemia virus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In this study, we identify the epigenetic mechanisms by which cordycepin exerts its anti-gammaherpesvirus effects. We show that cordycepin possesses antitumor and antiviral activity against gastric carcinoma and EBV, respectively. A comparison of the CD50 values of cordycepin and its analogs showed that the lack of a 2'-hydroxyl group in cordycepin was critical for its relatively potent cytotoxicity. Cordycepin treatment decreased the rate of early apoptosis in SNU719 cells by up to 64%, but increased late apoptosis/necrosis by up to 31%. Interestingly, cordycepin increased BCL7A methylation in SNU719 cells by up to 58% and decreased demethylation by up to 37%. Consistent with these changes in methylation, cordycepin treatment significantly downregulated most EBV genes tested. Under the same conditions, cordycepin significantly decreased the frequency of Q and F promoter usage, and H3K4me3 histone enrichment was significantly reduced at several important EBV genomic loci. Extracellular and intracellular EBV genome copy numbers were reduced by up to 55% and 30%, respectively, in response to 125 muM cordycepin treatment. Finally, cordycepin significantly suppressed the transfer of EBV from LCL-EBV-GFP to AGS cells, indicating that EBV infection of gastric epithelial cells was inhibited. These results suggest that cordycepin has antiviral and antitumor activities against gammaherpesviruses and host cells latently infected with virus.","['Ryu, Eunhyun', 'Son, Myoungki', 'Lee, Minjung', 'Lee, Kanghyo', 'Cho, Jae Youl', 'Cho, Sungchan', 'Lee, Suk Kyeong', 'Lee, You Mie', 'Cho, Hyosun', 'Sung, Gi-Ho', 'Kang, Hyojeung']","['Ryu E', 'Son M', 'Lee M', 'Lee K', 'Cho JY', 'Cho S', 'Lee SK', 'Lee YM', 'Cho H', 'Sung GH', 'Kang H']","['College of Pharmacy and Institute of microorganisms, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Institute of microorganisms, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Institute of microorganisms, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Mushroom Research Division, National Institute of Horticultural and Herbal Science, Rural Development Administration, Eumseong, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Genetic Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea.', 'Targeted Medicine Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Cheongwon, Chungbuk, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Institute of Immunobiology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy and Institute of microorganisms, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', ""College of Pharmacy, Duksung Women's University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Institute for Bio-Medical Convergence, International St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic Kwangdong University, Incheon, Republic of Korea."", 'College of Pharmacy and Institute of microorganisms, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141218,United States,Oncoscience,Oncoscience,101636666,,,PMC4303894,,2015/01/27 06:00,2015/01/27 06:01,['2015/01/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.18632/oncoscience.110 [doi]'],epublish,Oncoscience. 2014 Dec 18;1(12):866-881. doi: 10.18632/oncoscience.110. eCollection 2014.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cordycepin', 'Epstein-Barr virus', 'antiviral agent', 'gastric carcinoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of the mTOR pathway has been related to tumorigenesis, poor prognosis and/or chemotherapy resistance in a variety of malignancies. Inhibition of mTORC1 by Rapamycin and its analogs has been explored to treat a number of tumors. However, the effectiveness of patient response is limited and not all patients respond. Second generation of mTOR inhibitors have recently been developed to target mTOR kinase activity and to suppress both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors generally are more efficacious in preclinical studies and clinical trials. We and others have recently found that dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors sensitize T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia and rhabdomyosarcoma cells to DNA damaging agents by suppression of expression of FANCD2 of the Fanconi anemia pathway, an important DNA repair mechanism that is associated with drug resistance of multiple types of cancer.

The cancer counterparts of normal stem and progenitor cells might be occurred through alterations of stem cell fates including an increase in self-renewal capability and a decrease in differentiation and/or apoptosis. This oncogenic evolution of cancer stem and progenitor cells, which often associates with aggressive phenotypes of the tumorigenic cells, is controlled in part by dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms including aberrant DNA methylation leading to abnormal epigenetic memory. Epigenetic therapy by targeting DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) 1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B via 5-Azacytidine (Aza) and 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Aza-dC) has proved to be successful toward treatment of hematologic neoplasms especially for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. In this review, I summarize the current knowledge of mechanisms underlying the inhibition of DNA methylation by Aza and Aza-dC, and of their apoptotic- and differentiation-inducing effects on cancer stem and progenitor cells in leukemia, medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and testicular germ cell tumors.

RESULTS: A complete cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic analysis; molecular biology methods such as quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) and allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO)-PCR; and immunophenotypically confirmed CML in acceleration phase (AP). Our case revealed the presence of hyperdiploidy including multiple copies of the Ph chromosome, presence of b3a2 fusion transcript,T315I mutation in BCR-ABL KD in pre imatinib mesylate (IM) treatment.

The frequency and the specificity of HPA antibodies after a series of blood transfusions have never been reported in the Algerian population which is ethnically diverse and runs a higher risk of platelet alloimmunization due to high b allelic frequencies observed for the HPA systems. METHODS: 117 polytransfused patients were included in this study; the detection of HPA antibodies was performed by the Monoclonal Antibody-specific Immobilization of Platelet Antigens method (MAIPA). Post-transfusion platelet effectiveness was evaluated by the calculation of corrected count increment (CCI). RESULTS: The antibodies against platelets were detected in 10.26% of the patients. In this study, the platelet systems concerned by the alloimmunizations were specifically HPA-1, -3 and -5 with particular predominance of HPA-1. Twenty two patients were refractory to platelet transfusion, as assessed by a CCI; in which 64% have factors associated with increased platelet consumption. Platelet Immunization was found in 14% of platelet refractoriness (PTR) cases. 03 Anti-platelet antibodies were directed against GPIb-IX (n = 1), anti-HPA-1b (n = 1) and anti HPA-5b (n = 1) associated with anti-HLA antibodies in two cases. CONCLUSION: HLA and HPA alloimmunization is common among chronically transfused patients. PTR detection, identification of the underlying causes, and selection of the appropriate product for transfusion are fundamental to reduce the risk of major bleedings.","['Brouk, Hacene', 'Bertrand, Gerald', 'Zitouni, Selma', 'Djenouni, Amel', 'Martageix, Corinne', 'Griffi, Fatiha', 'Kaplan, Cecile', 'Ouelaa, Hanifa']","['Brouk H', 'Bertrand G', 'Zitouni S', 'Djenouni A', 'Martageix C', 'Griffi F', 'Kaplan C', 'Ouelaa H']","['Service of Blood Transfusion and Hemobiology, University Hospital Center of Annaba, Annaba, Algeria; Faculty of Medicine, University Badji Mokhtar of Annaba, Annaba, Algeria.

A retrospective chart review included all de novo AML patients (excluding M3) at Kansas University Medical Center (KUMC) from January 2008 through April 2013. Records were evaluated for completeness of molecular testing as indicated by karyotype (FLT3, CEBPalpha, NPM1 in normal cytogenetics AML and c-KIT in core binding factor [CBF] AML). 271 charts were reviewed: 98 with CN-AML and 29 with CBF AML. Seventy were diagnosed at KUMC, 57 at a community site. Molecular testing was sent in 76/98 (77%) patients with CN-AML. Patients diagnosed at KUMC had a significantly higher rate of molecular testing (51/55, 93%) as compared to those diagnosed at outside centers (18/43, 41%) (P < 0.001). Of 29 patients with CBF AML, c-kit mutational analysis was performed more frequently at KUMC (14/15, 93%) than in community sites (8/14, 57%) (P = 0.035). There was a trend towards increased testing at both KUMC and community sites in later years. Rates of molecular testing in AML were higher in an academic center versus community sites in the 5 years following the World Health Organization revised classification of AML.

Twenty hours post-invasion sporozoites develop into multi-nucleated macroschizonts that transform the infected macrophage into an immortalized, permanently proliferating, hyper-invasive and disease-causing leukaemia-like cell. Once immortalized Theileria-infected leukocytes can be propagated as cell lines and even though cultivated under normoxic conditions, both infected B cells and macrophages display sustained activation of HIF-1alpha. Attenuated macrophages used as live vaccines against tropical theileriosis also display HIF-1alpha activation even though they have lost their tumorigenic phenotype. Here, we review data that ascribes HIF-1alpha activation to the proliferation status of the infected leukocyte and discuss the possibility that Theileria may have lost its ability to render its host macrophage virulent due to continuous parasite replication in a high Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) environment. We propose a model where uninfected macrophages have low levels of H2 O2 output, whereas virulent-infected macrophages produce high amounts of H2 O2 . Further increase in H2 O2 output leads to dampening of infected macrophage virulence, a characteristic of disease-resistant macrophages. At the same time exposure to H2 O2 sustains HIF-1alpha that induces the switch from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to Warburg glycolysis, a metabolic shift that underpins uncontrolled infected macrophage proliferation. We propose that as macroschizonts develop into merozoites and infected macrophage proliferation arrests, HIF-1alpha levels will decrease and glycolysis will switch back from Warburg to oxidative glycolysis. As Theileria infection transforms its host leukocyte into an aggressive leukaemic-like cell, we propose that manipulating ROS levels, HIF-1alpha induction and oxidative over Warburg glycolysis could contribute to improved disease control. Finally, as excess amounts of H2 O2 drive virulent Theileria-infected macrophages towards attenuation it highlights how infection-induced pathology and redox balance are intimately linked.","['Metheni, Mehdi', 'Lombes, Anne', 'Bouillaud, Frederic', 'Batteux, Frederic', 'Langsley, Gordon']","['Metheni M', 'Lombes A', 'Bouillaud F', 'Batteux F', 'Langsley G']","['Inserm U1016, Cnrs UMR8104, Cochin Institute, Paris, France; Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Comparative des Apicomplexes, Faculte de Medicine, Universite Paris Descartes - Sorbonne Paris Cite, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150226,England,Cell Microbiol,Cellular microbiology,100883691,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Glycolysis', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism/*parasitology', 'Models, Biological', 'Theileria annulata/*growth & development']",,,2015/01/27 06:00,2015/11/11 06:00,['2015/01/27 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cmi.12421 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Microbiol. 2015 Apr;17(4):467-72. doi: 10.1111/cmi.12421.

The rate of adoption of adjuvant hormonal therapy alone in lieu of radiation therapy (RT) and its associated patterns of care is not known in the United States and was the subject of this study. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used the National Cancer Data Base to identify women aged >/=70 diagnosed with T1N0/T1Nx invasive breast cancer who underwent segmental mastectomy between 1998 and 2011. Because hormone receptor status was not specifically and reliably coded, only those who received hormonal therapy were included in this analysis. Univariate and multivariable exploratory analyses of factors associated with the use of RT were performed using SPSS, version 17.0. RESULTS: Of the 182,115 patients who met inclusion criteria, 97,530 (53.6%) patients underwent hormonal therapy and were included in the analysis. The RT utilization rate in this subset decreased with time from 84.9% in 1998 to 75.1% in 2011 (P< .001). Multivariable analysis revealed that the factors associated with decreased use of RT include (in order of association): older age, later year of diagnosis, greater comorbidity score, low grade, lack of insurance, treatment at academic facility, race, rural location, lower median income, and distance from facility. CONCLUSIONS: This study assesses the patterns of care associated with the omission of RT in elderly women with early-stage breast cancer who received adjuvant hormonal therapy. Since the publication of major clinical trials, this strategy has been increasingly adopted. The strongest predictors of using this strategy included advanced patient age, high comorbidity score, and low-grade disease.","['Rhieu, Byung-Han', 'Rajagopalan, Malolan S', 'Sukumvanich, Paniti', 'Kelley, Joseph L', 'Ahrendt, Gretchen M', 'Heron, Dwight E', 'Beriwal, Sushil']","['Rhieu BH', 'Rajagopalan MS', 'Sukumvanich P', 'Kelley JL', 'Ahrendt GM', 'Heron DE', 'Beriwal S']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Gynecologic Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

We previously demonstrated that CD204 was a useful marker for TAMs contributing to the angiogenesis, progression, and prognosis of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We also showed that conditioned media of ESCC cell lines induced CD204 expression in THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells. Here, we performed a cDNA microarray analysis between THP-1 cells stimulated with TPA (macrophage [MPhi]-like THP-1 cells) treated with and without conditioned medium of ESCC cell line to clarify the molecular characteristics of TAMs in ESCC. From the microarray data, we discovered that Cyr61 was induced in CD204-positive-differentiated THP-1 cells (TAM-like THP-1 cells). In the ESCC microenvironment, not only cancer cells but also TAMs expressed Cyr61. Interestingly, the expression levels of Cyr61 showed a significant positive correlation with the number of CD204-positive macrophages in ESCCs by immunohistochemistry. Recombinant human Cyr61 (rhCyr61) promoted cell migration and induced the expression of CD204 along with the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in MPhi-like THP-1 cells. Pretreatment with a MEK1/2 inhibitor significantly inhibited not only the Cyr61-mediated migration but also the CD204 expression in the MPhi-like THP-1 cells. These results suggest that Cyr61 may contribute to the expression of CD204 and the promotion of cell migration via the MEK/ERK pathway in TAMs in the ESCC microenvironment.","['Shigeoka, Manabu', 'Urakawa, Naoki', 'Nishio, Mari', 'Takase, Nobuhisa', 'Utsunomiya, Soken', 'Akiyama, Hiroaki', 'Kakeji, Yoshihiro', 'Komori, Takahide', 'Koma, Yu-ichiro', 'Yokozaki, Hiroshi']","['Shigeoka M', 'Urakawa N', 'Nishio M', 'Takase N', 'Utsunomiya S', 'Akiyama H', 'Kakeji Y', 'Komori T', 'Koma Y', 'Yokozaki H']","['Division of Pathology, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan; Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150126,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cysteine-Rich Protein 61/genetics/*metabolism', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Macrophages/metabolism/*physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class A/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4380969,,2015/01/27 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2015/01/27 06:00'],"['2014/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cam4.401 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2015 Mar;4(3):437-46. doi: 10.1002/cam4.401.

KLHL20 is a BTB-family protein and targets tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) to its kelch-repeat domain for ubiquitination and degradation. Here, we show that another BTB-kelch protein KLHL39 is recruited to the substrate-binding domain of KLHL20 but is not a substrate of Cul3-KLHL20 complex. Interestingly, KLHL39 does not bind Cul3 because of the absence of certain conserved residues in the BTB domain. Instead, KLHL39 blocks KLHL20-mediated ubiquitination of PML and DAPK by disrupting the binding of these substrates to KLHL20 as well as the binding of KLHL20 to Cul3. Through the two mechanisms, KLHL39 increases the stability of PML and DAPK. In human colon cancers, downregulations of KLHL39, PML and DAPK are associated with metastatic progression. Furthermore, preclinical data indicate that KLHL39 promotes colon cancer migration, invasion and survival in vitro and metastasis in vivo through a PML- and DAPK-dependent mechanism. Our study identifies KLHL39 as a negative regulator of Cul3-KLHL20 ubiquitin ligase and reveals a role of KLHL39-mediated PML and DAPK stabilization in colon cancer metastasis.","['Chen, H Y', 'Hu, J Y', 'Chen, T H', 'Lin, Y C', 'Liu, X', 'Lin, M Y', 'Lang, Y D', 'Yen, Y', 'Chen, R H']","['Chen HY', 'Hu JY', 'Chen TH', 'Lin YC', 'Liu X', 'Lin MY', 'Lang YD', 'Yen Y', 'Chen RH']","['Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Cancer Biology and Drug Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biochemical Sciences, College of Life Science, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150126,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",,,2015/01/27 06:00,2016/01/06 06:00,['2015/01/27 06:00'],"['2014/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/23 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2014435 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.435 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Oct 1;34(40):5141-51. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.435.

Our review focuses on the evolution of antibody therapy in CLL, strategies to target effector T cells to the tumor, inhibition of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, and finally targeting the mediators of apoptosis.

We searched PubMed database, Embase database, CNKI database, Wanfang database, and Weipu database, covering all studies until August 7, 2013. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Revman4.2 software and the Stata10.0 software. A total of 27 case-control studies concerning the Arg399Gln polymorphism were included from 26 articles. The results suggested that the Arg399Gln polymorphism was not associated with an increased/decreased risk of hematological malignancies in total analysis (OR = 1.15, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.97-1.35, P = 0.10 for Arg/Gln + Gln/Gln vs. Arg/Arg).

The aim of this study was to examine whether H2AX phosphorylation was required for resveratrol-induced apoptosis of human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells in vitro. METHODS: K562 cells were tested. Cell apoptosis was analyzed using flow cytometry, and the phosphorylation of H2AX and other signaling proteins was examined with Western blotting. To analyze the signaling pathways, the cells were transfected with lentiviral vectors encoding H2AX-wt or specific siRNAs. RESULTS: Treatment of K562 cells with resveratrol (20-100 mumol/L) induced apoptosis and phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser139 in time- and dose-dependent manners, but reduced phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10. Resveratrol treatment activated two MAPK family members p38 and JNK, and blocked the activation of another MAPK family member ERK. Pretreatment with the p38 inhibitor SB202190 or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 dose-dependently reduced resveratrol-induced phosphorylation of H2AX, which were also observed when the cells were transfected with p38- or JNK-specific siRNAs. Overexpression of H2AX in K562 cells markedly increased resveratrol-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of H2AX-139m (Ser139 was mutated to block phosphorylation) inhibited resveratrol-induced apoptosis. K562 cells transfected with H2AX-specific siRNAs were resistant to resveratrol-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: H2AX phosphorylation at Ser139 in human CML cells, which is regulated by p38 and JNK, is essential for resveratrol-induced apoptosis.","['Wu, Xin-pin', 'Xiong, Min', 'Xu, Cheng-shan', 'Duan, Lian-ning', 'Dong, Ya-qiong', 'Luo, Yuan', 'Niu, Tian-hui', 'Lu, Cheng-rong']","['Wu XP', 'Xiong M', 'Xu CS', 'Duan LN', 'Dong YQ', 'Luo Y', 'Niu TH', 'Lu CR']","['1] Clinical School of Air Force General Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Heifei 230000, China [2] Aviation Medicine Research Laboratory, Air Force General Hospital, PLA, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Aviation Medicine Research Laboratory, Air Force General Hospital, PLA, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Aviation Medicine Research Laboratory, Air Force General Hospital, PLA, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Aviation Medicine Research Laboratory, Air Force General Hospital, PLA, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Aviation Medicine Research Laboratory, Air Force General Hospital, PLA, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Aviation Medicine Research Laboratory, Air Force General Hospital, PLA, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Aviation Medicine Research Laboratory, Air Force General Hospital, PLA, Beijing 100142, China.', '1] Clinical School of Air Force General Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Heifei 230000, China [2] Aviation Medicine Research Laboratory, Air Force General Hospital, PLA, Beijing 100142, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150126,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Resveratrol', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",PMC4349923,,2015/01/27 06:00,2016/03/29 06:00,['2015/01/27 06:00'],"['2014/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['aps2014132 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2014.132 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2015 Mar;36(3):353-61. doi: 10.1038/aps.2014.132.

METHODS: Human BM samples were obtained from 9 patients with acute or chronic myeloid leukemias and 2 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) were isolated and cultured. Cell viability was determined using MTT assay, and apoptosis was examined with PI staining or flow cytometry. ROS levels in the cells were determined using DCFH-DA staining and flow cytometry. Expression of apoptotic and autophagic signaling proteins was analyzed using Western blotting. RESULTS: PL inhibited the viability of BMMNCs from the patients with myeloid leukemias (with IC50 less than 20 mumol/L), but not that of BMMNCs from a patient with MDS. Furthermore, PL (10 and 20 mumol/L) induced apoptosis of BMMNCs from the patients with myeloid leukemias in a dose-dependent manner. PL markedly increased ROS levels in BMMNCs from the patients with myeloid leukemias, whereas pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine abolished PL-induced ROS accumulation and effectively reduced PL-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, PL markedly increased the expression of the apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3) and autophagic proteins (Beclin-1 and LC3B), and phosphorylation of p38 and JNK in BMMNCs from the patients with myeloid leukemias, whereas pretreatment with the specific p38 inhibitor SB203580 or the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 partially reversed PL-induced ROS production, apoptotic/autophagic signaling activation and cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Piperlongumine induces apoptotic and autophagic death of the primary myeloid leukemia cells from patients via activation of ROS-p38/JNK pathways.","['Xiong, Xin-xin', 'Liu, Ju-mei', 'Qiu, Xin-yao', 'Pan, Feng', 'Yu, Shang-bin', 'Chen, Xiao-qian']","['Xiong XX', 'Liu JM', 'Qiu XY', 'Pan F', 'Yu SB', 'Chen XQ']","['Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine; Key Laboratory of Neurological Diseases, Ministry of Education; Institute of Brain Research, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine; Key Laboratory of Neurological Diseases, Ministry of Education; Institute of Brain Research, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine; Key Laboratory of Neurological Diseases, Ministry of Education; Institute of Brain Research, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', '1] Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine; Key Laboratory of Neurological Diseases, Ministry of Education; Institute of Brain Research, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China [2] Department of Urology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine; Key Laboratory of Neurological Diseases, Ministry of Education; Institute of Brain Research, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medicine; Key Laboratory of Neurological Diseases, Ministry of Education; Institute of Brain Research, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150126,United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dioxolanes/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",PMC4349924,,2015/01/27 06:00,2016/03/29 06:00,['2015/01/27 06:00'],"['2014/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['aps2014141 [pii]', '10.1038/aps.2014.141 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2015 Mar;36(3):362-74. doi: 10.1038/aps.2014.141.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-citrate lyase, which metabolizes citrate, has been shown to be essential for inflammation, but the ability of exogenous citrate to impact inflammatory signalling cascades remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that citrate would modulate inflammatory responses as both a cellular metabolite and calcium chelator, and tested this hypothesis by determining how clinically relevant levels of citrate modulate monocyte proinflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a human acute monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1). In normal medium (0.4 mM calcium), citrate inhibited LPS-induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8 transcripts, whereas in medium supplemented with calcium (1.4 mM), TNF-alpha and IL-8 levels increased and appeared independent of calcium chelation. Using an IL-8-luciferase plasmid construct, the same increased response was observed in the activation of the IL-8 promoter region, suggesting transcriptional regulation. Tricarballylic acid, an inhibitor of ATP-citrate lyase, blocked the ability of citrate to augment TNF-alpha, linking citrate's augmentation effect with its metabolism by ATP-citrate lyase. In the presence of citrate, increased histone acetylation was observed in the TNF-alpha and IL-8 promoter regions of THP-1 cells. We observed that citrate can both augment and inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production via modulation of inflammatory gene transactivation. These findings suggest that citrate anti-coagulation may alter immune function through complex interactions with the inflammatory response.","['Ashbrook, M J', 'McDonough, K L', 'Pituch, J J', 'Christopherson, P L', 'Cornell, T T', 'Selewski, D T', 'Shanley, T P', 'Blatt, N B']","['Ashbrook MJ', 'McDonough KL', 'Pituch JJ', 'Christopherson PL', 'Cornell TT', 'Selewski DT', 'Shanley TP', 'Blatt NB']","['Divisions of Pediatric Nephrology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Pediatric Critical Care, Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Divisions of Pediatric Nephrology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Divisions of Pediatric Nephrology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Pediatric Critical Care, Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Divisions of Pediatric Nephrology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Pediatric Critical Care, Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Divisions of Pediatric Nephrology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['K08 DK093785/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HD062142/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'K08DK093785/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08HD062142/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150419,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Calcium/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Citric Acid/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*immunology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4449780,,2015/01/27 06:00,2015/08/12 06:00,['2015/01/27 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cei.12591 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2015 Jun;180(3):520-30. doi: 10.1111/cei.12591.

METHODS: Proliferative inhibition rate and the reversal index (RI) of bufalin were determined by Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. The uptake of Adriamycin (ADM) in K562/VCR cells, cell cycle and apoptosis rate were determined by flow cytometry (FCM). Cell morphologic changes were observed with Wright-Giemsa staining. The expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug-associated protein-1 (MRP1), Bcl-xL and Bax protein were measured by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: The human leukemia multidrug resistant K562/VCR cells showed no cross-resistance to bufalin. The RIs of bufalin at concentrations of 0.0002, 0.001 and 0.005 mumol/L were 4.85, 6.94 and 14.77, respectively. Preincubation of 0.001 mumol/L bufalin for 2 h could increase intracellular ADM fluorescence intensity to 28.07% (P < 0.05) and down-regulate MRP1 expression simultaneously, but no remarkable effect was found on P-gp protein. Cell cycle analysis indicated increased apoptosis rate and apparent decreased G2/M phase proportion after treatment with bufalin. When exposed to 0.01 mumol/L bufalin, typical morphological changes of apoptosis could be observed. Down-regulation of Bcl-xL and up-regulation of Bax expression in K562/VCR cells could be detected by immunocytochemistry. CONCLUSION: Bufalin could partly reverse the MDR of K562/VCR cells, with a possible mechanism of down-regulating MRP1 expression and activating apoptosis pathway by altering Bcl-xL/Bax ratio.","['Zhai, Xiaofeng', 'Lu, Jianying', 'Wang, Ying', 'Fang, Fanfu', 'Li, Bai', 'Gu, Wei']","['Zhai X', 'Lu J', 'Wang Y', 'Fang F', 'Li B', 'Gu W']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,J Tradit Chin Med,Journal of traditional Chinese medicine = Chung i tsa chih ying wen pan,8211546,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bufanolides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,,2015/01/27 06:00,2015/03/04 06:00,['2015/01/27 06:00'],"['2015/01/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1016/s0254-6272(15)30082-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Tradit Chin Med. 2014 Dec;34(6):678-83. doi: 10.1016/s0254-6272(15)30082-0.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Bufanolides)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'U549S98QLW (bufalin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ambient benzene levels at four background sites in China's most developed coastal regions were measured from March 2012 to February 2013. The sites are: SYNECP, in the Northeast China Plain (NECP); YCNCP, in the North China Plain (NCP); THYRD, in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and DHPRD, in the Pearl River Delta (PRD). It was found that the mean annual benzene levels (578-1297 ppt) at the background sites were alarmingly higher, especially when compared to those of 60-480 pptv monitored in 28 cities in the United States. Wintertime benzene levels were significantly elevated at both sites (SYNECP and YCNCP) in northern China due to heating with coal/biofuels. Even at these background sites, the lifetime cancer risks of benzene (1.7-3.7E-05) all exceeded 1E-06 set by USEPA as acceptable for adults. At both sites in northern China, good correlations between benzene and CO or chloromethane, together with much lower toluene/benzene (T/B) ratios, suggested that benzene was largely related to coal combustion and biomass/biofuel burning. At the DHPRD site in the PRD, benzene revealed a highly significant correlation with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), indicating that its source was predominantly from vehicle emissions. At the THYRD site in the YRD, higher T/B ratios and correlations between benzene and tetrachloroethylene, or MTBE, implied that benzene levels were probably affected by both traffic-related and industrial emissions.","['Zhang, Zhou', 'Wang, Xinming', 'Zhang, Yanli', 'Lu, Sujun', 'Huang, Zhonghui', 'Huang, Xinyu', 'Wang, Yuesi']","['Zhang Z', 'Wang X', 'Zhang Y', 'Lu S', 'Huang Z', 'Huang X', 'Wang Y']","['Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.', 'Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China.

Tregs, particularly CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells, have been reported to be involved in the immune evasion mechanism of tumors and several pathogens that cause chronic infections. Recent studies showed that a Treg-associated marker, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), is closely associated with the progression of several diseases. We recently reported that the proportion of Foxp3(+)CD4(+) cells was positively correlated with the number of lymphocytes, virus titer, and virus load but inversely correlated with IFN-gamma expression in cattle infected with bovine leukemia virus (BLV), which causes chronic infection and lymphoma in its host. Here the kinetics of CTLA-4(+) cells were analyzed in BLV-infected cattle. CTLA-4 mRNA was predominantly expressed in CD4(+) T cells in BLV-infected cattle, and the expression was positively correlated with Foxp3 mRNA expression. To test for differences in the protein expression level of CTLA-4, we measured the proportion of CTLA-4-expressing cells by flow cytometry. In cattle with persistent lymphocytosis (PL), mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of CTLA-4 on CD4(+) and CD25(+) T cells were significantly increased compared with that in control and aleukemic (AL) cattle. The percentage of CTLA-4(+) cells in the CD4(+) T cell subpopulation was positively correlated with TGF-beta mRNA expression, suggesting that CD4(+)CTLA-4(+) T cells have a potentially immunosuppressive function in BLV infection. In the limited number of cattle that were tested, the anti-CTLA-4 antibody enhanced the expression of CD69, IL-2, and IFN-gamma mRNA in anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from BLV-infected cattle.

But many methods are limited to certain groups of patients. We present a comparison of two markers which are universally applicable: WT1 expression and chimerism status. METHODS: We analyzed 1,848 peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of 148 children, adolescents and young adults with malignant hematological diseases. Median follow-up time was 739 days after transplantation. RESULTS: All patients suffering from hematological relapse showed high WT1 levels. Approximately half (51%) of the 37 relapses could have been detected early through an increase in WT1 expression. WT1 kinetics revealed to be more specific than single elevated WT1 levels (p < 0.05) and chimerism analysis (p < 0.05). Combined with chimerism analysis, 74% of relapses were detectable in advance. Elevated WT1 expression levels after transplantation reached the highest sensitivity (64.9%) as a single marker, although differences were not significant. When the dynamics of both markers as well as any elevated WT1 expression were taken into account, a sensitivity of 81.5% and a specificity of 83.7% were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, we conclude that WT1 is a useful marker for monitoring of minimal residual disease after transplantation, if specific targets are not available. WT1 expression and chimerism status should be mutually evaluated to decide about immunotherapeutic interventions aimed at preventing morphological relapse.","['Woehlecke, Caroline', 'Wittig, Susan', 'Sanft, Juliane', 'Kreyenberg, Hermann', 'Gruhn, Bernd']","['Woehlecke C', 'Wittig S', 'Sanft J', 'Kreyenberg H', 'Gruhn B']","['Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Kochstr. 2, 07745, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150124,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chimerism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Recurrence', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/01/27 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2015/01/25 06:00'],"['2014/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-015-1919-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2015 Jul;141(7):1283-90. doi: 10.1007/s00432-015-1919-0.

Fluoroquinolones appear to be most effective and well tolerated. Thus, in April 2008, we changed our antibiotic prophylaxis regimen from cotrimoxazole/colistin (COT/COL) to the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin (CIP) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The aim of this retrospective study was to compare efficacy and development of bacterial resistance with two different prophylaxis regimens over a time period of more than 4 years. METHODS: Induction chemotherapy courses given for AML during the antibiotic prophylaxis period with COT/COL (01/2006-04/2008) and CIP (04/2008-06/2010) were retrospectively analyzed with a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: Eighty-five courses in the COT/COL group and 105 in the CIP group were analyzed. The incidence of fever was not significantly different (COT/COL 80 % vs CIP 77 %; p = 0.724). Also, the rate of microbiologically documented infections was nearly the same (29 vs 26 %; p = 0.625). In addition, there was no significant difference in the incidence of clinically documented infections (11 vs 19 %; p = 0.155) or in the rates of detected gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Of note, there was no increase in resistance rates or cases with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in the CIP group. CONCLUSION: The antibiotic prophylaxis with CIP compared to COT/COL in AML was similarly effective with no increase in bacterial resistance. COT/COL may have the advantages of providing additional prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and leaving fluoroquinolones as an additional option for treatment of febrile neutropenia.","['Mayer, Karin', 'Hahn-Ast, Corinna', 'Muckter, Sara', 'Schmitz, Andrea', 'Krause, Simon', 'Felder, Linda', 'Bekeredjian-Ding, Isabelle', 'Molitor, Ernst', 'Brossart, Peter', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal, Marie']","['Mayer K', 'Hahn-Ast C', 'Muckter S', 'Schmitz A', 'Krause S', 'Felder L', 'Bekeredjian-Ding I', 'Molitor E', 'Brossart P', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal M']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Hamatologie/Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Str. 25, 53105, Bonn, Germany, karin.mayer@ukb.uni-bonn.de.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20150124,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/*methods', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*prevention & control', 'Ciprofloxacin/*therapeutic use', 'Clostridioides difficile/drug effects', 'Colistin/*therapeutic use', 'Diarrhea/microbiology/prevention & control', '*Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Fever/drug therapy', 'Fluoroquinolones/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Pneumocystis carinii/drug effects', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/*therapeutic use']",,,2015/01/27 06:00,2015/06/18 06:00,['2015/01/25 06:00'],"['2014/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-015-2621-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2015 May;23(5):1321-9. doi: 10.1007/s00520-015-2621-0.

T cell-rich lesions have rarely been described. OBJECTIVE: We report a series of 6 patients with cutaneous borreliosis presenting with T cell-predominant skin infiltrates. METHODS: We studied the clinicopathologic and molecular features of 6 patients with T cell-rich skin infiltrates. RESULTS: Half of the patients had erythematous patchy, partly annular lesions, and the other patients had features of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. Histopathology revealed a dense, band-like or diffuse dermal infiltrate. Apart from small, well differentiated lymphocytes, there were medium-sized lymphocytes with slight nuclear atypia and focal epidermotropism. An interstitial histiocytic component was found in 4 cases, including histiocytic pseudorosettes. Fibrosis was present in all cases but varied in severity and distribution. In 5 patients, borrelia DNA was detected in lesional tissue using polymerase chain reaction studies. No monoclonal rearrangement of T-cell receptor gamma genes was found. LIMITATIONS: This retrospective study was limited by the small number of patients. CONCLUSION: In addition to unusual clinical presentation, cutaneous borreliosis can histopathologically manifest with a T cell-rich infiltrate mimicking cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Awareness of this clinicopathologic constellation is important to prevent underrecognition of this rare and unusual presentation representing a Borrelia-associated T-cell pseudolymphoma.","['Kempf, Werner', 'Kazakov, Dmitry V', 'Hubscher, Eugen', 'Gugerli, Oliver', 'Gerbig, Andreas W', 'Schmid, Regula', 'Palmedo, Gabriele', 'Kutzner, Heinz']","['Kempf W', 'Kazakov DV', 'Hubscher E', 'Gugerli O', 'Gerbig AW', 'Schmid R', 'Palmedo G', 'Kutzner H']","['Kempf und Pfaltz, Histologische Diagnostik, Zurich, Switzerland.

We previously established that stable expression of kinase dead protein kinase C alpha in hematopoietic progenitor cells resulted in the development of a chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like disease in mice. Here we demonstrate that this chronic lymphocytic leukemia model resembles the more aggressive subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, expressing predominantly unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain genes, with upregulated tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 expression and elevated ERK-MAPK-mTor signaling, resulting in enhanced proliferation and increased tumor load in lymphoid organs. Reduced function of PKCalpha leads to an up-regulation of PKCbetaII expression, which is also associated with a poor prognostic subset of human chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples. Treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like cells with the selective PKCbeta inhibitor enzastaurin caused cell cycle arrest and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, and a reduction in the leukemic burden in vivo. These results demonstrate the importance of PKCbetaII in chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like disease progression and suggest a role for PKCalpha subversion in creating permissive conditions for leukemogenesis.","['Nakagawa, Rinako', 'Vukovic, Milica', 'Tarafdar, Anuradha', 'Cosimo, Emilio', 'Dunn, Karen', 'McCaig, Alison M', 'Holroyd, Ailsa', 'McClanahan, Fabienne', 'Ramsay, Alan G', 'Gribben, John G', 'Michie, Alison M']","['Nakagawa R', 'Vukovic M', 'Tarafdar A', 'Cosimo E', 'Dunn K', 'McCaig AM', 'Holroyd A', 'McClanahan F', 'Ramsay AG', 'Gribben JG', 'Michie AM']","['Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow The Babraham Institute, Cambridge.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London.', ""Department of Haemato-Oncology, King's College London, UK."", 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London.', 'Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow Alison.Michie@glasgow.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['G0701354/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'G0601099/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K014854/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150123,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase C beta/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4380723,,2015/01/27 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,['2015/01/25 06:00'],"['2015/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.112276 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.112276 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Apr;100(4):499-510. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.112276.

The aim of this study is to analyze the cytotoxic effects of curine in cancer cell lines HL-60, K562, and HT-29, and in primary cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Cells were treated with curine (from 3 to 15 microM) for 24 and 48 h. Cell viability was analyzed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test and flow cytometry with propidium iodide (PI) assay. To assess the type of cell death induced in HL-60, the cell cycle, morphological, and biochemical alterations were analyzed, which were determined by differential staining with acridine orange/ethidium bromide, and annexin V/PI double-labeling and change in mitochondrial membrane potential assays. Curine demonstrated a potent cytotoxic effect on leukemic cell lines (HL-60 and K562). Its cytotoxic effects in HL-60 cells was related to plasma membrane damage and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase from 43.4 +/- 1.0 to 56.7 +/- 1.4 % (p < 0.05). Curine (15 muM) also increased the apoptotic cells number by around 60 % in HL-60 cells and caused phosphatidylserine externalization, inducing about 57 % of apoptosis. Moreover, this alkaloid provoked 20 % of mitochondrial membrane depolarization. We conclude that curine presented a cytotoxic effect and induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Thus, it can be considered a promising pharmacological drug.","['Dantas, Bruna Braga', 'Faheina-Martins, Glaucia Verissimo', 'Coulidiati, Tangbadioa Herve', 'Bomfim, Caio Cesar Barbosa', 'da Silva Dias, Celidarque', 'Barbosa-Filho, Jose Maria', 'Araujo, Demetrius Antonio Machado']","['Dantas BB', 'Faheina-Martins GV', 'Coulidiati TH', 'Bomfim CC', 'da Silva Dias C', 'Barbosa-Filho JM', 'Araujo DA']","['Department of Biotechnology, Center of Biotechnology, Federal University of Paraiba, Cidade Universitaria, Campus I, 58051-900, Joao Pessoa, PB, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150124,Japan,J Nat Med,Journal of natural medicines,101518405,IM,"['Annexin A5', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/isolation & purification/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Menispermaceae/*chemistry', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,2015/01/27 06:00,2015/06/03 06:00,['2015/01/25 06:00'],"['2014/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11418-014-0881-5 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Med. 2015 Apr;69(2):218-23. doi: 10.1007/s11418-014-0881-5.

Specifically, patients with DS have a reported 10-20-fold increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Anthracycline-based treatment regimens achieve good results in patients with DS and AML. It has been proposed that DS status constitutes a risk factor for the cardiotoxicity associated with the use of anthracyclines in the pediatric setting. However, published evidence pointing toward an increased risk of cardiotoxicity in patients with DS is relatively scarce and conflictive. This concise review compiles literature relating to the incidence of anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity in pediatric patients with DS. In general, reports from trials using anthracyclines at the maximum recommended dose showed increases in the incidence of anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity in patients with DS in comparison with trials that used anthracyclines at reduced doses. Evidence from the literature suggests that patients with DS can achieve favorable therapeutic outcomes after receiving treatment with reduced doses of anthracyclines to minimize the potential for cardiotoxicity. Further prospective trials, along with the available evidence, would assist the design of treatment protocols for patients with pediatric leukemias and DS.","['Hefti, Erik', 'Blanco, Javier G']","['Hefti E', 'Blanco JG']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, The State University of New York at Buffalo, 470 Kapoor Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14214, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, The State University of New York at Buffalo, 470 Kapoor Hall, Buffalo, NY, 14214, USA. jgblanco@buffalo.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM073646/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 HD076055/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM073646/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03HD076055/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Cardiovasc Toxicol,Cardiovascular toxicology,101135818,IM,"['Anthracyclines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy']",PMC4514565,['NIHMS658262'],2015/01/27 06:00,2016/10/01 06:00,['2015/01/25 06:00'],"['2015/01/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12012-015-9307-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12012-015-9307-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Toxicol. 2016 Jan;16(1):5-13. doi: 10.1007/s12012-015-9307-1.,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Anthracycline', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Down syndrome', 'Doxorubicin', 'Leukemia', 'Pediatric']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 1 420 children (0-14 years old) with an initial diagnosis of non-severe aplastic anemia between January 1990 and June 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Bone marrow cell morphology and histopathology were re-evaluated, and the patients were re-classified using the criteria proposed in the 2008 edition of the World Health Organization classification of RCC in hematopoietic and lymphoid tumor tissues. The clinical outcomes were followed up every 3-6 months. RESULTS: Among all the 1 420 cases, 152 (10.7%) were reassessed as RCC. Patients with RCC had a lower level of hemoglobin and a higher percentage of fetal hemoglobin than those with non-severe aplastic anemia. Of the patients with RCC, 21.5% showed abnormal karyotypes at diagnosis. The median follow-up period for all patients was 36 months (ranging from 1 to 283 months). The rates of complete response, partial response, and no response to cyclosporine and androgen treatment in RCC patients were 19.0%, 26.7%, and 54.3%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year prospective overall survival rates of RCC patients were 87.9% and 72.4%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year prospective clonal evolution rates were 15.3% and 20.0%, respectively.

METHODS: The clinical data of 14 children who were diagnosed with JMML and were examined for the detection of common gene mutations were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Eleven (79%) out of 14 cases were male, and 3 (21%) were female. The median age at diagnosis was 2.0 years (age range: 0.6-6.0 years). Among 14 cases, there were 4 cases (29%) with PTPN11 mutation, 3 cases (21%) with N-RAS mutation, 1 case (7%) with PTPN11 mutation and K-RAS mutation, and 6 cases (43%) without any mutation. All four cases in the PTPN11 mutation group were male, and their median age was 2.5 years; interval from onset to diagnosis was 1.0 month; the white blood cell (WBC) count and absolute monocytes in peripheral blood were significantly higher, while the platelet (PLT) count was lower, as compared with the other three groups; they were followed up, and 3 cases died and 1 case had a progressive disease.

CONCLUSIONS: PTPN11 mutation is the most common mutation in JMML. The cases with PTPN11 mutation often have higher WBC count and absolute monocytes in peripheral blood, a lower PLT count, and a rapid disease progression, and their clinical outcomes are poor. The cases with N-RAS mutation have a slow disease progression.

Sample preparation involved protein precipitation with methanol. The analysis was carried out on an Agilent C8 column (3.5 microm, 2.1 x 50 mm). Elution was achieved with a mobile phase gradient varying the proportion of a water solution containing 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and a 0.1% formic acid in methanol solution (solvent B) at a flow rate of 300 muL/min. The method had a linear calibration curve over the concentration range of 2-1000 ng/mL for ME and 2-1000 ng/mL for PI. The lower limits of quantification of ME and PI were 2 and 2 ng/mL, respectively. The intra- and inter-day precision values were <15% and accuracy values were within +/-10.0%.

Current biochemical methods are not very efficient in identifying and differentiating large-scale prenylations in vivo or in vitro. There are limited methods available for large-scale detection of prenylated proteins using mass spectrometry and no methods currently available which can distinguish farnesylation and geranylgeranylation modification in a single experimental setup. In this study, a simple and novel method for detection and distinction of large-scale prenylated peptides using mass spectrometry-cleavable approaches was developed. The method utilizes simple chemistry on the prenyl group and cleavable properties of a sulfoxide group in the gas phase to produce a signature mass spectrum during tandem mass spectrometric events. The characteristic masses lost from the modified prenylated peptides distinguished the types of prenylation. We also introduced epoxy groups in the prenylation sites of the proteins to make them more hydrophilic and enrichable from complex samples. Stability of the epoxide group was also studied under liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) conditions. The proof-of-concept of this method was established using prenylated peptides which mimicked the prenyl motifs in the proteins. We believe this method will advance the identification and differentiation of the types of prenylation in proteins in large-scale studies and will improve significantly our knowledge of the mechanism of cancer, cancer treatments, and diagnosis.","['Bhawal, Ruchika P', 'Sadananda, Sandhya C', 'Bugarin, Alejandro', 'Laposa, Brian', 'Chowdhury, Saiful M']","['Bhawal RP', 'Sadananda SC', 'Bugarin A', 'Laposa B', 'Chowdhury SM']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Texas at Arlington , Arlington, Texas 76019-0065, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150205,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,IM,"['Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Peptides/*analysis/chemical synthesis/*chemistry']",,,2015/01/24 06:00,2015/11/10 06:00,['2015/01/24 06:00'],"['2015/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ac503794s [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2015 Feb 17;87(4):2178-86. doi: 10.1021/ac503794s.

There have been no previous studies focusing on the effects of exchange transfusion (ExT) on WBC count, respiratory status, and other parameters in TL patients with hyperleukocytosis. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was carried out at a single center of all five DS neonates with TL, GATA1 mutations, and hyperleukocytosis, born at a median gestational age of 34 weeks (range, 30-38 weeks) with birthweight 2556 g (range, 1756-3268 g) during a 24 month study period between September 2011 and August 2013. All five neonates underwent ExT at a median age of 2 days (range, 0-5 days) before initiation of other cytoreductive therapy with cytarabine, which was carried out in two patients. RESULTS: All patients required respiratory support before ExT. After ExT, respiration status improved in all five patients: WBC count (mean) decreased by 85% from 143 x 10(9) /L to 21 x 10(9) /L. None developed tumor lysis syndrome. Three survived and two died: one hydrops fetalis neonate born at gestational week 30 died at age 5 days, and another died eventually from acute gastroenteritis 40 days after leaving hospital at the age of 155 days with complete remission. Two of the three surviving neonates developed acute megakaryocytic leukemia at age 90 days and 222 days. CONCLUSION: ExT was very effective in improving hyperleukocytosis and may have had favorable effects on respiration.","['Hayasaka, Itaru', 'Cho, Kazutoshi', 'Morioka, Keita', 'Kaneshi, Yosuke', 'Akimoto, Takuma', 'Furuse, Yuta', 'Moriichi, Akinori', 'Iguchi, Akihiro', 'Cho, Yuko', 'Minakami, Hisanori', 'Ariga, Tadashi']","['Hayasaka I', 'Cho K', 'Morioka K', 'Kaneshi Y', 'Akimoto T', 'Furuse Y', 'Moriichi A', 'Iguchi A', 'Cho Y', 'Minakami H', 'Ariga T']","['Maternity and Perinatal Care Center, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Maternity and Perinatal Care Center, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Maternity and Perinatal Care Center, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Maternity and Perinatal Care Center, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Maternity and Perinatal Care Center, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Maternity and Perinatal Care Center, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Maternity and Perinatal Care Center, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20150428,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,IM,"['Down Syndrome/*complications/therapy', 'Exchange Transfusion, Whole Blood/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemoid Reaction/complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,,2015/01/24 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ped.12586 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2015 Aug;57(4):620-5. doi: 10.1111/ped.12586.

TAL1 is amongst the most frequently deregulated oncogenes. Yet, over half of the TAL1(+) cases lack TAL1 lesions, suggesting unrecognized (epi)genetic deregulation mechanisms. Here we show that TAL1 is normally silenced in the T-cell lineage, and that the polycomb H3K27me3-repressive mark is focally diminished in TAL1(+) T-ALLs. Sequencing reveals that >20% of monoallelic TAL1(+) patients without previously known alterations display microinsertions or RAG1/2-mediated episomal reintegration in a single site 5' to TAL1. Using 'allelic-ChIP' and CrispR assays, we demonstrate that such insertions induce a selective switch from H3K27me3 to H3K27ac at the inserted but not the germline allele. We also show that, despite a considerable mechanistic diversity, the mode of oncogenic TAL1 activation, rather than expression levels, impact on clinical outcome. Altogether, these studies establish site-specific epigenetic desilencing as a mechanism of oncogenic activation.","['Navarro, Jean-Marc', 'Touzart, Aurore', 'Pradel, Lydie C', 'Loosveld, Marie',

Because up to 25% of SM patients have KITD816V-positive eosinophilia, we undertook whole-exome sequencing in a patient with aggressive SM with eosinophilia to identify novel genetic alterations. We conducted sequencing of purified eosinophils (clone/tumor sample), with T-lymphocytes as the matched control/non-tumor sample. In addition to KITD816V, we identified a somatic missense mutation in ethanolamine kinase 1 (ETNK1N244S) that was not present in 50 healthy controls. Targeted resequencing of 290 patients showed ETNK1 mutations to be distributed as follows: (i) SM (n=82; 6% mutated); (ii) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; n=29; 14% mutated); (iii) idiopathic hypereosinophilia (n=137; <1% mutated); (iv) primary myelofibrosis (n=32; 0% mutated); and (v) others (n=10; 0% mutated). Of the 82 SM cases, 25 had significant eosinophilia; of these 20% carried ETNK1 mutations. The ten mutations (N244S=6, N244T=1, N244K=1, G245A=2) targeted two contiguous amino acids in the ETNK1 kinase domain, and are predicted to be functionally disruptive. In summary, we identified novel somatic missense ETNK1 mutations that were most frequent in SM with eosinophilia and CMML; this suggests a potential pathogenetic role for dysregulated cytidine diphosphate-ethanolamine pathway metabolites in these diseases.","['Lasho, T L', 'Finke, C M', 'Zblewski, D', 'Patnaik, M', 'Ketterling, R P', 'Chen, D', 'Hanson, C A', 'Tefferi, A', 'Pardanani, A']","['Lasho TL', 'Finke CM', 'Zblewski D', 'Patnaik M', 'Ketterling RP', 'Chen D', 'Hanson CA', 'Tefferi A', 'Pardanani A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Cytogenetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150123,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Eosinophilia/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Exome/genetics', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*genetics']",PMC4314457,,2015/01/24 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2015/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201494 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2014.94 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2015 Jan 23;5:e275. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2014.94.,"['EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.82 (ethanolamine kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of autophagy in vitro or in vivo by rapamycin or starvation downregulated oncogenic fusion protein E2A/Pbx1. Furthermore, E2A/Pbx1 was found to be colocalized with autophagy marker LC3 in autolysosomes and with ubiquitin in response to autophagy stimuli, whereas autophagy or ubiquitination inhibitor blocked these colocalizations. Together, our data suggest a collaborative action between autophagy and ubiquitination in the degradation of E2A/Pbx1, thereby revealing a novel strategy for targeted preventive or treatment therapy

However, MRD assessment does not guide routine clinical management and its assessment remains complex. We incorporated detection of the B cell, tumor-specific antigen CD160 to develop a single-tube, flow cytometry assay (CD160FCA) for CLL MRD to a threshold of 10(-4) to 10(-5). One hundred and eighty-seven patients treated for CLL were enrolled. Utilizing the CD160FCA methodology, there was a high level of comparison between blood and bone marrow (R=0.87, P<0.001). In a validation cohort, CD160FCA and the international standardised approach of the European Research Initiative on CLL group demonstrated high concordance (R=0.91, P<0.01). Patients in complete remission (CR) and CD160FCA negative had longer event-free survival (EFS) (63 vs 16 months, P<0.01) and prolonged time to next treatment (60 vs 15 months, P<0.001) vs MRD positive patients; with a median time to MRD positivity of 36 months. In multivariate analysis, CD160FCA MRD detection was independently predictive of EFS in patients in CR and even predicted EFS in the good-risk cytogenetic subgroup. CD160FCA offers a simple assay for MRD detection in CLL and gives prognostic information across different CLL risk groups.","['Farren, T W', 'Giustiniani, J', 'Fanous, M', 'Liu, F', 'Macey, M G', 'Wright, F', 'Prentice, A', 'Nathwani, A', 'Agrawal, S G']","['Farren TW', 'Giustiniani J', 'Fanous M', 'Liu F', 'Macey MG', 'Wright F', 'Prentice A', 'Nathwani A', 'Agrawal SG']","['1] Department of Haemato-Oncology and Immunophenotyping Section, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK [2] Pathology Group, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Laboratoire de Therapie Cellulaire, Institut Jean Godinot, 1 Avenue du General Koenig, Reims, France.', 'Pathology Group, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Pathology Group, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Department of Haemato-Oncology and Immunophenotyping Section, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, The Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, The Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', '1] Department of Haemato-Oncology and Immunophenotyping Section, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK [2] Pathology Group, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.']",['eng'],['RP-PG-0310-1001/Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150123,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/chemically induced/*diagnosis/pathology', '*Prognosis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics']",PMC4314455,,2015/01/24 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2015/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201492 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2014.92 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2015 Jan 23;5:e273. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2014.92.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD160 protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Testing for various mutations in the BCR-ABL gene may help predict lack of response to specific TKIs where resistance has developed. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the emergence of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations associated with newly diagnosed CML patients exposed to first-line TKI treatment. METHODS: Published studies were identified using a structured search of online databases. Original research studies were included if they reported the incidence of specific BCR-ABL kinase domain point mutations after first-line TKI treatment failure or baseline mutations for second-line TKI treatment following first-line treatment failure. Meta-analysis of mutation rates across studies was based on DerSimonian and Laird's random-effects model. RESULTS: Of 1,323 citations, 12 studies met the inclusion criteria, involving a total of 1,698 patients. Overall mutation rates (95% CI) were imatinib 9.7% (6.2%-13.3%); dasatanib 1.7% (0.0%-4.3%); and nilotinib 3.3% (0.0%-7.7%). The most common specific mutations were T315I, E255K, and M351T. T315I mutations constituted 58% (7 of 12) of dasatinib-related mutations and 13% (15 of 117) of imatinib-related mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of response to TKIs associated with mutation in the BCR-ABL gene was significantly higher in imatinib-treated patients, and all mutations arose after treatment. T315I was a common treatment-emergent mutation. Further research is needed to assess the prognostic value of testing for mutations and the economic implications of treatment-emergent mutations.","['Ursan, Iulia D', 'Jiang, Ruixuan', 'Pickard, Evan M', 'Lee, Todd A', 'Ng, Daniel', 'Pickard, A Simon']","['Ursan ID', 'Jiang R', 'Pickard EM', 'Lee TA', 'Ng D', 'Pickard AS']","['University of Illinois College of Pharmacy, 833 S.

Recent attempts to identify the leukemia stem-like cells (LSC) have also indicated heterogeneity of these cells. On the basis of mathematical modeling and computer simulations, we have provided evidence that proliferation and self-renewal rates of the LSC population have greater impact on the course of disease than proliferation and self-renewal rates of leukemia blast populations, that is, leukemia progenitor cells. The modeling approach has enabled us to estimate the LSC properties of 31 individuals with relapsed AML and to link them to patient survival. On the basis of the estimated LSC properties, the patients can be divided into two prognostic groups that differ significantly with respect to overall survival after first relapse. The results suggest that high LSC self-renewal and proliferation rates are indicators of poor prognosis. Nevertheless, high LSC self-renewal rate may partially compensate for slow LSC proliferation and vice versa. Thus, model-based interpretation of clinical data allows estimation of prognostic factors that cannot be measured directly. This may have clinical implications for designing treatment strategies.","['Stiehl, Thomas', 'Baran, Natalia', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Marciniak-Czochra, Anna']","['Stiehl T', 'Baran N', 'Ho AD', 'Marciniak-Czochra A']","['Institute of Applied Mathematics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

Importantly, by taking advantage of this new platform, we demonstrate the key role of an aberrant LRF-DLK1-SOX9 pathway in the pathogenesis of undifferentiated sarcoma, with important therapeutic implications. SIGNIFICANCE: The paucity of therapeutic options for the treatment of sarcoma calls for a rapid and effective preclinical assessment of new therapeutic modalities.

METHODS: The developed PBPK model was extended for 6-mercaptopurine to account for intracellular metabolism and genetic polymorphism in TPMT activity. System and drug specific parameters were obtained from the literature or estimated using plasma or intracellular red blood cell concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine and its metabolites. Age-dependent changes in parameters were implemented for scaling, and variability was also introduced for simulation. The model was validated using published data. RESULTS: The model was extended successfully. Parameter estimation and model predictions were satisfactory. Prediction of intracellular red blood cell concentrations of 6-thioguanine nucleotide for different TPMT phenotypes (in a clinical study that compared conventional and individualized dosing) showed results that were consistent with observed values and reported incidence of haematopoietic toxicity. Following conventional dosing, the predicted mean concentrations for homozygous and heterozygous variants, respectively, were about 10 times and two times the levels for wild-type. However, following individualized dosing, the mean concentration was around the same level for the three phenotypes despite different doses. CONCLUSIONS: The developed PBPK model has been extended for 6-mercaptopurine and can be used to predict plasma 6-mercaptopurine and tissue concentration of 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine nucleotide and 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleotide in adults and children. Predictions of reported data from clinical studies showed satisfactory results. The model may help to improve 6-mercaptopurine dosing, achieve better clinical outcome and reduce toxicity.","['Ogungbenro, Kayode', 'Aarons, Leon']","['Ogungbenro K', 'Aarons L']","['Centre for Applied Pharmacokinetics Research, Manchester Pharmacy School, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PT, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Applied Pharmacokinetics Research, Manchester Pharmacy School, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PT, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['MC_G1100157/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20150601,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', '*Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', '*Models, Biological', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Young Adult']",PMC4500328,,2015/01/24 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2015/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bcp.12588 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2015 Jul;80(1):86-100. doi: 10.1111/bcp.12588.

HTLV-1 oncoproteins, Tax and HBZ, play crucial roles in the immortalization of T-cells and/or leukemogenesis by dysregulating the cellular functions in the host. Recent studies show that HTLV-1-infected T-cells have reduced expression of the BCL11B tumor suppressor protein. In the present study, we explored whether Tax and/or HBZ play a role in downregulating BCL11B in HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Lentiviral transduction of Tax in a human T-cell line repressed the expression of BCL11B at both the protein and mRNA levels, whereas the transduction of HBZ had little effect on the expression. Tax mutants with a decreased activity for the NF-kappaB, CREB or PDZ protein pathways still showed a reduced expression of the BCL11B protein, thereby implicating a different function of Tax in BCL11B downregulation. In addition, the HTLV-2 Tax2 protein reduced the BCL11B protein expression in T-cells. Seven HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, including three ATL-derived cell lines, showed reduced BCL11B mRNA and protein expression relative to an uninfected T-cell line, and the greatest reductions were in the cells expressing Tax. Collectively, these results indicate that Tax is responsible for suppressing BCL11B protein expression in HTLV-1-infected T-cells; Tax-mediated repression of BCL11B is another mechanism that Tax uses to promote oncogenesis of HTLV-1-infected T-cells.","['Takachi, Takayuki', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Takahashi-Yoshita, Manami', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Obata, Miki', 'Mishima, Yukio', 'Okuda, Shujiro', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Matsuoka, Masao', 'Saitoh, Akihiko', 'Green, Patrick L', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Takachi T', 'Takahashi M', 'Takahashi-Yoshita M', 'Higuchi M', 'Obata M', 'Mishima Y', 'Okuda S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Matsuoka M', 'Saitoh A', 'Green PL', 'Fujii M']","['Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan; Division of Pediatrics, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150316,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*virology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4409891,['NIHMS699761'],2015/01/24 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2015/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/07 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12618 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2015 Apr;106(4):461-5. doi: 10.1111/cas.12618.

It is currently possible to select a therapeutic strategy for ATL and predict prognosis by classification of patients by clinical subtypes and clinicopathological factors. Although the overall survival (OS) of patients with ATL has increased marginally because of advances in chemotherapy, further prolongation of survival might be difficult with conventional chemotherapy alone. Promising results have been reported for antiviral therapy using zidovudine and interferon-alpha, and, indeed, antiviral therapy is currently the standard treatment for patients with ATL in western countries. Remarkably, the 5-year OS rates are 100% for both the smoldering-type and chronic-type ATL. Recently, treatments for ATL have included allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and molecular targeted therapies. Furthermore, the anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody mogamulizumab has been shown to have marked cytotoxic effects on ATL cells, especially in the leukemic type of ATL. In the lymphoma type of ATL, the response rate may be improved by combining mogamulizumab with chemotherapy. It should be recognized that prevention of infection from carriers of human T-cell leukemia virus type-I and transfer of the virus from mother to infant are crucial issues for the eradication of ATL.","['Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Choi, Ilseung', 'Chihara, Dai', 'Seto, Masao']","['Utsunomiya A', 'Choi I', 'Chihara D', 'Seto M']","['Department of Hematology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150306,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/*methods', 'HTLV-I Infections/drug therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Receptors, CCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Zidovudine/therapeutic use']",PMC4409876,,2015/01/24 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2015/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12617 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2015 Apr;106(4):344-51. doi: 10.1111/cas.12617.

NF-kappaB has been proven to promote cancer cell survival, and targeting this pathway will halt the growth of cancer cells. Efforts have been made to produce semisynthetic derivatives of andrographolide with improved anticancer potency and selectivity. Subsequently, the effect of a selected derivative, 3,14,19-tripropionylandrographolide (SRS06), was tested for its action against NF-kappaB. METHODS: Screening against 60 US National Cancer Institute (NCI) human cancer cell lines representing leukemia and non-small cell lung (NSCL), colon, CNS, melanoma, ovarian, renal, prostate, and breast cancers was performed to determine the tumor type selectivity and potency of SRS06. Microculture tetrazolium, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide and sulforhodamine B assays were used to determine the in vitro anticancer activity, while Western blot studies were performed to ascertain the inhibitory effect of SRS06 on the NF-kappaB signaling cascade. The TransAM p65 assay kit was used to determine NF-kappaB p65 DNA binding activity in the NSCL cancer cell line A549. RESULTS: From the NCI screening, SRS06 was found to exhibit potent growth-inhibitory effects on multiple cancer cell lines with 10-fold lower 50% growth inhibition (GI50) compared with andrographolide. It was also discerned that the compound preferentially targeted melanoma, CNS, renal, colon, ovarian, prostate, and NSCL cancer cell lines. The DNA fragmentation assay indicated that the main mode of cell death of SRS06-treated A549 cells was via apoptosis. At 5 micromol/l the compound decreased NF-kappaB protein expression and caused a significant reduction in the nuclear p65 DNA binding activity. CONCLUSION: SRS06 displayed improved anticancer selectivity and potency when compared with andrographolide. We alluded its anticancer activity to its effect of inhibiting NF-kappaB nuclear binding.","['Lim, Jonathan Chee Woei', 'Jeyaraj, Ethel Jeyaseela', 'Sagineedu, Sreenivasa Rao', 'Wong, Wai Shiu Fred', 'Stanslas, Johnson']","['Lim JC', 'Jeyaraj EJ', 'Sagineedu SR', 'Wong WS', 'Stanslas J']","['Pharmacotherapeutics Unit, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150123,Switzerland,Pharmacology,Pharmacology,0152016,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,2015/01/24 06:00,2015/10/07 06:00,['2015/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['000370313 [pii]', '10.1159/000370313 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacology. 2015;95(1-2):70-7. doi: 10.1159/000370313.

FeLV vaccines have been a global success story, reducing virus prevalence in countries where uptake is high. In contrast, the more recent FIV vaccine was introduced in 2002 and the degree of protection afforded in the field remains to be established. However, given the similarities between FIV and HIV, field studies of FIV vaccine efficacy are likely to advise and inform the development of future approaches to HIV vaccination. Here we assessed the neutralising antibody response induced by FIV vaccination against a panel of FIV isolates, by testing blood samples collected from client-owned vaccinated Australian cats. We examined the molecular and phenotypic properties of 24 envs isolated from one vaccinated cat that we speculated might have become infected following natural exposure to FIV. Cats vaccinated against FIV did not display broadly neutralising antibodies, suggesting that protection may not extend to some virulent recombinant strains of FIV circulating in Australia.","['Beczkowski, Pawel M', 'Harris, Matthew', 'Techakriengkrai, Navapon', 'Beatty, Julia A', 'Willett, Brian J', 'Hosie, Margaret J']","['Beczkowski PM', 'Harris M', 'Techakriengkrai N', 'Beatty JA', 'Willett BJ', 'Hosie MJ']","['Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom; Small Animal Hospital, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.

METHODS: Between 2008-2013, 10,106 subjects aged 20-85 were enrolled in 23 hospitals and primary care centres in 12 Spanish provinces including 1,112 cases with a new diagnosis of prostate cancer, 1,738 of breast cancer, 2,140 of colorectal cancer, 459 of gastro-oesophageal cancer, 559 cases with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and 4,098 population controls frequency matched to cases by age, sex and region of residence. Participation rates ranged from 57% (stomach cancer) to 87% (CLL cases) and from 30% to 77% in controls. Participants completed a face-to-face computerized interview on sociodemographic factors, environmental exposures, occupation, medication, lifestyle, and personal and family medical history. In addition, participants completed a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire and telephone interviews. Blood samples were collected from 76% of participants while saliva samples were collected in CLL cases and participants refusing blood extractions. Clinical information was recorded for cases and paraffin blocks and/or fresh tumor samples are available in most collaborating hospitals. Genotyping was done through an exome array enriched with genetic markers in specific pathways. Multiple analyses are planned to assess the association of environmental, personal and genetic risk factors for each tumor and to identify pleiotropic effects. DISCUSSION: This study, conducted within the Spanish Consortium for Biomedical Research in Epidemiology & Public Health (CIBERESP), is a unique initiative to evaluate etiological factors for common cancers and will promote cancer research and prevention in Spain.","['Castano-Vinyals, Gemma', 'Aragones, Nuria', 'Perez-Gomez, Beatriz', 'Martin, Vicente', 'Llorca, Javier', 'Moreno, Victor', 'Altzibar, Jone M', 'Ardanaz, Eva', 'de Sanjose, Silvia', 'Jimenez-Moleon, Jose Juan', 'Tardon, Adonina', 'Alguacil, Juan', 'Peiro, Rosana', 'Marcos-Gragera, Rafael', 'Navarro, Carmen', 'Pollan, Marina', 'Kogevinas, Manolis']","['Castano-Vinyals G', 'Aragones N', 'Perez-Gomez B', 'Martin V', 'Llorca J', 'Moreno V', 'Altzibar JM', 'Ardanaz E', 'de Sanjose S', 'Jimenez-Moleon JJ', 'Tardon A', 'Alguacil J', 'Peiro R', 'Marcos-Gragera R', 'Navarro C', 'Pollan M', 'Kogevinas M']","['Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology (CREAL), Barcelona, Spain; IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute), Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), Barcelona, Spain; CIBER Epidemiologia y Salud Publica (CIBERESP), Madrid, Spain.

In an effort to identify more potent and well-tolerated agents for myeloma, we have previously reported that 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA), a natural condiment from South-East Asia, induces apoptotic cell death of myeloma cells in vitro and in vivo through inhibition of NF-kappaB-related functions. Searching for more potent NF-kappaB inhibitors, we developed several ACA analogs based on quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis. TM-233, one of these ACA analogs, inhibited cellular proliferation and induced cell death in various myeloma cell lines with a lower IC50 than ACA. Treatment with TM-233 inhibited constitutive activation of JAK2 and STAT3, and then downregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein, but not Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. In addition, TM-233 rapidly decreased the nuclear expression of NF-kappaB and also decreased the accumulation of cytosolic NF-kappaB. We also examined the effects of TM-233 on bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells that we recently established, KMS-11/BTZ and OPM-2/BTZ. TM-233, but not bortezomib, inhibited cellular proliferation and induced cell death in KMS-11/BTZ and OPM-2/BTZ cells. Interestingly, the combination of TM-233 and bortezomib significantly induced cell death in these bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells through inhibition of NF-kappaB activity. These results indicate that TM-233 could overcome bortezomib resistance in myeloma cells mediated through different mechanisms, possibly inhibiting the JAK/STAT pathway. In conclusion, TM-233 might be a more potent NF-kappaB inhibitor than ACA, and could overcome bortezomib resistance in myeloma cells.","['Sagawa, Morihiko', 'Tabayashi, Takayuki', 'Kimura, Yuta', 'Tomikawa, Tatsuki', 'Nemoto-Anan, Tomoe', 'Watanabe, Reiko', 'Tokuhira, Michihide', 'Ri, Masaki', 'Hashimoto, Yuichi', 'Iida, Shinsuke', 'Kizaki, Masahiro']","['Sagawa M', 'Tabayashi T', 'Kimura Y', 'Tomikawa T', 'Nemoto-Anan T', 'Watanabe R', 'Tokuhira M', 'Ri M', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Iida S', 'Kizaki M']","['Department of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Kawagoe, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150310,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzyl Alcohols/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Multiple Myeloma/*enzymology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis']",PMC4409888,,2015/01/24 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2015/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12616 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2015 Apr;106(4):438-46. doi: 10.1111/cas.12616.

We demonstrate that the Rap signal is required for the proliferation and leukemogenesis of established Notch-dependent T-ALL cell lines. Attenuation of the Rap signal by the expression of a dominant-negative Rap1A17 or Rap1GAP, Sipa1, in a T-ALL cell line resulted in the reduced Notch processing at site 2 due to impaired maturation of Adam10. Inhibition of the Rap1 prenylation with a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor abrogated its membrane-anchoring to Golgi-network and caused reduced proprotein convertase activity required for Adam10 maturation. Exogenous expression of a mature form of Adam10 overcame the Sipa1-induced inhibition of T-ALL cell proliferation. T-ALL cell lines expressed Notch ligands in a Notch-signal dependent manner, which contributed to the cell-autonomous Notch activation. Although the initial thymic blast cells barely expressed Notch ligands during the T-ALL development from Rap(high) hematopoietic progenitors in vivo, the ligands were clearly expressed in the T-ALL cells invading extrathymic vital organs. These results reveal a crucial role of the Rap signal in the Notch-dependent T-ALL development and the progression.","['Doi, Keiko', 'Imai, Takahiko', 'Kressler, Christopher', 'Yagita, Hideo', 'Agata, Yasutoshi', 'Vooijs, Marc', 'Hamazaki, Yoko', 'Inoue, Joe', 'Minato, Nagahiro']","['Doi K', 'Imai T', 'Kressler C', 'Yagita H', 'Agata Y', 'Vooijs M', 'Hamazaki Y', 'Inoue J', 'Minato N']","['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Maastricht Radiation Oncology and School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, University of Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150123,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Notch/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4303867,,2015/01/24 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['srep07978 [pii]', '10.1038/srep07978 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Jan 23;5:7978. doi: 10.1038/srep07978.,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Rap1GAP protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Sipa1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We herein developed a novel therapeutic vaccine designed to augment an HTLV-I Tax-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response that has been implicated in anti-ATL effects, and conducted a pilot study to investigate its safety and efficacy. Three previously treated ATL patients, classified as intermediate- to high-risk, were subcutaneously administered with the vaccine, consisting of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with Tax peptides corresponding to the CTL epitopes. In all patients, the performance status improved after vaccination without severe adverse events, and Tax-specific CTL responses were observed with peaks at 16-20 weeks. Two patients achieved partial remission in the first 8 weeks, one of whom later achieved complete remission, maintaining their remission status without any additional chemotherapy 24 and 19 months after vaccination, respectively. The third patient, whose tumour cells lacked the ability to express Tax at biopsy, obtained stable disease in the first 8 weeks and later developed slowly progressive disease although additional therapy was not required for 14 months.

However, also non-CBF-AML frequently displays upregulated KIT expression. In the first part of this study we show that KIT expression can be also upregulated by miR-17, a regulator of RUNX1, the gene encoding a CBF subunit. Interestingly, both CBF leukemia fusion proteins and miR-17, which targets RUNX1-3'UTR, negatively affect a common core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism that forces myeloid cells into an undifferentiated, KIT-induced, proliferating state. In the second part of this study we took advantage of the conservation of the core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism in mouse and human, to mechanistically demonstrate in a mouse myeloid cell model that increased KIT-induced proliferation is per se a mechanism sufficient to delay myeloid differentiation. METHODS: Human (U937) or mouse (32D) myeloid clonal lines were used, respectively, to test: 1) the effect of RUNX1-MTG8 and CBFB-MYH11 fusion proteins, or upregulation of miR-17, on KIT-induced proliferation and myeloid differentiation, and 2) the effect of upregulation of KIT-induced proliferation per se on myeloid cell differentiation. RESULTS: In the first part of this study we found that stable miR-17 upregulation affects, like the CBF-AML fusion proteins (RUNX1-MTG8 or CBFB-MYH11), a core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism leading to KIT-induced proliferation of differentiation-arrested U937 myeloid cells. In the second part of the study we harnessed the conservation of this core mechanism in human and mouse to demonstrate that the extent of KIT upregulation in 32D mouse myeloid cells with wild type RUNX1 can per se delay G-CSF-induced differentiation. The integrated information gathered from the two myeloid cell models shows that RUNX1 regulates myeloid differentiation not only by direct transcriptional regulation of coding and non-coding myeloid differentiation functions (e.g. miR-223), but also by modulating KIT-induced proliferation via non-coding miRNAs (e.g. miR-221). CONCLUSIONS: The novelty of this study is dual. On the one hand, miRNAs (e.g. miR-17) can mimic the effects of CBF-AML fusion proteins by affecting a core RUNX1-miRNA mechanism of KIT-induced proliferation of undifferentiated myeloid cells. On the other hand, the extent of KIT-induced proliferation itself can modulate myeloid differentiation of cells with wild type RUNX1 function.","['Fischer, John', 'Rossetti, Stefano', 'Datta, Arani', 'Eng, Kevin', 'Beghini, Alessandro', 'Sacchi, Nicoletta']","['Fischer J', 'Rossetti S', 'Datta A', 'Eng K', 'Beghini A', 'Sacchi N']",,['eng'],['P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150123,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Binding Factor/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA Interference', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC4351976,,2015/01/24 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2015/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['s12943-014-0283-z [pii]', '10.1186/s12943-014-0283-z [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2015 Jan 23;14:7. doi: 10.1186/s12943-014-0283-z.,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MIRN17 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the related molecular mechanism involved in the protection of oral cancer cells remains unclear. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we determined that HMGB1 released by oral cancer cells protected the cells against apoptosis caused by vincristine by upregulating the transcription of Mcl-1. RESULTS: Extracellular HMGB1 seems to be required for the autophagy-mediated inhibition of apoptosis because the effect of autophagy protection was abolished by HMGB1 knockdown. Vincristine treatment increased the expression of Mcl-1 mRNA, but decreased the Mcl-1 protein expression. HMGB1 expression inhibited blocked the Mcl-1 transcription increase and reduced Mcl-1 expression, demonstrate that HMGB1 is required for the upregulation of Mcl-1 transcriptional, and thereby maintaining Mcl-1 protein expression levels is required for the survival of oral cancer cells by vincristine. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, this study suggested that the HMGB1-mediated Mcl-1 transcription upregulation is a key mechanism by which autophagy protects oral cancer cells against vincristine-induced apoptosis.","['Hsieh, Ming-Ju', 'Hsieh, Yi-Hsien', 'Lin, Chiao-Wen', 'Chen, Mu-Kuan', 'Yang, Shun-Fa', 'Chiou, Hui-Ling']","['Hsieh MJ', 'Hsieh YH', 'Lin CW', 'Chen MK', 'Yang SF', 'Chiou HL']","['Changhua Christian Hospital, Cancer Research Center , Changhua 500, Taiwan , ROC.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150122,England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HMGB1 Protein/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",,,2015/01/24 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/24 06:00'],"['2015/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2014.998200 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2015 Apr;19(4):455-70. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2014.998200.

To elucidate the role of epigenetics in RUNX inactivation, we evaluated promoter DNA methylation of RUNX1, 2, and 3 in 23 leukaemia cell lines and samples from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) and myelodysplatic syndromes (MDS) patients. RUNX1 and RUNX2 gene promoters were mostly unmethylated in cell lines and clinical samples. Hypermethylation of RUNX3 was frequent among cell lines (74%) and highly variable among patient samples, with clear association to cytogenetic status. High frequency of RUNX3 hypermethylation (85% of the 20 studied cases) was found in AML patients with inv(16)(p13.1q22) compared to other AML subtypes (31% of the other 49 cases). RUNX3 hypermethylation was also frequent in ALL (100% of the six cases) but low in MDS (21%). In support of a functional role, hypermethylation of RUNX3 was correlated with low levels of protein, and treatment of cell lines with the DNA demethylating agent, decitabine, resulted in mRNA re-expression. Furthermore, relapse-free survival of non-inv(16)(p13.1q22) AML patients without RUNX3 methylation was significantly better (P = 0.016) than that of methylated cases.

However, its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern and prognostic role of APRIL in GC. METHODS: Expression of APRIL was assessed by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Prognostic role of APRIL expression was evaluated. We also discovered the effect of APRIL on chemo-resistance in GC cells and the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: APRIL mRNA levels were significantly increased in GC tissues compared with adjacent tissues and high expression levels of APRIL in tumor cells significantly correlated with poor overall survival in patients receiving cisplatin adjuvant treatment. Overexpression of APRIL in AGS cells significantly attenuated the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, silence of APRIL in SGC7901 cells enhanced cisplatin-induced tumor suppression. Our data further revealed that the canonical NF-kappaB pathway was involved in APRIL-mediated chemo-resistance. In addition, expression of APRIL was regulated by miR-145 in GC cells. CONCLUSION: APRIL is a novel clinical chemo-resistance biomarker for gastric cancer and might be a promising therapeutic target for GC patients.","['Zhi, Xiaofei', 'Tao, Jinqiu', 'Xiang, Guoliang', 'Cao, Hongyong', 'Liu, Zijun', 'Yang, Kunxing', 'Lv, Chengyu', 'Ni, Shaozhong']","['Zhi X', 'Tao J', 'Xiang G', 'Cao H', 'Liu Z', 'Yang K', 'Lv C', 'Ni S']","['Department of General Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150127,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2015/01/24 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2015/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['000369720 [pii]', '10.1159/000369720 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2015;35(2):571-85. doi: 10.1159/000369720.

Decreased CD20 expression on these tumour B cells could be responsible for the lack of response observed in some patients treated with rituximab. Despite the potential critical role of CD20 in the biology of B cell malignancies, the mechanisms controlling its expression are poorly understood. At the bone marrow level, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) may regulate and support the survival of malignant cells, such as B-CLL cells. In this study, we investigated whether MSC may regulate the CD20 expression on B-CLL. For this purpose, B cells from CLL patients were isolated and co-cultured on MSC. B-CLL cells were collected from B-CLL/MSC co-cultures and examined for their expression of CD20. We demonstrate decreased CD20 expression in B-CLL cells after 2 weeks of co-culture with MSC, under contact and non-contact conditions, which was associated with a decreased susceptibility to rituximab. Additionally, B cells co-cultured with MSCs show an increase in CD59 expression. Our findings strongly suggest that the interaction between B-CLL cells and MSC may play a major role in the resistance to rituximab-induced apoptosis of B-CLL cells.","['Marquez, Maria-Elena', 'Hernandez-Uzcategui, Octavio', 'Cornejo, Alejandro', 'Vargas, Paula', 'Da Costa, Osiris']","['Marquez ME', 'Hernandez-Uzcategui O', 'Cornejo A', 'Vargas P', 'Da Costa O']","['Unidad de Terapia Celular, Laboratorio de Patologia Celular y Molecular, Centro de Medicina Experimental, Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC), Caracas, Venezuela.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150122,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'CD59 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Communication', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Rituximab']",,,2015/01/24 06:00,2015/06/11 06:00,['2015/01/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13286 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Apr;169(2):211-8. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13286.

We demonstrate that (1) gammadelta T cells are the predominant T-cell population in patients during the first weeks after transplantation, being mainly, albeit not only, derived from cells infused with the graft and expanding in vivo; (2) central-memory cells predominated very early posttransplantation for both Vdelta1 and Vdelta2 subsets; (3) Vdelta1 cells are specifically expanded in patients experiencing cytomegalovirus reactivation and are more cytotoxic compared with those of children who did not experience reactivation; (4) these subsets display a cytotoxic phenotype and degranulate when challenged with primary acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia blasts; and (5) Vdelta2 cells are expanded in vitro after exposure to zoledronic acid (ZOL) and efficiently lyse primary lymphoid and myeloid blasts. This is the first detailed characterization of gammadelta T cells emerging in peripheral blood of children after CD19(+) B-cell and alphabeta(+) T-cell-depleted haplo-HSCT.

Cloning and sequence analysis identified a novel large fragment HDV deletion mutant containing only 69% of the standard genome. Reverse transcription-PCR assay revealed persistence of this mutant with variations of the wild-type-to-mutant ratios during the clinical course. Serum samples from 405 patients with chronic hepatitis B were then submitted for HDV RNA analysis. Of them, 20 (4.9%) were positive for HDV RNA and 5 HDV RNA large fragment deletions were identified in three patients, all under entecavir treatment. Two of them suffered from acute hepatitis exacerbations leading to liver failure while the third had repeated hepatitis flares. The peak bilirubin levels in these three patients were significantly higher than the others without large fragment deletions (P = 0.003). The deleted regions (527-702 bases) encompassed two ribozyme domains as well as part of the hepatitis D antigen (HDAg) reading frame.

Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) represent a promising alternative to the encapsulation of lipophilic drugs such as ATRA. This study aims to develop, characterize and evaluate the cytotoxicity of ATRA-TB-loaded NLC for cancer treatment. METHODS: The influence of in situ formation of an ion pairing between ATRA and a lipophilic amine (benethamine) on the characteristics of NLC (size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency) was evaluated. TB, a butyric acid donor, was used as a component of the lipid matrix. In vitro activity on cell viability and distribution of cell cycle phases were evaluated for MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, HL-60 and Jurkat cell lines. RESULTS: The presence of the amine significantly increased the encapsulation efficiency of ATRA in NLC. Inhibition of cell viability by TB-ATRA-loaded NLC was more pronounced than the free drug. Analysis of the distribution of cell cycle phases also showed increased activity for TB-ATRA-loaded NLC, with the clear effect of cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase transition. The presence of TB played an important role in the activity of the formulation. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings suggest that TB-ATRA-loaded NLC represents a promising alternative to intravenous administration of ATRA in cancer treatment.","['Silva, Elton Luiz', 'Carneiro, Guilherme', 'Caetano, Priscila Albuquerque', 'Goulart, Gisele', 'Ferreira Costa, Daniel', 'de Souza-Fagundes, Elaine Maria', 'Gomes, Dawidson Assis', 'Ferreira, Lucas Antonio Miranda']","['Silva EL', 'Carneiro G', 'Caetano PA', 'Goulart G', 'Ferreira Costa D', 'de Souza-Fagundes EM', 'Gomes DA', 'Ferreira LA']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Minas Gerais, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['R03 TW008709/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', '1R03TW008709/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry', 'Drug Combinations', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Nanostructures', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Triglycerides/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology']",PMC4634877,['NIHMS733600'],2015/01/23 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/14737140.2015.1000868 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2015 Feb;15(2):247-56. doi: 10.1586/14737140.2015.1000868.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S05LZ624MF (tributyrin)']",['NOTNLM'],"['all-trans retinoic acid', 'cancer', 'cytotoxicity.', 'histone deacetylase inhibitors', 'nanostructured lipid carriers', 'tributyrin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to their similar effector cytokine production, there is a strong parallel between the transcription factors that control the differentiation of T(H)1, T(H)2 and T(H)17 cells and ILC groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Here, we review the transcriptional circuit that specifies the development of a common ILC progenitor and its subsequent programming into distinct ILC groups. Notch, GATA-3 (GATA-binding protein 3), Nfil3 (nuclear factor interleukin-3) and Id2 (inhibitor of DNA-binding 2) are identified as early factors that suppress B- and T-cell potentials and are turned on in favour of ILC commitment. Natural killer cells, which are the cytotoxic ILCs, develop along a pathway distinct from the rest of the helper-like ILCs that are derived from a common progenitor to all helper-like ILCs (CHILPs). PLZF(-) (promyelocytic leukaemia zinc-finger) CHILPs give rise to lymphoid tissue inducer cells, while PLZF(+) CHILPs have multilineage potential and could give rise to ILCs 1, 2 and 3. Such lineage specificity is dictated by the controlled expression of T-bet (T-box expressed in T cells), RORalpha (retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor-alpha), RORgammat (retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor-gammat) and AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor). In addition to the type of transcription factors, the developmental stages at which these factors are expressed are crucial in specifying the fate of the ILCs.","['Lim, A W Y', 'McKenzie, A N J']","['Lim AW', 'McKenzie AN']","['Division of Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK.', 'Division of Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['100963/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_U105178805/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150122,England,Genes Immun,Genes and immunity,100953417,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC4409422,['EMS61582'],2015/01/23 06:00,2016/01/21 06:00,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2014/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['gene201483 [pii]', '10.1038/gene.2014.83 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Immun. 2015 Apr-May;16(3):177-86. doi: 10.1038/gene.2014.83.

CD180/RP105, a membrane-associated orphan receptor of the TLR family, induces normal B cell activation and proliferation and is expressed by approximately 60% of CLL samples. Half of these respond to ligation with anti-CD180 antibody by increased activation/phosphorylation of protein kinases associated with BCR signaling. Hence CLL cells expressing both CD180 and the BCR could receive signals via both receptors. Here we investigated cross-talk between BCR and CD180-mediated signaling on CLL cell survival and apoptosis. Our data indicate that ligation of CD180 on responsive CLL cells leads to activation of either prosurvival Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK)/phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT-mediated, or proapoptotic p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK)-mediated signaling pathways, while selective immunoglobulin M (sIgM) ligation predominantly engages the BTK/PI3K/AKT pathway. Furthermore, pretreatment of CLL cells with anti-CD180 redirects IgM-mediated signaling from the prosurvival BTK/PI3K/AKT toward the proapoptotic p38MAPK pathway. Thus preengaging CD180 could prevent further prosurvival signaling mediated via the BCR and, instead, induce CLL cell apoptosis, opening the door to therapeutic profiling and new strategies for the treatment of a substantial cohort of CLL patients.","['Porakishvili, Nino', 'Vispute, Ketki', 'Steele, Andrew J', 'Rajakaruna, Nadeeka', 'Kulikova, Nina', 'Tsertsvadze, Tamar', 'Nathwani, Amit', 'Damle, Rajendra N', 'Clark, Edward A', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Lydyard, Peter M']","['Porakishvili N', 'Vispute K', 'Steele AJ', 'Rajakaruna N', 'Kulikova N', 'Tsertsvadze T', 'Nathwani A', 'Damle RN', 'Clark EA', 'Rai KR', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Lydyard PM']","['Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom.', 'University of Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom.', 'Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University, Georgia.', 'Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University, Georgia.', 'UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York, United States of America.', 'University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York, United States of America.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York, United States of America.', 'Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA081554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RP-PG-0310-1001/Department of Health/United Kingdom']",['Journal Article'],20150114,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,,,PMC4461575,,2015/01/23 06:00,2015/01/23 06:01,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2014/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/23 06:01 [medline]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['molmed.2014.00256 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2014.00265 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2015 Apr;21(1):46-57. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2014.00265.

In the present study, the effect of ATRA (10(-7) mol/L) on in vitro proliferation and apoptosis of B cells was investigated in 24 CLL patients and 8 normal subjects. Our results showed that ATRA markedly enhanced CpG-mediated proliferation of normal B cells, but it slightly inhibited CpG-induced proliferation of CLL B cells [stimulation index (SI): 105.6 vs. 14.7, P = 0.0001]. Although addition of IL-21 counteracted the proliferative effect of ATRA in normal B cells, it significantly enhanced the growth of tumor B cells in presence of CpG and ATRA. This stimulatory effect was restricted to nonprogressive and unmutated patients compared to progressive and mutated groups, respectively. Our results suggest that ATRA acts differentially on normal and CLL B cells and might have therapeutic implication in patients with progressive disease.","['Ghalamfarsa, Ghasem', 'Jadidi-Niaragh, Farhad', 'Amiri, Mohammad Mehdi', 'Razavi, Seyed Mohsen', 'Saboor-Yaraghi, Ali Akbar', 'Shokri, Fazel']","['Ghalamfarsa G', 'Jadidi-Niaragh F', 'Amiri MM', 'Razavi SM', 'Saboor-Yaraghi AA', 'Shokri F']","['a Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran and Immunology Research Center, Medical School , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150122,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,,2015/01/23 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2015.989368 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2015;67(2):285-91. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2015.989368.

NALP1 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 1) is a member of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family of proteins that are key organization proteins in the inflammasome. It is reported that NALP1 plays a central role in cell apoptosis, pyroptosis, inflammatory reactions and autoimmune diseases. DAC (5-aza-2-deoxycytidine) is an antitumor drug useful to lung cancer, myelodysplastic disorders, myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, we examined the expression of NALP1 in human normal and cancerous colon tissues using tissue microarray, western blot and quantitative real-time PCR and we measured the expression of NALP1 in three kinds of colon cancer cell lines and animal models before and after treatment with DAC. Furthermore, we examined the treatment effects of DAC on colon cancer in our animal model. Our data indicate that NALP1 is expressed low in human colorectal tumoral tissues relative to paratumoral tissues and was associated with the survival and tumor metastasis of patients. The expression of NALP1 increased after treatment with DAC both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, DAC suppressed the growth of colon cancer and increased lifespan in mouse model. Therefore, we conclude that NALP1 is expressed low in colon cancer and associated with the survival and tumor metastasis of patients, and treatment with DAC can restore NALP1 levels to suppress the growth of colon cancer.","['Chen, C', 'Wang, B', 'Sun, J', 'Na, H', 'Chen, Z', 'Zhu, Z', 'Yan, L', 'Ren, S', 'Zuo, Y']","['Chen C', 'Wang B', 'Sun J', 'Na H', 'Chen Z', 'Zhu Z', 'Yan L', 'Ren S', 'Zuo Y']","['1] Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, China [2] Department of General Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116023, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116023, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116023, China.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116023, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116023, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116023, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116023, China.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150122,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'NLR Proteins', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",PMC4669739,,2015/01/23 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2014/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014532 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.532 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2015 Jan 22;6:e1602. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.532.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (NLR Proteins)', '0 (NLRP1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to its oncogenic activities and overexpression in a majority of human cancers, it is an interesting target for novel drug therapies. MYC binding to the E-box (5'-CACGTGT-3') sequence at gene promoters contributes to more than 4000 MYC-dependent transcripts. Owing to its importance in MYC regulation, we designed a novel sequence-specific DNA-binding pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamide, Myc-5, that recognizes the E-box consensus sequence. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the Myc-5 binding sequence appeared in 5'- MYC binding E-box sequences at the eIF4G1, CCND1, and CDK4 gene promoters. Furthermore, ChIP coupled with detection by quantitative PCR indicated that Myc-5 has the ability to inhibit MYC binding at the target gene promoters and thus cause downregulation at the mRNA level and protein expression of its target genes in human Burkitt's lymphoma model cell line, P493.6, carrying an inducible MYC repression system and the K562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia) cell line. Single i.v. injection of Myc-5 at 7.5 mg/kg dose caused significant tumor growth inhibition in a MYC-dependent tumor xenograft model without evidence of toxicity. We report here a compelling rationale for the identification of a PI polyamide that inhibits a part of E-box-mediated MYC downstream gene expression and is a model for showing that phenotype-associated MYC downstream gene targets consequently inhibit MYC-dependent tumor growth.","['Mishra, Rajeev', 'Watanabe, Takayoshi', 'Kimura, Makoto T', 'Koshikawa, Nobuko', 'Ikeda, Maki', 'Uekusa, Shota', 'Kawashima, Hiroyuki', 'Wang, Xiaofei', 'Igarashi, Jun', 'Choudhury, Diptiman', 'Grandori, Carla', 'Kemp, Christopher J', 'Ohira, Miki', 'Verma, Narendra K', 'Kobayashi, Yujin', 'Takeuchi, Jin', 'Koshinaga, Tsugumichi', 'Nemoto, Norimichi', 'Fukuda, Noboru', 'Soma, Masayoshi', 'Kusafuka, Takeshi', 'Fujiwara, Kyoko', 'Nagase, Hiroki']","['Mishra R', 'Watanabe T', 'Kimura MT', 'Koshikawa N', 'Ikeda M', 'Uekusa S', 'Kawashima H', 'Wang X', 'Igarashi J', 'Choudhury D', 'Grandori C', 'Kemp CJ', 'Ohira M', 'Verma NK', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Takeuchi J', 'Koshinaga T', 'Nemoto N', 'Fukuda N', 'Soma M', 'Kusafuka T', 'Fujiwara K', 'Nagase H']","['Division of Cancer Genetics, Department of Advanced Medical Science, Nihon University Research Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 ES012249/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA176303/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150303,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'E-Box Elements/*drug effects/genetics', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nylons/chemical synthesis/*chemistry', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Pyrroles/*chemistry', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4406810,['NIHMS657329'],2015/01/23 06:00,2015/08/05 06:00,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2014/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12610 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2015 Apr;106(4):421-9. doi: 10.1111/cas.12610.

This study defines the immunohistochemical profile of AHSP, as compared with an established erythroid marker CD71, in 101 bone marrow biopsies including normal marrows and cases of acute pure erythroid leukemia, acute erythroid/myeloid leukemia, other types of acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelogenous leukemia, other types of myeloproliferative neoplasm, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, plasma cell neoplasm, and metastatic carcinoma. In acute pure erythroid leukemia, blasts in 7 of 11 cases showed similar reactivity for CD71 and AHSP, whereas less extensive reactivity was observed for AHSP as compared with CD71 in the remaining 4 cases. In normal marrows and other various disorders, reactivity for AHSP was similar to CD71 and was restricted to the erythroid lineage. Mature erythrocytes were negative for AHSP as were myeloblasts, lymphoblasts, nonerythroid hematopoietic marrow elements, plasma cells, and carcinoma cells. AHSP is an effective marker for detection of normal or abnormal erythroid precursors in bone marrow biopsies and is a useful addition to an immunohistochemical panel for assessment of neoplastic cells of possible erythroid derivation.","['Yu, Hongbo', 'Pinkus, Jack L', 'Pinkus, Geraldine S']","['Yu H', 'Pinkus JL', 'Pinkus GS']","[""*Department of Pathology, UMass Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester daggerDepartment of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'Blood Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Erythroid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Chaperones/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2015/01/23 06:00,2016/09/13 06:00,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000139 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2016 Jan;24(1):51-6. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000139.,"['0 (AHSP protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recently developed BRAF V600E mutation-specific antibody has evolved into a feasible alternative to DNA analysis. The plethora of immunohistochemical protocols makes implementation tedious and, here we tested a set of manual and automated protocols and compared test performance with sequencing results. For assays, we employed formalin-fixed, in part decalcified, and paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Empiric testing of manual protocols included 10 variables in 17 protocols. Automated immunohistochemical staining and BRAF pyrosequencing served as independent test methods. Test performance measures were compared without considering 1 method as a standard. Four well-fixed samples (2WT/2Mut) were used for testing of all protocols and indicated 2 correctly classifying procedures. Practical performance assessment employed 33 independent tissue samples, composed of 27 leukemias (by pyrosequencing: 8 wild-type; 18 mutated; 1 noninformative) and 6 melanomas (V600E; V600K; wild-type, 2 each). Manual V600E staining was positive in 20 cases (19 of 20 V600E-containing samples plus the 1 sample that was noninformative), whereas all wild-type and V600K cases were immunonegative. Manual or automated staining as well as pyrosequencing would have missed an equal number of V600E-mutated cases and the correlation coefficient for these methods was 0.75 to 0.93 (substantial to almost perfect); the Youden index was 0.95. Detection of V600E-mutated BRAF at the protein level in routine and decalcified tissue samples is possible, and the presented manual protocols should expedite implementation in routine diagnostic practice. Our results indicate that both molecular techniques should be considered complementary.","['Dinges, Hanns C', 'Capper, David', 'Ritz, Olga', 'Bruderlein, Silke', 'Marienfeld, Ralf', 'von Deimling, Andreas', 'Moller, Peter', 'Lennerz, Jochen K']","['Dinges HC', 'Capper D', 'Ritz O', 'Bruderlein S', 'Marienfeld R', 'von Deimling A', 'Moller P', 'Lennerz JK']","['*Division of Molecular Diagnostics, Institute of Pathology, University Ulm, Ulm daggerDepartment of Neuropathology and Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuropathology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Institute of Pathology, Ruprecht-Karls-Universitat Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,IM,"['Aspartic Acid/metabolism', 'Automation, Laboratory', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Decalcification Technique', 'Formaldehyde', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*standards', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Melanoma/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Valine/metabolism']",,,2015/01/23 06:00,2016/02/09 06:00,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000092 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2015 May-Jun;23(5):382-8. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000092.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombosis, bleeding, microcirculatory symptoms, pruritus, and risk of leukemic or fibrotic transformation. DIAGNOSIS: PV is defined by a JAK2 mutation, whose absence, combined with normal or increased serum erythropoietin level, makes the diagnosis unlikely. Differential diagnosis in ET includes reactive thrombocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, and prefibrotic myelofibrosis. Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), calreticulin (CALR), or myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) mutations occur in approximately 55%, 25%, and 3% of ET patients, respectively. The same molecular markers are also present in prefibrotic myelofibrosis, which needs to be morphologically distinguished from ET. Survival and leukemic/fibrotic transformation: Median survivals are approximately 14 years for PV and 20 years for ET; the corresponding values for younger patients are 24 and 33 years. Life-expectancy in ET is inferior to the control population. JAK2/CALR mutational status does not affect survival in ET. Risk factors for survival in ET and PV include advanced age, leukocytosis, and thrombosis. Leukemic transformation rates at 20 years are estimated at <10% for PV and 5% for ET; fibrotic transformation rates are slightly higher. Thrombosis risk stratification: Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of recurrent thrombosis: high-risk is defined by the presence of age >60 years or presence of thrombosis history; low-risk is defined by the absence of both of these two risk factors. Recent data consider JAK2V617F and cardiovascular risk factors as additional risk factors. Presence of extreme thrombocytosis might be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The main goal of therapy in PV and ET is to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications. In low risk patients, this is accomplished by the use of low-dose aspirin and phlebotomy (hematocrit target <45%) in PV. In high risk (for thrombosis) patients, treatment with hydroxyurea is additionally recommended. Treatment with busulfan or interferon-alpha is usually effective in hydroxyurea failures and the additional value of JAK inhibitor therapy in such cases is limited. Screening for AvWS is recommended before administrating aspirin, in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Barbui, Tiziano']","['Tefferi A', 'Barbui T']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Aspirin/*therapeutic use', 'Calreticulin/genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/pathology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Thrombocytosis/diagnosis/pathology']",,,2015/01/23 06:00,2015/03/20 06:00,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2014/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.23895 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Feb;90(2):162-73. doi: 10.1002/ajh.23895.,"['0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,"['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,['Am J Hematol. 2015 Sep;90(9):849.

Serial national and international clinical trials have optimized the use of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and, along with improvements in supportive care that have enabled the delivery of more intensive regimens, have been responsible for the major improvements in patient outcome seen over the past few decades. However, the benefits of dose intensification have likely now been maximized, and over the same period, the identification of new cytotoxic drugs has been limited. Therefore, challenges remain if survival is to be improved further. In pediatric ALL, 5-year-survival rates of over 85% have been achieved with risk-stratified therapy, but a notable minority of patients will still not be cured. In pediatric AML, different challenges remain. A slower improvement in overall survival has taken place in this patient population. Despite the obvious morphological heterogeneity of AML blasts, biological stratification is comparatively limited, and translation into risk-stratified therapeutic approaches has only best characterized by the use of retinoic acid for t(15;17)-positive AML. Even where prognostic markers have been identified, limited therapeutic options or multi-drug resistance of AML blasts has limited the impact on patient benefit. For both, the acute morbidities of current treatment remain significant and may be life-threatening alone. In addition, the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) highlighted many leukemia survivors develop one or more chronic medical conditions attributable to treatment (1, 2). As the biology of leukemogenesis has become better understood, key molecules and intracellular pathways have been identified that offer the possibility of targeting directly the leukemia cells while sparing normal cells. Consequently, there is now a drive to develop novel leukemia-specific or ""targeted"" therapies. These new classes of drugs will have mechanisms of action, toxicities, and therapeutic indices quite different from conventional cytotoxic drugs previously encountered, thus rendering current clinical trial methodologies inappropriate. Clinical trial methods will need to be adapted to accommodate these features of these new classes of drugs. This review will address the challenges and some of the techniques for developing clinical trials for targeted therapies.","['Mussai, Francis Jay', 'Yap, Christina', 'Mitchell, Christopher', 'Kearns, Pamela']","['Mussai FJ', 'Yap C', 'Mitchell C', 'Kearns P']","['School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham , Birmingham , UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham , Birmingham , UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford , Oxford , UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham , Birmingham , UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150106,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,PMC4285052,,2015/01/23 06:00,2015/01/23 06:01,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2014/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2014.00374 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2015 Jan 6;4:374. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2014.00374. eCollection 2014.,,['NOTNLM'],"['leukemia', 'pediatric', 'phase', 'targeted', 'trial']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Injection of either fluorescently-labelled ACRs or blebs alone did not affect the number or distribution of migrated DC subsets from skin biopsies after 48 hours, but resulted in a general up-regulation of the co-stimulatory molecules CD83 and CD86 on skin DCs that had ingested apoptotic material. We have previously shown that i.d. administration of GM-CSF and IL-4 resulted in preferential migration of a mature and highly T cell-stimulatory CD11(hi)CD1a(+)CD14(-) dermal DC subset. Here, we found that co-injection of GM-CSF and IL-4 together with either ACRs or blebs resulted in uptake efficiencies within this dermal DC subset of 7.6% (+/-6.1%) and 19.1% (+/-15.9%), respectively, thus revealing a significantly higher uptake frequency of blebs (P < 0.02). Intradermal delivery of tumor-derived blebs did not affect the T-cell priming and TH-skewing abilities of migratory skin DC. Nevertheless, in contrast to i.d. administration of ACR, the injection of blebs lead to effective cross-presentation of MART-1 to specific CD8(+) effector T cells. We conclude that apoptotic bleb-based vaccines delivered through the skin may offer an attractive, and broadly applicable, cancer immunotherapy.","['Ruben, Jurjen M', 'Bontkes, Hetty J', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Hooijberg, Erik', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'de Gruijl, Tanja D']","['Ruben JM', 'Bontkes HJ', 'Westers TM', 'Hooijberg E', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'de Gruijl TD']","['Department of Hematology; VU University Medical Center; Cancer Center Amsterdam ; Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology; VU University Medical Center; Cancer Center Amsterdam ; Amsterdam, The Netherlands ; Department of Pathology; VU University Medical Center; Cancer Center Amsterdam ; Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology; VU University Medical Center; Cancer Center Amsterdam ; Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology; VU University Medical Center; Cancer Center Amsterdam ; Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology; VU University Medical Center; Cancer Center Amsterdam ; Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology; VU University Medical Center; Cancer Center Amsterdam ; Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology; VU University Medical Center; Cancer Center Amsterdam ; Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140703,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,PMC4292219,,2015/01/23 06:00,2015/01/23 06:01,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2014/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4161/21624011.2014.946360 [doi]', '946360 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2014 Jul 3;3(7):e946360. doi: 10.4161/21624011.2014.946360. eCollection 2014.,,['NOTNLM'],"['*4/GM, IL-4 and GM-CSF', '*ACR, apoptotic cell remnant', '*AML, acute myeloid leukemia', '*CFSE, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester', '*DC, dendritic cell', '*DDC, dermal DC', '*GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor', '*HLA, human leukocyte antigen', '*HSCT, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*IFN, interferon', '*IL, interleukin', '*Ig, immune globulin', '*LC, Langerhans cell', '*LN, lymph node', '*MART-1/melan-A, melanoma antigen recognized by T cell 1', '*MLR, mixed leukocyte reaction', '*MoDC, monocyte-derived dendritic cell', '*TAA, tumor-associated antigen', '*TH, T Helper', '*TLR, Toll-like receptor', '*TNFalpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha', '*apoptotic cells', '*blebs', '*cross-presentation', '*dendritic cells', '*dermis', '*i.d., intradermal', '*phagocytosis', '*skin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feline calicivirus (FCV) and feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) are the main primary pathogens. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are also among the most common infectious diseases of cats which suppress the immunity. Oropharyngeal and conjunctival swabs and blood samples were taken from 16 cats with clinical signs of URTD and 26 clinically healthy cats. PCR and RT-PCR were used to detect FHV/FIV or FCV/FeLV infections, respectively. Feline calicivirus was detected in all cats with URTD and 87.00% and 93.00% of them were positive for FIV and FeLV, respectively. Feline herpesvirus rate of infection was 43.00% in sick cats. In clinically normal cats, prevalence rates of FCV and FHV were about 50.00%, but FIV and FeLV rates (42.00% and 65.00% respectively) were higher compared to other studies. Stomatitis was observed in 50.00% of cats with URTD. The main causative agent of corneal ulcers is FHV-1, but in 50.00% of cats with corneal ulcers, FCV was detected alone. It seems new variants of Caliciviruses are the main causative agents to attack uncommon tissues like cornea, although retroviral infections may be in the background of these various signs. The high retroviral prevalence may be due to existence of large population of stray cats. This is the first molecular study of FeLV and FCV in Iran and seems that FCV and FHV prevalence rates in FIV or FeLV infected cats is more than other non-infected ones.","['Najafi, Hamideh', 'Madadgar, Omid', 'Jamshidi, Shahram', 'Ghalyanchi Langeroudi, Arash', 'Darzi Lemraski, Mahdieh']","['Najafi H', 'Madadgar O', 'Jamshidi S', 'Ghalyanchi Langeroudi A', 'Darzi Lemraski M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran;', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran;', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran;', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran;']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Vet Res Forum,Veterinary research forum : an international quarterly journal,101625812,,,PMC4299990,,2015/01/23 06:00,2015/01/23 06:01,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2013/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/23 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Vet Res Forum. 2014 Fall;5(4):255-61.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Corneal ulcers', 'Feline calicivirus', 'Feline herpesvirus type 1', 'Feline retroviruses', 'Respiratory disease']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three days before he applied to our clinic, he was prescribed a single dose of 200 mg quetiapine by a psychiatry polyclinic for the complication of insomnia. Nearly 6 hours after the first dose of quetiapine, an involuntary erection occurred with accompanying pain in the penis. The patient waited for spontaneous detumescence without consulting a psychiatrist. After the patient had waited for 48 hours without any change, he applied to our clinic. Other etiologic factors of priapism were excluded (such as malignancy, blood dyscrasia, leukemia, and trauma).

It selectively inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases. Its effects limit the use of this drug. We present a case with a serious skin reaction requiring the discontinuation of the drug and that developed in relation to imatinib therapy. Six months prior, a 61-year-old male patient presenting to the hematology polyclinic with complaints of weight loss and sweating was hospitalized due to high leukocyte value. As a result of the hemogram, biochemistry analyses, peripheral blood smear examination, bone marrow aspiration evaluation, cytogenetic examination using FISH and PCR that were performed, CML was diagnosed. Additionally, to exclude myelofibrosis, we examined a bone marrow biopsy. Imatinib mesylate was started at 400 mg/day orally. In the fourth month of treatment, the patient complained of itching and a skin rash. Although the drug dose was reduced (300 mg/day), his complaints gradually increased. The skin biopsy result was superficial perivascular dermatitis. Imatinib was discontinued, and the patient was started on corticosteroid. The lesions disappeared completely. A month later, the patient was restarted on imatinib mesylate. However, the lesions recurred more prominently. His itching increased. The patient was considered intolerant to imatinib mesylate, and a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dasatinib 100 mg/day, was started orally. The follow-up and treatment continues for the patient, who has been taking dasatinib 100 mg/day for the last two months without any skin finding or complaints. Imatinib mesylate-induced skin reactions are associated with the pharmacologic effect of the drug rather than hypersensitivity to the drug. Skin reactions are frequently observed, and this side effect is dose dependent. However, the interesting aspect of our case was that despite dose reduction, skin findings gradually increased, and eventually the drug had to be discontinued.","['Albayrak, Murat', 'Celebi, Harika', 'Albayrak, Aynur', 'Can, Esra Saribacak', 'Aslan, Vedat', 'Onec, Birgul', 'Coban, Ipek']","['Albayrak M', 'Celebi H', 'Albayrak A', 'Can ES', 'Aslan V', 'Onec B', 'Coban I']","['Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Education and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Hakkari State Hospital, Hakkari, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],,Turkey,Eurasian J Med,The Eurasian journal of medicine,101557701,,,PMC4261397,,2011/12/01 00:00,2011/12/01 00:01,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2011/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.5152/eajm.2011.42 [doi]', 'eajm-43-3-192 [pii]']",ppublish,Eurasian J Med. 2011 Dec;43(3):192-5. doi: 10.5152/eajm.2011.42.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML)', 'Imatinib', 'Skin lesions']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In total, 54 PDPH episodes were reported in both groups. The rate of headache due to the LP was significantly higher in the first group than in the second group (48.8% vs. 16.4%, p<0.001). On the other hand, the severity of pain was also significantly higher in the first group (mean pain scores were 5.6 +/- 1.62 vs. 3.07 +/- 1.18, p<0.001). Furthermore, two patients from the first group (11.11%) developed generalized convulsion attacks, and one of those patients experienced pulmonary arrest necessitating respiratory support. No serious complications were observed in the second group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that isotonic saline injection into the epidural space after LP is a safe and effective approach to prevent PDPH and related complications.","['Kiki, Ilhami', 'Gundogdu, Mehmet', 'Alici, H Ahmet', 'Yildirim, Rahsan', 'Bilici, Mehmet']","['Kiki I', 'Gundogdu M', 'Alici HA', 'Yildirim R', 'Bilici M']","['Ataturk University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine/ Hematology, Erzurum, Turkey.', 'Ataturk University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine/ Hematology, Erzurum, Turkey.', 'Ataturk University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, Erzurum, Turkey.', 'Ataturk University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine/ Hematology, Erzurum, Turkey.', 'Ataturk University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine/ Oncology, Erzurum, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Eurasian J Med,The Eurasian journal of medicine,101557701,,,PMC4261270,,2009/12/01 00:00,2009/12/01 00:01,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eurasian J Med. 2009 Dec;41(3):175-9.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Central nervous system prophylaxis', 'Epidural saline injection', 'Post-dural puncture headache']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cancer medicine, the use of nanoparticles (NPs) drug delivery system (DDS) can sustainedly release anticancer drug at the specific site and reduce the incidence of toxicity in normal tissues. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the benefit of a novel chemotherapeutic DDS and its underlying mechanisms. Daunorubicin (DNR) was loaded into poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-poly-L-lysine (PLL)-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-transferrin (Tf) NPs to construct DNR-PLGA-PLL-PEG-Tf-NPs (DNR-loaded NPs) as a DDS. After incubating with PLGA-PLL-PEG-Tf-NPs, DNR, and DNR-loaded NPs, the leukemia K562 cells were collected and the intracellular concentration of DNR was detected by flow cytometry, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of drugs on the growth of tumors in K562 xenografts was observed and the relevant toxicity of therapeutic drugs on organs was investigated in vivo. Meanwhile, cell apoptosis in the excised xenografts was measured by transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay, and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, including Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-9, Caspase-3, and cleaved-PARP, was determined by Western blotting analysis. Results showed that DNR-loaded NPs increased intracellular concentration of DNR in K562 cells in vitro and induced a remarkable improvement in anticancer activity in the xenografts in vivo. The expression of Bcl-2 protein was downregulated and that of Bax, Caspase-9, Caspase-3, and cleaved-PARP proteins were obviously upregulated in the DNR-loaded NPs group than that in other ones. Interestingly, pathological assessment showed no apparent damage to the main organs. In summary, the results obtained from this study showed that the novel NPs DDS could improve the efficacy of DNR in the treatment of leukemia and induce apoptosis via intrinsic pathway. Thus, it can be inferred that the new drug delivery may be a useful clinical tool.","['Bao, Wen', 'Liu, Ran', 'Wang, Yonglu', 'Wang, Fei', 'Xia, Guohua', 'Zhang, Haijun', 'Li, Xueming', 'Yin, Haixiang', 'Chen, Baoan']","['Bao W', 'Liu R', 'Wang Y', 'Wang F', 'Xia G', 'Zhang H', 'Li X', 'Yin H', 'Chen B']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Medical Disciplines of Jiangsu Province, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Medical Disciplines of Jiangsu Province, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Medical Disciplines of Jiangsu Province, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China ; College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Medical Disciplines of Jiangsu Province, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Medical Disciplines of Jiangsu Province, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Medical Disciplines of Jiangsu Province, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Technology, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Medical Disciplines of Jiangsu Province, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150112,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Daunorubicin/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Polyesters/*chemistry', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry', 'Polylysine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Transferrin/*chemistry', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4298335,,2015/01/23 06:00,2016/04/22 06:00,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S75090 [doi]', 'ijn-10-557 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2015 Jan 12;10:557-66. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S75090. eCollection 2015.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Polyesters)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (monomethoxy (polyethylene glycol)-poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-poly(lysine))', '25104-18-1 (Polylysine)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",['NOTNLM'],"['K562 cells', 'PLGA-PLL-PEG', 'apoptosis', 'daunorubicin', 'transferrin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective analysis of seven cases and review of the literature.,301-5,10.1136/jclinpath-2014-202740 [doi],"AIMS: Pure erythroid leukaemia (PEL) is a rare subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and its clinicopathological features are not well-defined. The aim of this study was to describe the immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and clinical features of PEL and to compare these with cases of AML with >/= 50% erythroblasts. METHODS: Cases of PEL according to WHO morphological criteria diagnosed at three institutions from 1997 to 2013 were included. A comparison cohort comprised of AML with >/= 50% erythroblasts. The clinical, histopathology, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic features of cases were analysed. We also reviewed the existing literature on PEL, and combined our cohort with previously reported cases of PEL in a pooled analysis. RESULTS: There were seven cases of PEL diagnosed at our institutions. There was a high incidence of either prior chemoradiotherapy exposure or evolution from pre-existing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (71%). The leukaemic blasts frequently expressed glycophorin C (100%), CD117 (83%) and were myeloperoxidase negative (83%). Complex karyotypes were present in 83% of cases. Median overall survival was 2.9 months. Compared with AML with >/= 50% erythroblasts, cases of PEL demonstrated a higher incidence of adverse-risk cytogenetics (p=0.01) and prior exposure to chemoradiotherapy (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: PEL appears to be a unique entity that is often secondary or therapy related, commonly features a complex karyotype and has a poor prognosis. It is morphologically and immunophenotypically distinct from other cases of AML with erythroid hyperplasia.","['Wong, Eric', 'Ling, Victoria', 'Westerman, David', 'Morgan, Susan', 'Juneja, Surender']","['Wong E', 'Ling V', 'Westerman D', 'Morgan S', 'Juneja S']","['Department of Diagnostic Haematology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Diagnostic Haematology, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Diagnostic Haematology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Review']",20150121,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Erythroblasts/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotype', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/classification/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/genetics/immunology/pathology/thera py', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Victoria/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/01/23 06:00,2015/05/21 06:00,['2015/01/23 06:00'],"['2015/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['jclinpath-2014-202740 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2014-202740 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2015 Apr;68(4):301-5. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2014-202740.

Recent research shows that aberrant DNA methylation patterning may play a role in leukemogenesis. The epigenetic silencing of the EBF3 locus is very frequent in glioblastoma. However, the expression profiles and molecular function of EBF3 in pediatric AML is still unclear. METHODS: Twelve human acute leukemia cell lines, 105 pediatric AML samples and 30 normal bone marrow/idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (NBM/ITP) control samples were analyzed. Transcriptional level of EBF3 was evaluated by semi-quantitative and real-time PCR. EBF3 methylation status was determined by methylation specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS). The molecular mechanism of EBF3 was investigated by apoptosis assays and PCR array analysis. RESULTS: EBF3 promoter was hypermethylated in 10/12 leukemia cell lines. Aberrant EBF3 methylation was observed in 42.9% (45/105) of the pediatric AML samples using MSP analysis, and the BGS results confirmed promoter methylation. EBF3 expression was decreased in the AML samples compared with control. Methylated samples revealed similar survival outcomes by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. EBF3 overexpression significantly inhibited cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Real-time PCR array analysis revealed 93 dysregulated genes possibly implicated in the apoptosis of EBF3-induced AML cells. CONCLUSION: In this study, we firstly identified epigenetic inactivation of EBF3 in both AML cell lines and pediatric AML samples for the first time. Our findings also showed for the first time that transcriptional overexpression of EBF3 could inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in AML cells. We identified 93 dysregulated apoptosis-related genes in EBF3-overexpressing, including DCC, AIFM2 and DAPK1. Most of these genes have never been related with EBF3 over expression. These results may provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of EBF3-induced apoptosis; however, further research will be required to determine the underlying details. Our findings suggest that EBF3 may act as a putative tumor suppressor gene in pediatric AML.","['Tao, Yan-Fang', 'Xu, Li-Xiao', 'Lu, Jun', 'Hu, Shao-Yan', 'Fang, Fang', 'Cao, Lan', 'Xiao, Pei-Fang',

Reports on the prognostic significance of DNMT3A mutations have been inconsistent, and most of the data are available only for patients 60 years of age or younger. We hypothesized that this inconsistency is due to an interaction between the dose of anthracycline used in induction therapy and DNMT3A status. We studied whether patients with DNMT3A-mutated AML treated with standard dose anthracyclines had an inferior survival compared with patients with other mutation profiles or those who received high-dose therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 152 patients in this retrospective cohort study (median age, 54 years) with de novo AML underwent induction therapy and next-generation sequencing of 33 commonly mutated genes in hematologic malignancies, including DNMT3A, FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and IDH1/2. Cox regression was used to know whether those with DNMT3A mutations who were treated with standard dose anthracycline had inferior survival. RESULTS: DNMT3A mutations, found in 32% of patients, were not associated with an inferior survival. Dose escalation of anthracycline in the induction regimen was associated with improved survival in those with DNMT3A mutations but not those with wild-type DNMT3A. Patients with DNMT3A mutations who received standard dose induction had shorter survival time than other patient groups (10.1 months vs. 19.8 months, P = 0.0129). This relationship remained significant (HR, 1.90; P = 0.006) controlling for multiple variables. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DNMT3A-mutated AML have an inferior survival when treated with standard-dose anthracycline induction therapy. This group should be considered for high-dose induction therapy.","['Sehgal, Alison R', 'Gimotty, Phyllis A', 'Zhao, Jianhua', 'Hsu, Jing-Mei', 'Daber, Robert', 'Morrissette, Jennifer D', 'Luger, Selina', 'Loren, Alison W', 'Carroll, Martin']","['Sehgal AR', 'Gimotty PA', 'Zhao J', 'Hsu JM', 'Daber R', 'Morrissette JD', 'Luger S', 'Loren AW', 'Carroll M']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Recent studies have shown aberrant expression of SOX11 in various types of aggressive B cell neoplasms. In this study, we have analyzed SOX11 transcription levels in 86 patients with diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Results were correlated with well-known prognostic factors such as immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) gene mutational status, cytogenetics risk groups and clinicopathological characteristics of the disease. Overall, 35 % of cases showed SOX11 expression; meanwhile, the remaining 65 % lacked gene expression. The analysis taking into account the IGHV mutational status showed significant differences in SOX11 transcripts levels between mutated (0.004 +/- 0.0001) and unmutated CLL patients (0.405 +/- 0.011) (p < 0.0001), as well as a positive correlation between SOX11 mRNA expression and the percentage of IGHV homology (p = 0.0001). Furthermore, significantly lower SOX11 mRNA expression was detected in patients with deletion 13q14 as a single alteration (0.016 +/- 0.008) than those observed in cases with deletions 11q/17p (0.35 +/- 0.017) (p = 0.02). The correlation of gene expression with clinical evolution showed shorter treatment free survival (p = 0.043) and overall survival (p = 0.047) in SOX11 positive patients compared to SOX11 negative cases.

Ribavirin administration blocked the growth of primary breast tumors in several murine models and reduced the development of lung metastases in an invasive model. Mechanistically, eIF4E silencing or blockade reduced the invasiveness and metastatic capability of breast cancer cells in a manner associated with decreased activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-9. Furthermore, eIF4E silencing or ribavirin treatment suppressed features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process crucial for metastasis.

Bone marrow samples were obtained from 30 cases of MDS (MDS group) and 30 healthy donors (control group). The expression pattern of cytokines was detected by customized protein array. The karyotypes of MSCs were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Compared with the control group, leukemia inhibitory factor, stem cell factor (SCF), stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1), bone morphogenetic protein 4, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) stimulating factor, and transforming growth factor-beta in the MDS group were significantly downregulated (P<0.05), while interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and programmed death ligand (B7-H1) were significantly upregulated (P<0.05). For chromosome abnormality analysis, the detection rate of abnormal karyotypes (+8, -8, -20, 20q-, -Y, -7, 5q-) was 30% in the MDS group and 0% in the control group. In conclusion, the up- and downregulated expression of these cytokines might play a key role in the pathogenesis of MDS. Among them, SCF and SDF-1 may play roles in the apoptosis of HSCs in MDS; and IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and B7-H1 may be associated with apoptosis of bone marrow cells in MDS. In addition, the abnormal karyotypes might be actively involved in the pathogenesis of MDS. Further studies are required to determine the role of abnormal karyotypes in the occurrence and development of MDS.","['Xiong, H', 'Yang, X Y', 'Han, J', 'Wang, Q', 'Zou, Z L']","['Xiong H', 'Yang XY', 'Han J', 'Wang Q', 'Zou ZL']","['Department of Hematology, Shanghai Clinical Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Xuhui District Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Clinical Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Xuhui District Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Clinical Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Xuhui District Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Clinical Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Xuhui District Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Clinical Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai Xuhui District Central Hospital, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150120,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,IM,"['*Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytokines/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phenotype']",PMC4381940,,2015/01/22 06:00,2016/11/01 06:00,['2015/01/22 06:00'],"['2014/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0100-879X2015005044051 [pii]', '10.1590/1414-431X20144051 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2015 Mar;48(3):207-13. doi: 10.1590/1414-431X20144051.

The expression and activation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) and Akt were also investigated. Upregulation of Aiolos inhibited cell growth and arrested an increased number of Nalm6 cells at the G0/G1 phase. The apoptotic cell quantities were also significantly lower in the Aiolostransfected Nalm6 cells. In addition, Aiolos overexpression downregulated PTEN, but increased the expression and phosphorylation of Akt in the Nalm6 cells. The Akt inhibitor, Akti1/2, reduced the percentage of viable Aiolosoverexpressed Nalm6 cells, however, it had no effect on cell cycle arrest or proliferation. Aiolos upregulation in the Nalm6 cells inhibited cell proliferation, suppressed apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. Aiolos improved the survival of Nalm6 cells via PTEN and Aktdependent processes.","['Wang, Ran', 'Guo, Gang', 'Li, Hao', 'Li, Xiangxin', 'Yu, Yuan', 'Li, Dong']","['Wang R', 'Guo G', 'Li H', 'Li X', 'Yu Y', 'Li D']","[""Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Ji'nan, Shandong 250012, P.R.

In the cytosol-membrane, it negatively regulates PI3K-AKT pathway through the de-phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), therefore blocking one of the major signaling transduction pathways in tumorigenesis. In the nucleus, PTEN controls genomic stability and cellular proliferation through phosphatase independent mechanisms. Importantly, impairments in PTEN cellular compartmentalization, changes in protein levels and post-transductional modifications affect PTEN tumor suppressive functions. Targeting mechanisms that inactivate PTEN promotes apoptosis induction of cancer cells, without affecting normal cells, with appealing therapeutic implications. Recently, we have shown that BCR-ABL promotes PTEN nuclear exclusion by favoring HAUSP mediated PTEN de-ubiquitination in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia. Here, we show that nuclear exclusion of PTEN is associated with PTEN inactivation in the cytoplasm of CML cells. In particular, BCR-ABL promotes Casein Kinase II-mediated PTEN tail phosphorylation with consequent inhibition of the phosphatase activity toward PIP3. Targeting Casein Kinase II promotes PTEN reactivation with apoptosis induction. We therefore propose a novel BCR-ABL/CKII/PTEN pathway as a potential target to achieve synthetic lethality with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Morotti, Alessandro', 'Panuzzo, Cristina', 'Crivellaro, Sabrina', 'Carra, Giovanna', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Guerrasio, Angelo', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Morotti A', 'Panuzzo C', 'Crivellaro S', 'Carra G', 'Fava C', 'Guerrasio A', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Saglio G']","['a Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences; San Luigi Hospital ; Orbassano - Turin University ; Turin , Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Animals', 'Casein Kinase II/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational']",PMC4615112,,2015/01/22 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2015/01/22 06:00'],"['2015/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384101.2015.1006970 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2015;14(7):973-9. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2015.1006970.,"['0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (Pten protein, mouse)']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'PTEN', 'casein kinase II', 'tumor suppressor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The classic MRI protocol for the study of BM and BME includes T1- and T2-weighted sequences, the STIR sequence, and in some cases, the administration of intravenous contrast agents in T1-weighted sequences. Fifty-four patients were investigated; there were identified 30 patients with MRI features of BME. Out of the 30 patients with BME, 24 were known to have a malignant hematological disease (multiple myeloma, leukemia, lymphoma); for the remaining subjects, imagistic findings and other laboratory investigations led to multiple myeloma diagnosis. Of the 30 patients, six showed characteristic lesions of the underlying disease as well as BME; four patients had only BME. BM is a structure that is commonly investigated using MRI scans, regardless of the examined bone segment. T1-weighted images and T2-weighted with fat suppression are essential for BME evaluation.

It plays a critical role in cancer cell development, proliferation, motility and survival. It is suggested that the human tumor related gene CHP2 expression in leukemia primary cells and leukemia cell lines significantly increase, which may play an important role in growth process of leukemia cells. METHODS: In this study, the expression of CHP2 gene was analyzed in 10 normal healthy controls and 40 patients with de novo acute leukemia (20 AML and 20 ALL). CHP2 expression was analyzed using a real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTQ-PCR) to investigate a possible relation, association or correlation with the clinical features of AL (acute leukemia) at diagnosis, such as age, gender, lineage, HB, TLC, platelet count, BM blast cell infiltration and risk group. RESULTS: CHP2 was highly expressed in 13/40 AL studied patients (7/20 AML and 6/20 ALL) with mean expression level of 2.7 while it was not expressed in any of the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Many studies suggest that CHP2 expression is a novel prognostic marker in AL and thus needs to be incorporated into the patient stratification and treatment protocols. In addition, a quarter of AL patients fail therapy and novel treatments that are focused on undermining specifically the leukemic process are needed urgently.","['Hammam, Amira Ahmed', 'Eissa, Hisham Hasan', 'El Masry, Mohamed Roshdy', 'Mahmoud, Sarah']","['Hammam AA', 'Eissa HH', 'El Masry MR', 'Mahmoud S']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Beni Suef University, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Beni Suef University, Egypt.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty OF Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Beni Suef University, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140505,Netherlands,Meta Gene,Meta gene,101627670,,,PMC4287875,,2015/01/22 06:00,2015/01/22 06:01,['2015/01/22 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2014/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.mgene.2014.04.001 [doi]', 'S2214-5400(14)00019-X [pii]']",epublish,Meta Gene. 2014 May 5;2:323-31. doi: 10.1016/j.mgene.2014.04.001. eCollection 2014 Dec.,,['NOTNLM'],"['AL', 'CHP2', 'RTQ-PCR']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most therapy-related myeloid neoplasms after treatment for APL are classified as therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome or therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia. Translocation of 5q31-33, PDGFRB occur rarely in therapy-related myeloid neoplasm and there has been two identified PDGFRB partner genes located at 14q32, TRIP11 and KIAA1509. RESULTS: The TRIP11-PDGFRB fusion was identified in a patient with therapy-related myeloid neoplasm with t(5;14)(q33;q32) after treatment of APL using conventional cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and molecular methods. Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow aspirate revealed 46, XY, t(5;14)(q33;q32) in all 20 analyzed cells. No other cytogenetic abnormalities were observed. Break-apart FISH analysis demonstrated that rearrangement of PDGFRB at 5q33 was positive in 460 of 500 cells analyzed, while the PML-RARA rearrangement remained undetectable by RT-PCR. Sequencing of RT-PCR products revealed fusion between exon 16 of TRIP11 and exon 11 of PDGFRB. However, the KIAA1509-PDGFRB fusion was not detected by RT-PCR. CONCLUSION: We firstly demonstrated that therapy-related myeloid neoplasm with TRIP11-PDGFRB fusion was identified after treatment of APL.","['Kim, Hoon-Gu', 'Jang, Ja-Hyun', 'Koh, Eun-Ha']","['Kim HG', 'Jang JH', 'Koh EH']","['Departments of Internal Medicine, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine, 79 Gangnam-ro, Jinju, Korea.', 'Green Cross Laboratories, Yongin, Korea.', 'Departments of Laboratory Medicine, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine, 79 Gangnam-ro, 660-702 Jinju, Korea ; Institute of Heath Sciences, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine, Jinju, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20141223,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,PMC4299380,,2015/01/22 06:00,2015/01/22 06:01,['2015/01/22 06:00'],"['2014/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-014-0103-6 [doi]', '103 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2014 Dec 23;7(1):103. doi: 10.1186/s13039-014-0103-6. eCollection 2014.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'PDGFRB', 'TRIP11', 'Therapy-related myeloid neoplasm', 't(5;14)(q33;32)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone anabolic stimuli activate Wnt signaling, and human mutations of components along this pathway underscore its crucial role in bone accrual and maintenance. However, the cell responsible for orchestrating Wnt anabolic actions has remained elusive. We show herein that activation of canonical Wnt signaling exclusively in osteocytes [dominant active (da)betacat(Ot) mice] induces bone anabolism and triggers Notch signaling without affecting survival. These features contrast with those of mice expressing the same dass-catenin in osteoblasts, which exhibit decreased resorption and perinatal death from leukemia. dasscat(Ot) mice exhibit increased bone mineral density in the axial and appendicular skeleton, and marked increase in bone volume in cancellous/trabecular and cortical compartments compared with littermate controls. dasscat(Ot) mice display increased resorption and formation markers, high number of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in cancellous and cortical bone, increased bone matrix production, and markedly elevated periosteal bone formation rate. Wnt and Notch signaling target genes, osteoblast and osteocyte markers, and proosteoclastogenic and antiosteoclastogenic cytokines are elevated in bones of dasscat(Ot) mice. Further, the increase in RANKL depends on Sost/sclerostin. Thus, activation of osteocytic beta-catenin signaling increases both osteoclasts and osteoblasts, leading to bone gain, and is sufficient to activate the Notch pathway. These findings demonstrate disparate outcomes of beta-catenin activation in osteocytes versus osteoblasts and identify osteocytes as central target cells of the anabolic actions of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in bone.","['Tu, Xiaolin', 'Delgado-Calle, Jesus', 'Condon, Keith W', 'Maycas, Marta', 'Zhang, Huajia', 'Carlesso, Nadia', 'Taketo, Makoto M', 'Burr, David B', 'Plotkin, Lilian I', 'Bellido, Teresita']","['Tu X', 'Delgado-Calle J', 'Condon KW', 'Maycas M', 'Zhang H', 'Carlesso N', 'Taketo MM', 'Burr DB', 'Plotkin LI', 'Bellido T']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology and tbellido@iupui.edu xiaolint@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology and Roudebush Veterans Administration Medical Center and.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology and.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46022; and.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46022; and.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology and.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology and Roudebush Veterans Administration Medical Center and.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology and Roudebush Veterans Administration Medical Center and Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine; tbellido@iupui.edu xiaolint@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK097837/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'S10-RR023710/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK076007/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'IK6 BX004596/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'S10 RR023710/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK076007/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'I01 BX002104/BX/BLRD VA/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150120,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Density', 'Bone and Bones/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Osteocytes/*physiology', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",PMC4321271,,2015/01/22 06:00,2015/04/29 06:00,['2015/01/22 06:00'],"['2015/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1409857112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1409857112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Feb 3;112(5):E478-86. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1409857112.

Here we identify a mechanism that limits the inflammatory response. Probing the responses of macrophages to the key sensory Toll-like receptors, we identify that the Broad-complex, Tramtrack and Bric-a-brac/poxvirus and zinc finger (BTB/POZ), transcriptional regulator promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) limits the expression of inflammatory gene products. In accord with this finding, PLZF-deficient animals express higher levels of potent inflammatory cytokines and mount exaggerated inflammatory responses to infectious stimuli. Temporal quantitation of inflammatory gene transcripts shows increased gene induction in the absence of PLZF. Genome-wide analysis of histone modifications distinguish that PLZF establishes basal activity states of early response genes to maintain immune homeostasis and limit damaging inflammation. We show that PLZF stabilizes a corepressor complex that encompasses histone deacetylase activity to control chromatin. Together with our previous demonstration that PLZF promotes the antiviral response, these results suggest a strategy that could realize one of the major goals of immune therapy to retain immune resistance to pathogens while curbing damaging inflammation.","['Sadler, Anthony J', 'Rossello, Fernando J', 'Yu, Liang', 'Deane, James A', 'Yuan, Xiangliang', 'Wang, Die', 'Irving, Aaron T', 'Kaparakis-Liaskos, Maria', 'Gantier, Michael P', 'Ying, Hangjie', 'Yim, Howard C H', 'Hartland, Elizabeth L', 'Notini, Amanda J', 'de Boer, Suzan', 'White, Stefan J', 'Mansell, Ashley', 'Liu, Jun-Ping', 'Watkins, D Neil', 'Gerondakis, Steve', 'Williams, Bryan R G', 'Xu, Dakang']","['Sadler AJ', 'Rossello FJ', 'Yu L', 'Deane JA', 'Yuan X', 'Wang D', 'Irving AT', 'Kaparakis-Liaskos M', 'Gantier MP', 'Ying H', 'Yim HC', 'Hartland EL', 'Notini AJ', 'de Boer S', 'White SJ', 'Mansell A', 'Liu JP', 'Watkins DN', 'Gerondakis S', 'Williams BR', 'Xu D']","['MIMR-PHI Institute of Medical Research, Clayton, Victoria 3168, Australia;

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the ALL-BFM-SCT 2003 trial, MRD was assessed in the bone marrow at days +30, +60, +90, +180, and +365 after transplantation in 113 patients with relapsed disease. Standardized quantification of MRD was performed according to the guidelines of the Euro-MRD Group. RESULTS: All patients showed a 3-year probability of event-free survival (pEFS) of 55%. The cumulative incidence rates of relapse and treatment-related mortality were 32% and 12%, respectively. The pEFS was 60% for patients who received their transplantations in second complete remission, 50% for patients in >/= third complete remission, and 0% for patients not in remission (P = .015). At all time points, the level of MRD was inversely correlated with event-free survival (EFS; P < .004) and positively correlated with the cumulative incidence of relapse (P < .01). A multivariable Cox model was fitted for each time point, which showed that MRD >/= 10(-4) leukemic cells was consistently correlated with inferior EFS (P < .003). The accuracy of MRD measurements in predicting relapse was investigated with time-dependent receiver operating curves at days +30, +60, +90, and +180. From day +60 onward, the discriminatory power of MRD detection to predict the probability of relapse after 1, 3, 6, and 9 months was more than 96%, more than 87%, more than 71%, and more than 61%, respectively. CONCLUSION: MRD after transplantation was a reliable marker for predicting impending relapses and could thus serve as the basis for pre-emptive therapy.","['Bader, Peter', 'Kreyenberg, Hermann', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Salzmann-Manrique, Emilia', 'Meisel, Roland', 'Poetschger, Ulrike', 'Stachel, Daniel', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Alten, Julia', 'Schrauder, Andre', 'Schulz, Ansgar', 'Lang, Peter', 'Muller, Ingo', 'Albert, Michael H', 'Willasch, Andre M', 'Klingebiel, Thomas E', 'Peters, Christina']","['Bader P', 'Kreyenberg H', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Eckert C', 'Salzmann-Manrique E', 'Meisel R', 'Poetschger U', 'Stachel D', 'Schrappe M', 'Alten J', 'Schrauder A', 'Schulz A', 'Lang P', 'Muller I', 'Albert MH', 'Willasch AM', 'Klingebiel TE', 'Peters C']","[""Peter Bader, Hermann Kreyenberg, Emilia Salzmann-Manrique, Andre M.

When extensive (affecting >/= 30% of the epiphyseal surface), 80% of joints collapse within 2 years, so interventions are needed to prevent this outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening study included all consecutive children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia on a single protocol. Hip MRI was performed at 6.5 and 9 months from diagnosis (early screening) and at completion of chemotherapy (final evaluation) to determine whether screening could identify extensive hip osteonecrosis before symptom development. RESULTS: Of 498 patients, 462 underwent screening MRI. Extensive asymptomatic osteonecrosis was identified by early screening in 26 patients (41 hips); another four patients (seven hips) were detected after the screening period, such that screening sensitivity was 84.1% and specificity was 99.4%. The number of joints screened to detect one lesion was 20.1 joints for all patients, 4.4 joints for patients older than 10 years, and 198 joints for patients </= 10 years old (P < .001). Of the 40 extensive lesions in patients older than 10 years, 19 required total hip arthroplasty and none improved. Of eight extensive lesions in younger patients, none required arthroplasty and four improved. CONCLUSION: In patients age 10 years old or younger who require prolonged glucocorticoid therapy, screening for extensive hip osteonecrosis is unnecessary because their risk is low and lesions tend to heal. In children older than 10 years, early screening successfully identifies extensive asymptomatic lesions in patients who would be eligible for studies of interventions to prevent or delay joint collapse.","['Kaste, Sue C', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Neel, Michael D', 'Bowman, W Paul', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Metzger, Monika L', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Campbell, Patrick', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Downing, James R', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Howard, Scott C']","['Kaste SC', 'Pei D', 'Cheng C', 'Neel MD', 'Bowman WP', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Metzger ML', 'Bhojwani D', 'Inaba H', 'Campbell P', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Jeha S', 'Sandlund JT', 'Downing JR', 'Relling MV', 'Pui CH', 'Howard SC']","[""Sue C.

Recent evidence suggests that human gzmB primarily induces apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway by either cleaving Bid or activating Bim leading to the activation of Bak/Bax and subsequent generation of active caspase-3. In contrast, mouse gzmB is thought to predominantly induce apoptosis by directly processing pro-caspase-3. However, in certain mouse cell types gzmB-mediated apoptosis mainly occurs via the mitochondrial pathway. To investigate whether Bim is involved under the latter conditions, we have now employed ex vivo virus-immune mouse Tc that selectively kill by using perforin and gzmB (gzmB(+)Tc) as effector cells and wild type as well as Bim- or Bak/Bax-deficient spontaneously (3T9) or virus-(SV40) transformed mouse embryonic fibroblast cells as targets. We show that gzmB(+)Tc-mediated apoptosis (phosphatidylserine translocation, mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation) was severely reduced in 3T9 cells lacking either Bim or both Bak and Bax. This outcome was related to the ability of Tc cells to induce the degradation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL, the anti-apoptotic counterparts of Bim. In contrast, gzmB(+)Tc-mediated apoptosis was not affected in SV40-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblast cells lacking Bak/Bax. The data provide evidence that Bim participates in mouse gzmB(+)Tc-mediated apoptosis of certain targets by activating the mitochondrial pathway and suggest that the mode of cell death depends on the target cell. Our results suggest that the various molecular events leading to transformation and/or immortalization of cells have an impact on their relative resistance to the multiple gzmB(+)Tc-induced death pathways.","['Catalan, Elena', 'Jaime-Sanchez, Paula', 'Aguilo, Nacho', 'Simon, Markus M', 'Froelich, Christopher J', 'Pardo, Julian']","['Catalan E', 'Jaime-Sanchez P', 'Aguilo N', 'Simon MM', 'Froelich CJ', 'Pardo J']","['From the Departamento Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Biomedical Research Centre of Aragon, IIS Aragon, and.', 'From the Departamento Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Biomedical Research Centre of Aragon, IIS Aragon, and.', 'Departamento Microbiologia, Medicina Preventiva y Salud Publica, Universidad de Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.', 'the Metschnikoff Laboratory, Max-Planck-Institute for Immunology and Epigenetics, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.', 'the NorthShore University Health Systems Research Institute, University of Chicago, Evanston, Illinois 60201.', 'From the Departamento Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Biomedical Research Centre of Aragon, IIS Aragon, and Departamento Microbiologia, Medicina Preventiva y Salud Publica, Universidad de Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain, the Nanoscience Institute of Aragon, University of Zaragoza, 50015 Zaragoza, Spain, and the Aragon I+D Foundation, 50015 Zaragoza, Spain pardojim@unizar.es.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150120,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Caspase 3/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Granzymes/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*immunology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/immunology/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins/immunology', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*enzymology/immunology']",PMC4358112,,2015/01/22 06:00,2015/05/30 06:00,['2015/01/22 06:00'],"['2015/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)76766-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.631564 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Mar 13;290(11):6868-77. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.631564.

However for the more common metastatic malignancies chemotherapy treatment frequently brings clinical benefits but cure is not expected. Clinically this clear divide in outcome between the tumour types can appear at odds with the classical theories of chemotherapy sensitivity and resistance that include rates of proliferation, genetic development of drug resistance and drug efflux pumps. We have looked at the clinical characteristics of the chemotherapy curable malignancies to see if they have any common factors that could explain this extreme differential sensitivity to chemotherapy. DISCUSSION: It has previously been noted how the onset of malignancy can leave malignant cells fixed with some key cellular functions remaining frozen at the point in development at which malignant transformation occurred. In the chemotherapy curable malignancies the onset of malignancy is in each case closely linked to one of the unique genetic events of; nuclear fusion for molar pregnancies, choriocarcinoma and placental site trophoblast tumours, gastrulation for the childhood cancers, meiosis for testicular cancer and ovarian germ cell tumours and VDJ rearrangement and somatic hypermutation for acute leukemia and lymphoma. These processes are all linked to natural periods of supra-physiological apoptotic potential and it appears that the malignant cells arising from them usually retain this heightened sensitivity to DNA damage. To investigate this hypothesis we have examined the natural history of the healthy cells during these processes and the chemotherapy sensitivity of malignancies arising before, during and after the events. To add to the debate on chemotherapy resistance and sensitivity, we would argue that malignancies can be functionally divided into 2 groups. Firstly those that arise in cells with naturally heightened apoptotic potential as a result of their proximity to the unique genetic events, where the malignancies are generally chemotherapy curable and then the more common malignancies that arise in cells of standard apoptotic potential that are not curable with classical cytotoxic drugs.","['Savage, Philip']",['Savage P'],"['BCCA Vancouver Island, 2410 Lee Avenue, Victoria, BC, V8R 6V5, Canada. savage13561@msn.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150121,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', '*DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology']",PMC4308945,,2015/01/22 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/01/22 06:00'],"['2014/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-015-1006-6 [doi]', 's12885-015-1006-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2015 Jan 21;15:11. doi: 10.1186/s12885-015-1006-6.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we retrospectively assessed the efficacy of allo-SCT for MPAL. Eighteen patients with MPAL were identified from the transplant outcome database of Kanto Study Group for Cell Therapy (KSGCT). We also selected 215 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as control cohorts using an optimal matching method. The 5-yr overall survival (OS) rate of patients with MPAL was 48.1%, and patients in remission at the time of transplant showed significantly better survival than those not in remission (5-yr OS: 71.8% vs. 0%, P = 0.001). No significant differences were seen in OS when stratifying patients according to immunophenotype, cytogenetic abnormalities, or the type of induction therapy. The 5-yr OS rate of patients with MPAL was not significantly different compared with AML control patients (48.1% vs. 48.1%; P = 0.855) or ALL control patients (48.1% vs. 37.8%; P = 0.426).

A variety of different terms and classification systems have been used historically to describe this entity. MPAL is currently defined by a limited set of lineage-specific markers proposed in the 2008 World Health Organization monograph on classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. In adult patients, MPAL is characterized by relative therapeutic resistance that may be attributed in part to the high proportion of patients with adverse cytogenetic abnormalities.

In this study, we report the role of wild-type MOZ in regulating B-cell progenitor proliferation and hematopoietic malignancy. In the Emu-Myc model of aggressive pre-B/B-cell lymphoma, the loss of just one allele of Moz increased the median survival of mice by 3.9-fold. MOZ was required to maintain the proliferative capacity of B-cell progenitors, even in the presence of c-MYC overexpression, by directly maintaining the transcriptional activity of genes required for normal B-cell development. Hence, B-cell progenitor numbers were significantly reduced in Moz haploinsufficient animals. Interestingly, we find a significant overlap in genes regulated by MOZ, mixed lineage leukemia 1, and mixed lineage leukemia 1 cofactor menin. This includes Meis1, a TALE class homeobox transcription factor required for B-cell development, characteristically upregulated as a result of MLL1 translocations in leukemia. We demonstrate that MOZ localizes to the Meis1 locus in pre-B-cells and maintains Meis1 expression. Our results suggest that even partial inhibition of MOZ may reduce the proliferative capacity of MEIS1, and HOX-driven lymphoma and leukemia cells.","['Sheikh, Bilal N', 'Lee, Stanley C W', 'El-Saafin, Farrah', 'Vanyai, Hannah K', 'Hu, Yifang', 'Pang, Swee Heng Milon', 'Grabow, Stephanie', 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Nutt, Stephen L', 'Alexander, Warren S', 'Smyth, Gordon K', 'Voss, Anne K', 'Thomas, Tim']","['Sheikh BN', 'Lee SC', 'El-Saafin F', 'Vanyai HK', 'Hu Y', 'Pang SH', 'Grabow S', 'Strasser A', 'Nutt SL', 'Alexander WS', 'Smyth GK', 'Voss AK', 'Thomas T']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; and Department of Medical Biology, and.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; and Department of Medical Biology, and.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; and Department of Medical Biology, and.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; and Department of Medical Biology, and.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; and.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; and Department of Medical Biology, and.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; and Department of Medical Biology, and.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; and Department of Medical Biology, and.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; and Department of Medical Biology, and.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; and Department of Medical Biology, and.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; and Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; and Department of Medical Biology, and.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; and Department of Medical Biology, and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150120,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Haploinsufficiency', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC4440887,,2015/01/22 06:00,2015/05/27 06:00,['2015/01/22 06:00'],"['2015/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31891-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-08-594655 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Mar 19;125(12):1910-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-08-594655.

Although many cell-autonomous disease drivers are known, niche-dependent signaling in the context of the genetic disease heterogeneity has been difficult to investigate. Here, we analyzed the role of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) in AML. BTK was frequently expressed, and its inhibition strongly impaired the proliferation and survival of AML cells also in the presence of bone marrow stroma. By interactome analysis, (phospho)proteomics, and transcriptome sequencing, we characterized BTK signaling networks. We show that BTK-dependent signaling is highly context dependent. In Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD)-positive AML, BTK mediates FLT3-ITD-dependent Myc and STAT5 activation, and combined targeting of FLT3-ITD and BTK showed additive effects. In Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD)-negative AML, BTK couples Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) activation to nuclear factor kappaBeta and STAT5. Both BTK-dependent transcriptional programs were relevant for cell cycle progression and apoptosis regulation. Thus, we identify context-dependent oncogenic driver events that may guide subtype-specific treatment strategies and, for the first time, point to a role of TLR9 in AML. Clinical evaluation of BTK inhibitors in AML seems warranted.","['Oellerich, Thomas', 'Mohr, Sebastian', 'Corso, Jasmin', 'Beck, Julia', 'Dobele, Carmen', 'Braun, Helene', 'Cremer, Anjali', 'Munch, Silvia', 'Wicht, Johannes', 'Oellerich, Mark F', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Bohnenberger, Hanibal', 'Perske, Christina', 'Schutz, Ekkehard', 'Urlaub, Henning', 'Serve, Hubert']","['Oellerich T', 'Mohr S', 'Corso J', 'Beck J', 'Dobele C', 'Braun H', 'Cremer A', 'Munch S', 'Wicht J', 'Oellerich MF', 'Bug G', 'Bohnenberger H', 'Perske C', 'Schutz E', 'Urlaub H', 'Serve H']","['Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany;', 'Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Group, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen, Germany;', 'Chronix Biomedical, San Jose, CA;', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany;', 'German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany;', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany;', 'German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;', 'Department of Medicine III, Cardiology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany; and.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany;', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Chronix Biomedical, San Jose, CA;', 'Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Group, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen, Germany; Bioanalytics, Georg August University, Gottingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany; German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany;']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150120,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/chemistry', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",,,2015/01/22 06:00,2015/05/27 06:00,['2015/01/22 06:00'],"['2015/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31894-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-06-585216 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Mar 19;125(12):1936-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-06-585216.

Proposed treatment modalities applicable in preemptive cytoreduction (e.g., demethylating agents or standard chemotherapy) differ substantially in interval from administration to antileukemic effect. The t(6;9) balanced translocation, producing the DEK-NUP214 fusion protein, is seen in only 1% of patients with AML. We hypothesized that in these patients, who relapse with a very high frequency, a more detailed knowledge of leukemic relapse growth kinetics would improve the personalized decision-making regarding re-administration of chemotherapy. Based on standardized quantitative PCR data, we therefore delineated the relapse kinetics in a cohort of 27 relapsing DEK-NUP214-positive patients treated in four different European countries. The prerelapse leukemic burden increased with a median doubling time of 13 d (range: 5-51 d, median: 0.71 logs/month, range: 0.18-1.91 logs/month), with FLT3-ITD-positive patients relapsing significantly faster than FLT3-ITD-negative ones (median: 0.9 vs. 0.6 logs/month, Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.041). Peripheral blood and bone marrow were equally useful for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection, and thus, we found that with sampling intervals of 2 months, 94% of relapses would be detected with a median time from MRD detection to hematological relapse of 64 d. In conclusion, this data provide algorithms for handling the rare patients with DEK-NUP214-positive AML allowing for planning of both MRD follow-up and, upon molecular relapse, the timing of cytoreduction or possibly transplant procedures.","['Ommen, Hans B', 'Touzart, Aurore', 'MacIntyre, Elisabeth', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Tobal, Khalid', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Schnittger, Susanne']","['Ommen HB', 'Touzart A', 'MacIntyre E', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach T', 'Haferlach C', 'Tobal K', 'Hokland P', 'Schnittger S']","['Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology and CNRS UMR 8147, Hopital Necker-Enfants-Malades, AP-HP, Universite Paris 5 Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology and CNRS UMR 8147, Hopital Necker-Enfants-Malades, AP-HP, Universite Paris 5 Descartes, Paris, France.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', ""Molecular Oncology Unit, Guy's Hospital, London, UK."", 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20150313,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Algorithms', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', '*Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2015/01/22 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2015/01/22 06:00'],"['2014/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12511 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Nov;95(5):436-41. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12511.

This study shows that ERp57 contributes to radioresistance of laryngeal cancer by activating STAT3. Increased ERp57 was associated with the radioresistant phenotype of laryngeal cancer cells. Interestingly, increased interaction between ERp57 and STAT3 was observed in radioresistant cells, compared to the control cells. This physical complex is required for the activation of STAT3 in the radioresistant cells. Among STAT3-regulatory genes, Mcl-1 was predominantly regulated by ERp57. Inhibition of STAT3 activity with a chemical inhibitor or siRNA-mediated depletion of Mcl-1 sensitized radioresistant cells to irradiation, suggesting that the ERp57-STAT3-Mcl-1 axis regulates radioresistance of laryngeal cancer cells. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between ERp57 and phosphorylated STAT3 or Mcl-1 and in vivo interactions between ERp57 and STAT3 in human laryngeal cancer. Importantly, we also found that increased ERp57-STAT3 complex was associated with poor prognosis in human laryngeal cancer, indicating the prognostic role of ERp57-STAT3 regulation.

We now characterized the biological context of CXXC5 expression in primary human AML cells. The global gene expression profile of AML cells derived from 48 consecutive patients was analyzed; cells with high and low CXXC5 expression then showed major differences with regard to extracellular communication and intracellular signaling. We observed significant differences in the phosphorylation status of several intracellular signaling mediators (CREB, PDK1, SRC, STAT1, p38, STAT3, rpS6) that are important for PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling and/or transcriptional regulation. High CXXC5 expression was also associated with high mRNA expression of several stem cell-associated transcriptional regulators, the strongest associations being with WT1, GATA2, RUNX1, LYL1, DNMT3, SPI1, and MYB. Finally, CXXC5 knockdown in human AML cell lines caused significantly increased expression of the potential tumor suppressor gene TSC22 and genes encoding the growth factor receptor KIT, the cytokine Angiopoietin 1 and the selenium-containing glycoprotein Selenoprotein P. Thus, high CXXC5 expression seems to affect several steps in human leukemogenesis, including intracellular events as well as extracellular communication.","['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Fredly, Hanne', 'Skavland, Jorn', 'Hagen, Karen-Marie', 'van Hoang, Tuyen Thy', 'Brenner, Annette K', 'Kadi, Amir', 'Astori, Audrey', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Pendino, Frederic']","['Bruserud O', 'Reikvam H', 'Fredly H', 'Skavland J', 'Hagen KM', 'van Hoang TT', 'Brenner AK', 'Kadi A', 'Astori A', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Pendino F']","['Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Norway.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Norway.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Norway.', 'Inserm, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Inserm, U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Prognosis', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC4413618,,2015/01/22 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/22 06:00'],"['2014/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['3056 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3056 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Feb 20;6(5):2794-811. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3056.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CXXC5 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This unique property has been extensively studied on the intracellular, transcriptional level. However, ESCs typically form clusters of cells with distinct size and shape, and establish spatial structures that are vital for the maintenance of pluripotency. Even though it is recognized that the cells' arrangement and local interactions play a role in fate decision processes, the relations between transcriptional and spatial patterns have not yet been studied. We present a systems biology approach which combines live-cell imaging, quantitative image analysis, and multiscale, mathematical modeling of ESC growth. In particular, we develop quantitative measures of the morphology and of the spatial clustering of ESCs with different expression levels and apply them to images of both in vitro and in silico cultures. Using the same measures, we are able to compare model scenarios with different assumptions on cell-cell adhesions and intercellular feedback mechanisms directly with experimental data. Applying our methodology to microscopy images of cultured ESCs, we demonstrate that the emerging colonies are highly variable regarding both morphological and spatial fluorescence patterns. Moreover, we can show that most ESC colonies contain only one cluster of cells with high self-renewing capacity. These cells are preferentially located in the interior of a colony structure. The integrated approach combining image analysis with mathematical modeling allows us to reveal potential transcription factor related cellular and intercellular mechanisms behind the emergence of observed patterns that cannot be derived from images directly.","['Herberg, Maria', 'Zerjatke, Thomas', 'de Back, Walter', 'Glauche, Ingmar', 'Roeder, Ingo']","['Herberg M', 'Zerjatke T', 'de Back W', 'Glauche I', 'Roeder I']","['Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Center for Information Services and High Performance Computing, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Faculty of Medicine Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150120,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

In mice, several models of MC-deficiency have been developed. However, no comparable human model is available. We examined the in vitro- and in vivo effects of the KIT-targeting drug imatinib on growth and development of human MC. Imatinib was found to inhibit stem cell factor (SCF)-induced differentiation of MC in long-term suspension cultures (IC50: 0.01 microM). Correspondingly, long-term treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with imatinib (400 mg/day) resulted in a marked decrease in MC. In patients with continuous complete molecular response during therapy, bone marrow MC decreased to less than 5% of pre-treatment values, and also serum tryptase concentrations decreased significantly (pre-treatment: 32.0 +/- 11.1 ng/ml; post-therapy: 3.4 +/- 1.8, p<0.01). Other myeloid lineages, known to develop independently of KIT, were not affected by imatinib-therapy. Imatinib also produced a substantial decrease in MC-development in mice. However, no clinical syndrome attributable to drug-induced MC-deficiency was recorded in our CML patients. Together, imatinib suppresses MC production in vitro and in vivo. However, drug-induced MC depletion is not accompanied by adverse clinical events, suggesting that MC are less relevant to homeostasis in healthy tissues than we assumed so far.","['Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine', 'Rabenhorst, Anja', 'Stefanzl, Gabriele', 'Herndlhofer, Susanne', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Mullauer, Leonhard', 'Baumgartner, Sigrid', 'Beham-Schmid, Christine', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Mannhalter, Christine', 'Sill, Heinz', 'Linkesch, Werner', 'Arock, Michel', 'Hartmann, Karin', 'Valent, Peter']","['Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Rabenhorst A', 'Stefanzl G', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Hoermann G', 'Mullauer L', 'Baumgartner S', 'Beham-Schmid C', 'Sperr WR', 'Mannhalter C', 'Sill H', 'Linkesch W', 'Arock M', 'Hartmann K', 'Valent P']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Graz, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Austria.', 'LBPA CNRS UMR8113, Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan, Cachan, France.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/immunology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tryptases/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4413638,,2015/01/22 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/22 06:00'],"['2014/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['3074 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3074 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Feb 20;6(5):3071-84. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3074.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The FcCBs' redox behavior is examined in a wide pH range, and square wave voltammetry revealed the reversible and irreversible nature of first and second anodic peaks. The obvious shifts in peak potentials corresponding with the change of pH values demonstrate the abstraction of electrons to be accompanied with the transfer of protons.

While different cancers may have various propensities to migrate towards specific locations, they are all linked by this unifying principal. Unlike most neoplasms, leukaemia has inherent cell motility as leukocytes are required to move throughout the vascular system, suggesting that no mutations are required for anchorage independent growth. As such, it seems likely that leukaemias are inherently metastatic, endowed with the deadliest phenotype of cancer simply due to cell of origin. This article presents the biology of metastasis development and how leukaemia cells are inherently provided these phenotypic characteristics. It is then proposed how clinicians may be able to exploit the motility of leukaemia and metastatic emboli of other cancer types through an approach known as sonodynamic therapy (SDT), a treatment modality that combines chemotherapeutic agents with ultrasound to preferentially damage malignant cells. As experimental evidence has indicated, SDT is a promising therapeutic approach in need of clinical testing for further validation.","['Trendowski, Matthew']",['Trendowski M'],"['Department of Biology, Syracuse University, 107 College Place, Syracuse, NY 13244, USA.

Among these adverse sequelae are altered body composition, especially obesity, and compromised bone health in the form of osteoporosis and increased fragility. These outcomes are potentially reversible and even preventable. This study will examine measures of body composition and bone health in long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in childhood and adolescence. These measures will be complemented by measures of physical activity and health-related quality of life (HRQL). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Survivors of ALL who are at least 10 years from diagnosis, following treatment on uniform protocols, will undergo measurements of body mass index; triceps skin fold thickness and mid-upper arm circumference; fat mass, lean body mass, skeletal muscle mass and bone mineral density by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; trabecular and cortical bone indices and muscle density by peripheral quantitative CT; physical activity by the Habitual Activity Estimation Scale; and HRQL by Health Utilities Index instruments. Descriptive measures will be used for continuous variables and number (percent) for categorical variables. Associations between variables will be assessed using Fisher's exact t test and the chi(2) test; correlations will be tested by the Pearson correlation coefficient. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study is approved by the institutional research ethics board and is supported by a competitive funding award. Dissemination of the results will occur by presentations to scientific meetings and publications in peer-reviewed journals, and by posting summaries of the results on websites accessed by adolescent and young adult survivors of cancer.","['Barr, Ronald', 'Nayiager, Trishana', 'Gordon, Christopher', 'Marriott, Christopher', 'Athale, Uma']","['Barr R', 'Nayiager T', 'Gordon C', 'Marriott C', 'Athale U']","[""Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada Division of Hematology-Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", ""Division of Hematology-Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada Department of Radiology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', ""Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada Division of Hematology-Oncology, McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150120,England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Body Composition', 'Body Mass Index', '*Bone Density', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Exercise', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Regression Analysis', 'Skinfold Thickness', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",PMC4305072,,2015/01/22 06:00,2015/09/04 06:00,['2015/01/22 06:00'],"['2015/01/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2014-006191 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006191 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2015 Jan 20;5(1):e006191. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006191.,,,,"['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The therapeutic efficacy (e.g., chemoresistance) and adverse effects of asparaginase (e.g., hypersensivity and pancreatitis) have been investigated over the past four decades. It was suggested early on that leukemic cells are resistant to asparaginase because of their increased asparagine synthetase activity. Afterward, other mechanisms associated with asparaginase resistance were reported. Not only leukemic cells but also patients themselves may play a role in causing asparaginase resistance, which has been associated with unfavorable outcome in children with ALL. This article will briefly review asparaginase therapy in children with ALL and comprehensively analyze recent reports on the potential mechanisms of asparaginase resistance.","['Chen, Shih-Hsiang']",['Chen SH'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, 5 Fu-Shin Street, Kwei-Shan 333, Taoyuan, Taiwan.

AML in older patients is more often associated with biologically unfavorable features, and these patients are less likely to tolerate or accept intensive therapy. There have not been substantial improvements in outcome for this group of patients despite decades of research. In this review, we summarize the most substantial contributions in the past 2 years. RECENT FINDINGS: There have been three major research themes in the recently published literature for older patients with AML: methods to predict response to therapy, models to predict toxicity of therapy in older, less-fit patients, and investigation of novel agents for AML patients with either newly diagnosed or relapsed disease. An unexpected recent finding has been the observation that complete remission in this disease may not necessarily translate into an overall survival advantage, and conversely, survival benefit has been demonstrated without any improvement in complete remission. SUMMARY: Although anthracycline and cytarabine-based therapy remains the standard of care for older patients with AML, this option remains suboptimal for the vast majority of patients. We argue for a national research agenda that may help to accelerate progress for older people with AML.","['Michaelis, Laura C', 'Erba, Harry P']","['Michaelis LC', 'Erba HP']","['aDivision of Hematology/Oncology, The Medical College of Wisconsin/Froedtert Hospital, Milwaukee, Wisconsin bDivision of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Geriatric Assessment', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2015/01/21 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,['2015/01/21 06:00'],"['2015/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000120 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2015 Mar;22(2):108-15. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000120.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood monocyte cells were collected from nonsmokers (n = 17), non-CAD (NCAD) smokers (n = 35), and CAD smokers (n = 32) before and after 3 months of smoking cessation. We found that the ABCA1 expression level was lower in macrophages from NCAD and CAD smokers than from nonsmokers at baseline. The ABCA1 function of mediating cholesterol efflux was reduced in NCAD and CAD smokers as compared with nonsmokers. After 3 months of smoking cessation, ABCA1 expression and function were improved in CAD smokers. However, ABCG1 expression and function did not change after smoking cessation. Furthermore, ABCA1 expression was inhibited by tar in human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1-derived macrophages through the inhibition of liver X receptors. Nicotine and carbon monoxide did not inhibit ABCA1 expression. Our results indicate that chronic cigarette smoking impaired ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in macrophages and that tobacco abstinence reversed the function and expression of ABCA1, especially in CAD patients. It was tobacco tar, rather than nicotine or carbon monoxide, that played a major role in the tobacco-induced disturbance of cellular cholesterol homeostasis.","['Song, Wei', 'Wang, Wei', 'Dou, Li-Yang', 'Wang, Yu', 'Xu, Yan', 'Chen, Lian-Feng', 'Yan, Xiao-Wei']","['Song W', 'Wang W', 'Dou LY', 'Wang Y', 'Xu Y', 'Chen LF', 'Yan XW']","['Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) Hospital, PUMC and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) Hospital, PUMC and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) Hospital, PUMC and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) Hospital, PUMC and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) Hospital, PUMC and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) Hospital, PUMC and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Peking Union Medical College (PUMC) Hospital, PUMC and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.

How TET2, like most other chromatin-modifying enzymes, is recruited to specific genomic sites is unknown. Here we report that WT1, a sequence-specific transcription factor, is mutated in a mutually exclusive manner with TET2, IDH1, and IDH2 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). WT1 physically interacts with and recruits TET2 to its target genes to activate their expression. The interaction between WT1 and TET2 is disrupted by multiple AML-derived TET2 mutations. TET2 suppresses leukemia cell proliferation and colony formation in a manner dependent on WT1. These results provide a mechanism for targeting TET2 to a specific DNA sequence in the genome. Our results also provide an explanation for the mutual exclusivity of WT1 and TET2 mutations in AML, and suggest an IDH1/2-TET2-WT1 pathway in suppressing AML.","['Wang, Yiping', 'Xiao, Mengtao', 'Chen, Xiufei', 'Chen, Leilei', 'Xu, Yanping', 'Lv, Lei', 'Wang, Pu', 'Yang, Hui', 'Ma, Shenghong', 'Lin, Huaipeng', 'Jiao, Bo', 'Ren, Ruibao', 'Ye, Dan', 'Guan, Kun-Liang', 'Xiong, Yue']","['Wang Y', 'Xiao M', 'Chen X', 'Chen L', 'Xu Y', 'Lv L', 'Wang P', 'Yang H', 'Ma S', 'Lin H', 'Jiao B', 'Ren R', 'Ye D', 'Guan KL', 'Xiong Y']","['State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China; Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, RuiJin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center for Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.

One hundred and ten untreated unfit AML patients received front-line azacitidine therapy in Spain, and response and survival were evaluated in them following European LeukemiaNet (ELN) guidelines. A clinical prediction rule was obtained from this population that was validated and refined in 261 patients treated in France, Austria and Italy. ELN response was achieved in 21.0% of the 371 patients (CI95% 17.0-25.5) and did not depend on bone marrow blast cell percentage. Median overall survival was 9.6 months (CI95% 8.5-10.8) and 40.6% of the patients were alive at 1 year (CI95% 35.5-45.7).

Mutations of PHF6 are found in patients with Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or acute myeloid leukemia. Recently, PHF6 was identified to interact with the NuRD complex, and this interaction is mediated by the RBBP4 component. However, little is known about the molecular basis for the interaction. Here, we present the crystal structure of the complex of the NuRD subunit RBBP4 bound to the PHF6 peptide (residues 162-170). The PHF6 peptide binds to the top surface of the RBBP4 beta-propeller. A pair of positively charged residues of the PHF6 peptide insert into the negatively charged pocket of RBBP4, which is critical for the interaction between PHF6 and RBBP4. Corresponding PHF6 mutants impair this interaction in vitro and in vivo. Structural comparison shows that the PHF6-binding pocket overlaps with FOG1 and histone H3 on RBBP4/Nurf55, but it is distinct from the pocket recognizing histone H4, Su(z)12, and MTA1. We further show that the middle disordered region (residues 145-207, containing the RBBP4-binding motif) is sufficient for the transcriptional repression mediated by PHF6 on the GAL4 reporter, and knockdown of RBBP4 diminished the PHF6-mediated repression. Our RBBP4-PHF6 complex structure provides insights into the molecular basis of PHF6-NuRD complex interaction and implicates a role for PHF6 in chromatin structure modulation and gene regulation.","['Liu, Zhonghua', 'Li, Fudong', 'Zhang, Beibei', 'Li, Sai', 'Wu, Jihui', 'Shi, Yunyu']","['Liu Z', 'Li F', 'Zhang B', 'Li S', 'Wu J', 'Shi Y']","['From the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China.', 'From the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China.', 'From the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China.', 'From the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China.', 'From the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China wujihui@ustc.edu.cn.', 'From the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale and School of Life Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230027, China yyshi@ustc.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150119,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Peptides/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 4/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC4358295,,2015/01/21 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2015/01/21 06:00'],"['2015/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)46798-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.610196 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Mar 6;290(10):6630-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.610196.

In intact cells, fluorimetric measurements of [Ca(2+)]i following thapsigargin-mediated activation of CRAC entry revealed a sustained increase in [Ca(2+)]i. Block of KCa3.1 by application of charybdotoxin resulted in a 50% reduction in the steady-state [Ca(2+)]i, consistent with the well established role for KCa3.1-mediated hyperpolarisation in augmenting CRAC entry. Interestingly, subsequent depolarisation to 0mV by application of gramicidin resulted in a fall in steady-state Ca(2+) levels to values theoretically below that required for activation of KCa3.1. Whole cell patch clamp experiments confirmed the lack of KCa3.1 activation at 0mV following activation of the CRAC entry pathway, indicating an absolute requirement for a hyperpolarised resting membrane potential for the initial activation of KCa3.1 leading to hyperpolarisation and augmented Ca(2+) entry. Current clamp experiments confirmed the requirement for a hyperpolarised resting membrane potential in KCa3.1 activation by CRAC entry. Given the critical role played by KCa3.1 and membrane potential in general in the control of CRAC-mediated [Ca(2+)]i changes, we investigated the hypothesis that inhibition of the CRAC-mediated changes in [Ca(2+)]i observed following 2-APB addition may in part arise from direct inhibition of KCa3.1 by 2-APB. Under whole cell patch clamp, 2-APB, at concentrations typically used to block the CRAC channel, potently inhibited KCa3.1 in a reversible manner (half maximal inhibition 14.2 muM). This block was accompanied by a marked shift in the reversal potential to depolarised values approaching that set by endogenous membrane conductances. At the single channel level, 2-APB applied to the cytosolic face resulted in a significant reduction in open channel probability and a fall in the mean open time of the residual channel activity. Our data highlight the absolute requirement for a hyperpolarising resting membrane conductance for the initial activation of KCa3.1 by CRAC entry. Additionally, our results document direct inhibition of KCa3.1 by 2-APB, thus highlighting the need for caution when ascribing the site of inhibition of 2-APB exclusively to the CRAC entry pathway in experiments where membrane potential is not controlled.","['Littlechild, Robert', 'Zaidman, Nathalie', 'Khodaverdi, Darren', 'Mason, Michael James']","['Littlechild R', 'Zaidman N', 'Khodaverdi D', 'Mason MJ']","['Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, CB2 3EG Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, CB2 3EG Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, CB2 3EG Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, CB2 3EG Cambridge, UK.

But often, especially in clinical settings, the cytometer cannot measure all the desired markers in a single aliquot. In these cases, tissue is separated into independently analysed samples, leaving a need to electronically recombine these to increase dimensionality. Nearest-neighbour (NN) based imputation fulfils this need but can produce artificial subpopulations. Clustering-based NNs can reduce these, but requires prior domain knowledge to be able to parameterize the clustering, so is unsuited to discovery settings. RESULTS: We present flowBin, a parameterization-free method for combining multitube FCM data into a higher-dimensional form suitable for deep profiling and discovery. FlowBin allocates cells to bins defined by the common markers across tubes in a multitube experiment, then computes aggregate expression for each bin within each tube, to create a matrix of expression of all markers assayed in each tube. We show, using simulated multitube data, that flowType analysis of flowBin output reproduces the results of that same analysis on the original data for cell types of >10% abundance. We used flowBin in conjunction with classifiers to distinguish normal from cancerous cells. We used flowBin together with flowType and RchyOptimyx to profile the immunophenotypic landscape of NPM1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia, and present a series of novel cell types associated with that mutation.","[""O'Neill, Kieran"", 'Aghaeepour, Nima', 'Parker, Jeremy', 'Hogge, Donna', 'Karsan, Aly', 'Dalal, Bakul', 'Brinkman, Ryan R']","[""O'Neill K"", 'Aghaeepour N', 'Parker J', 'Hogge D', 'Karsan A', 'Dalal B', 'Brinkman RR']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Bioinformatics Graduate Program, University of British Columbia, Department of Hematopathology, Vancouver General Hospital and Faculty of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Bioinformatics Graduate Program, University of British Columbia, Department of Hematopathology, Vancouver General Hospital and Faculty of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Bioinformatics Graduate Program, University of British Columbia, Department of Hematopathology, Vancouver General Hospital and Faculty of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Bioinformatics Graduate Program, University of British Columbia, Department of Hematopathology, Vancouver General Hospital and Faculty of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Bioinformatics Graduate Program, University of British Columbia, Department of Hematopathology, Vancouver General Hospital and Faculty of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Bioinformatics Graduate Program, University of British Columbia, Department of Hematopathology, Vancouver General Hospital and Faculty of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Bioinformatics Graduate Program, University of British Columbia, Department of Hematopathology, Vancouver General Hospital and Faculty of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Bioinformatics Graduate Program, University of British Columbia, Department of Hematopathology, Vancouver General Hospital and Faculty of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Bioinformatics Graduate Program, University of British Columbia, Department of Hematopathology, Vancouver General Hospital and Faculty of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['R01 EB008400/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01EB008400/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150118,England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', '*Software']",PMC4426837,,2015/01/21 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2015/01/21 06:00'],"['2014/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['btv008 [pii]', '10.1093/bioinformatics/btv008 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2015 May 15;31(10):1623-31. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv008.

We aimed at a characterization of patients with different types of cellularity. METHODS: We assessed marrow cellularity both by histology and cytology in 1270 patients and analyzed hematologic, cytogenetic, and prognostic parameters accordingly. RESULTS: The concordance of the assessment of cellularity differed dramatically between histology and cytology as only 36.5% were described as hypocellular by both methods (P < 0.0005) (hypocellular 16.4%, normocellular 23.3%, hypercellular 60.3%). There were no major differences with regard to hematopoietic insufficiency. The presence of fibrosis was associated to hypercellular bone marrow. Median survival differed from 38 months in hypocellular, 42 months in normocellular, and 25 months in hypercellular MDS (P < 0.0005). AML progression rates were 33% for hypercellular MDS after 2 yr, whereas hypo- and normocellular had a progression rate of 19% after 2 yr (P = 0.018). IPSS and IPSS-R were able to identify different risk groups within all three cellularity groups. CONCLUSION: Based on our data, hypocellular patients obviously do not present as a separate entity, as there were no striking differences with regard to cytogenetics and WHO types. Assessment of cellularity should be performed by histopathology.","['Schemenau, Jennifer', 'Baldus, Stephan', 'Anlauf, Martin', 'Reinecke, Petra', 'Braunstein, Stefan', 'Blum, Sabine', 'Nachtkamp, Kathrin', 'Neukirchen, Judith', 'Strup, Corinna', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Germing, Ulrich']","['Schemenau J', 'Baldus S', 'Anlauf M', 'Reinecke P', 'Braunstein S', 'Blum S', 'Nachtkamp K', 'Neukirchen J', 'Strup C', 'Aul C', 'Haas R', 'Gattermann N', 'Germing U']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'St Johannes Hospital, Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, Duisburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",20150515,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/etiology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/diagnosis/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",,,2015/01/21 06:00,2016/05/06 06:00,['2015/01/21 06:00'],"['2014/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12512 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Sep;95(3):181-9. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12512.

With respect to hematopoiesis, TXNIP has been shown to play roles in natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and hematopoietic stem cells. Our study investigates the role of TXNIP in erythropoiesis. We observed a rapid and significant increase of TXNIP transcript and protein levels in mouse erythroleukemia cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide or hexamethylene bisacetamide, inducers of erythroid differentiation. The upregulation of TXNIP was not abrogated by addition of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. The increase of TXNIP expression was confirmed in another model of erythroid differentiation, G1E-ER cells, which undergo differentiation upon activation of the GATA1 transcription factor. In addition, we showed that TXNIP levels are induced following inhibition of p38 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases. We also observed an increase in iron uptake and a decrease in transferrin receptor protein upon TXNIP overexpression, suggesting a role in iron homeostasis. In vivo, flow cytometry analysis of cells from Txnip(-/-) mice revealed a new phenotype of impaired terminal erythropoiesis in the spleen, characterized by a partial block between basophilic and late basophilic/polychromatic erythroblasts.

MATERIAL/METHODS: We performed a computer search of relevant case-control studies published from January 1990 to Jan 2014 in databases such as Ovid, EBSCO, PubMed, CNKI, CBMDISC, VIP, and WanFang Data. The literature was screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data were retrieved, and the quality of the methodology used in the studies was evaluated. A meta-analysis was performed by calculating the combined odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using RevMan 5.0 and Stata 10.0 software. Sensitivity was analyzed and publication bias was assessed. RESULTS: A total of ten case-control studies from nine research papers were selected in this study, which included 1889 cases and 5707 controls. Meta-analysis showed that people who carried the G allele had increased susceptibility to leukemia compared to people who carried the T allele [OR=1.24, 95% CI (1.06, 1.45), P=0.007]. In a recessive model, the GG homozygotic population had a higher risk of leukemia than the heterozygotic GT+TT population [OR=1.47, 95% CI (1.11, 1.96), P=0.008]. We did not find significant difference in a dominant model [GG+GT vs. TT: OR=1.22, 95% CI (0.98, 1.52), P=0.07]. Publication bias was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: SNP309 polymorphism in the MDM2 gene is associated with susceptibility to leukemia. The G allele may be a risk factor for leukemia.","['Ou, Wen-Bin']",['Ou WB'],"['Out-Patient Department, Air Force General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20150116,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,IM,"['Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",PMC4306267,,2015/01/21 06:00,2015/10/30 06:00,['2015/01/21 06:00'],"['2015/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['892919 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.892919 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2015 Jan 16;21:213-8. doi: 10.12659/MSM.892919.,"['EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two of the four CRF patients with APL in the study were dialysis-dependent, and two had eGFRs of 18 and 19 mL/min/1.73 m(2) . ATO dosage schedules were adjusted to obtain comparable whole-blood arsenic levels to those in APL patients with normal renal function who achieved molecular remission (MR) while receiving 10 mg ATO daily for 28 d. RESULTS: Average ATO administered per day in CRF patients ranged from 36 to 50% of the ATO administered to APL patients with normal renal function. No clinically significant cardiac, hepatic or other toxicities were detected. RT-PCR-negative MR was achieved after one treatment course in two patients and after two courses in the others. Relapse-free survival is 155, 60, 43 and 5 months. CONCLUSION: The observations in this pilot study have demonstrated whole-blood arsenic levels can provide a guide to adjustments of ATO dosage schedules that permit safe and effective therapeutic outcomes in APL patients with severely compromised renal function.","['Firkin, Frank', 'Roncolato, Fernando', 'Ho, Wai Khoon']","['Firkin F', 'Roncolato F', 'Ho WK']","[""Department of Medicine, St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne University, Fitzroy, Vic., Australia."", 'Department of Haematology, St George Hospital, Kogarah, NSW, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Austin Hospital, Heidelberg, Vic., Australia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150323,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*complications/etiology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pilot Projects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2015/01/21 06:00,2016/06/18 06:00,['2015/01/21 06:00'],"['2014/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12502 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Oct;95(4):331-5. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12502.

Patients and methods Thirty-five patients received oral abexinostat 30, 45, or 60 mg/m(2) bid in a 3 + 3 design in three 21-day schedules: 14 days on treatment in schedule 1 (D1-14); 10 days in schedule 2 (D1-5 and D8-12); and 12 days in schedule 3 (D1-4, D8-11, and D15-18). Safety, tumour response, plasma concentration, and histone H3 acetylation were measured. Results Two dose-limiting toxicities occurred in each schedule (one grade 3 febrile neutropenia; five grade 4 thrombocytopenia) at 60 mg/m(2) bid (maximal tolerated dose). The recommended dose was 45 mg/m(2) bid; schedule 1 was considered optimal. Non-haematological drug-related toxicities included grade 1 or 2 diarrhoea (43%), nausea (23%), and vomiting (11%); haematological toxicities included thrombocytopenia (31% grade 3, and 26% grade 4), which remained manageable and reversible on withdrawal. Of 29 evaluable patients, there were 2 complete and 6 partial responses; median duration of response was 14.6 months (range 3-16.5 months) (1 cycle is equivalent to 0.75 months). There was no evidence for nonlinear pharmacokinetics. There was a correlation between dose and histone acetylation. Conclusion Abexinostat has manageable toxicity and induced some durable complete and partial responses in B-cell lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Our results suggest most favourable responses in patients with follicular lymphoma, though further research would be needed to confirm this finding.","['Morschhauser, Franck', 'Terriou, Louis', 'Coiffier, Bertrand', 'Bachy, Emmanuel', 'Varga, Andrea', 'Kloos, Ioana', 'Lelievre, Helene', 'Sarry, Anne-Laure', 'Depil, Stephane', 'Ribrag, Vincent']","['Morschhauser F', 'Terriou L', 'Coiffier B', 'Bachy E', 'Varga A', 'Kloos I', 'Lelievre H', 'Sarry AL', 'Depil S', 'Ribrag V']","['Centre Hospitalier Regional de Lille, Hopital Claude Huriez, Service des maladies du sang, Groupe de Recherche sur les formes Injectables et les Technologies Associees (GRITA), Universite de Lille, Lille, France, franck.morschhauser@chru-lille.fr.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",20150121,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Benzofurans/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged']",,,2015/01/21 06:00,2016/01/20 06:00,['2015/01/21 06:00'],"['2014/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-015-0206-x [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2015 Apr;33(2):423-31. doi: 10.1007/s10637-015-0206-x.

We analyzed RNA sequencing data from 179 primary AML samples and normal hematopoietic cells to understand the range of expression patterns in normal versus leukemic cells. HOX expression in AML was restricted to specific genes in the HOXA or HOXB loci, and was highly correlated with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities. However, the majority of samples expressed a canonical set of HOXA and HOXB genes that was nearly identical to the expression signature of normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Transcriptional profiles at the HOX loci were similar between normal cells and AML samples, and involved bidirectional transcription at the center of each gene cluster. Epigenetic analysis of a subset of AML samples also identified common regions of chromatin accessibility in AML samples and normal CD34(+) cells that displayed differences in methylation depending on HOX expression patterns. These data provide an integrated epigenetic view of the HOX gene loci in primary AML samples, and suggest that HOX expression in most AML samples represents a normal stem cell program that is controlled by epigenetic mechanisms at specific regulatory elements.","['Spencer, D H', 'Young, M A', 'Lamprecht, T L', 'Helton, N M', 'Fulton, R', ""O'Laughlin, M"", 'Fronick, C', 'Magrini, V', 'Demeter, R T', 'Miller, C A', 'Klco, J M', 'Wilson, R K', 'Ley, T J']","['Spencer DH', 'Young MA', 'Lamprecht TL', 'Helton NM', 'Fulton R', ""O'Laughlin M"", 'Fronick C', 'Magrini V', 'Demeter RT', 'Miller CA', 'Klco JM', 'Wilson RK', 'Ley TJ']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'The Genome Institute, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA.', '1] Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA [2] The Genome Institute, Washington University, St Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA162086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA171963-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL116605/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA171963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197561/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA91842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA162086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150120,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenomics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Homeobox/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate']",PMC4456213,['NIHMS669504'],2015/01/21 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/01/21 06:00'],"['2014/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20156 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.6 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jun;29(6):1279-89. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.6.

We aim to characterize the recent incidence and incidence-trend of childhood cancer in Taiwan after the National Health Insurance program was launched in March 1995. Data were extracted from the Taiwan Cancer Registry, a population-based database established in 1979. Cases diagnosed at age 0-14 from 1996 to 2010 were analyzed and categorized according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer, Third Edition (ICCC-3). In total, 8032 childhood cancer cases were included, with a microscopic verification rate of 93.9%. The overall age-standardized rate (ASR) of incidence adjusted to the 2000 World Standard Population is 125.0 cases/million, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.3. The top five cancer types (ICCC-3 subgroup[s]; ASR per million) are acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ia, 30.3), acute myeloid leukemia (Ib; 9.4), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (IIb,c,e, 9.0), extracranial germ cell tumor (Xb,c; 8.3), and neuroblastoma (IVa; 7.8). The median age of diagnosis was 6 years for both genders. During the study period, the ASR of childhood cancer has been increasing at a rate of 1.2% per year (95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.7%). In contrast to Western countries, China, Japan, and Taiwan have lower incidence of childhood cancer; however, Taiwan's incidence rates of childhood germ cell tumors and hepatic tumors are higher. In conclusion, this population-based study reveals that the incidence rate of childhood cancer in Taiwan is rising consistently. The high incidence of germ cell tumors warrants further investigation.","['Liu, Yen-Lin', 'Lo, Wei-Cheng', 'Chiang, Chun-Ju', 'Yang, Ya-Wen', 'Lu, Meng-Yao', 'Hsu, Wen-Ming', 'Ho, Wan-Ling', 'Li, Meng-Ju', 'Miser, James S', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn', 'Lai, Mei-Shu']","['Liu YL', 'Lo WC', 'Chiang CJ', 'Yang YW', 'Lu MY', 'Hsu WM', 'Ho WL', 'Li MJ', 'Miser JS', 'Lin DT', 'Lai MS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Taipei Medical University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; PhD of Translational Medicine Program, National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Taiwan Cancer Registry, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Taiwan Cancer Registry, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Taiwan Cancer Registry, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Surgery, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Pediatrics, Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University, Xinzhuang, New Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Hsin-Chu Branch, Hsinchu City, Taiwan.', 'College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

At the time, registries reviewed the long-term follow-up of their healthy donors, which suggested no excess of leukaemia in PBSC donors compared with BM donors. Although the evidence for an increased risk of malignancy in healthy donors was felt to be weak, it could not be excluded. The WMDA, therefore, issued a statement, to be included in all donor consent forms, stating that it was unknown whether G-CSF increased or decreased the risk of later developing cancer. In 2012, with 5 years of additional donor follow-up and the results of several genetic studies now available, the clinical working group of the WMDA again reviewed the data. On the basis of an assessment of a continuing lack of evidence for an increased risk of malignancy in donors receiving G-CSF, the WMDA has re-issued a more reassuring statement.

Nevertheless, relapse remains a major cause for post SCT mortality in patients with AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In this retrospective single-center analysis, we have analyzed the treatment outcomes of 108 patients with AML or MDS, who relapsed after Allo-SCT. Seventy of these patients (65%) were treated with salvage therapies containing chemotherapy alone, allogeneic cell-based treatment or the combination of both. Thirty-eight patients (35%) received palliative treatment. Median OS after diagnosis of relapse was 130 days. Compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone, response to salvage therapy was significantly improved in patients treated with a combination of chemo- and allogeneic cell-based therapy (CR rate 57% vs 13%, P=0.002). Among risk factors concerning pretreatment characteristics, disease status before first Allo-SCT, and details of transplantation, only the time interval from Allo-SCT to relapse was an independent predictor of response to salvage therapy and OS. These data confirmed that time to relapse after transplantation is an important prognostic factor.

IDH1- and IDH2-mutant primary human AML cells were more sensitive than IDH1/2 wild-type cells to ABT-199, a highly specific BCL-2 inhibitor that is currently in clinical trials for hematologic malignancies, both ex vivo and in xenotransplant models. This sensitization effect was induced by (R)-2-HG-mediated inhibition of the activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC); suppression of COX activity lowered the mitochondrial threshold to trigger apoptosis upon BCL-2 inhibition. Our findings indicate that IDH1/2 mutation status may identify patients that are likely to respond to pharmacologic BCL-2 inhibition and form the rational basis for combining agents that disrupt ETC activity with ABT-199 in future clinical studies.","['Chan, Steven M', 'Thomas, Daniel', 'Corces-Zimmerman, M Ryan', 'Xavy, Seethu', 'Rastogi, Suchita', 'Hong, Wan-Jen', 'Zhao, Feifei', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Tyvoll, David A', 'Majeti, Ravindra']","['Chan SM', 'Thomas D', 'Corces-Zimmerman MR', 'Xavy S', 'Rastogi S', 'Hong WJ', 'Zhao F', 'Medeiros BC', 'Tyvoll DA', 'Majeti R']","['1] Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.

We show that both pediatric and adult B-lineage lymphoid malignancies are characterized by a very high incidence of the CD22DeltaE12 genetic defect. We provide unprecedented experimental evidence for a previously unrecognized causal link between CD22DeltaE12 and aggressive biology of BPL cells by demonstrating that siRNA-mediated knockdown of CD22DeltaE12 in primary BPL cells is associated with a marked inhibition of their clonogenicity. These findings provide the preclinical proof-of-concept that siRNA-mediated depletion of CD22DeltaE12 may help develop effective treatments for high-risk and relapsed BPL patients who are in urgent need for therapeutic innovations. We also describe a unique polypeptide-based nanoparticle formulation of CD22DeltaE12-siRNA as an RNAi therapeutic candidate targeting CD22DeltaE12 that is capable of delivering its siRNA cargo into the cytoplasm of leukemia cells causing effective CD22DeltaE12 depletion and marked inhibition of leukemic cell growth. Further development and optimization of this nanoparticle or other nanoformulation platforms for CD22DeltaE12-siRNA may facilitate the development of an effective therapeutic RNAi strategy against paradigm shift in therapy of aggressive or chemotherapy-resistant B-lineage lymphoid malignancies.,"['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Qazi, Sanjive', 'Ma, Hong', 'Yin, Lichen', 'Cheng, Jianjun']","['Uckun FM', 'Qazi S', 'Ma H', 'Yin L', 'Cheng J']","[""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), Los Angeles, CA 90027 ; Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine (USC KSOM), Los Angeles, CA 90027 ; Translational Oncology Program, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine (USC KSOM), Los Angeles, CA 90027."", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), Los Angeles, CA 90027 ; Bioinformatics Program, Gustavus Adolphus College, 800 W College Avenue, St. Peter, MN 56082."", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), Los Angeles, CA 90027."", ""Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010; University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) Bioengineering Department, Urbana, IL 61801."", ""Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010; University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) Bioengineering Department, Urbana, IL 61801.""]",['eng'],"['DP2 OD007246/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA154471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA151837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,EBioMedicine,EBioMedicine,101647039,,,PMC4292938,['NIHMS644169'],2015/01/20 06:00,2015/01/20 06:01,['2015/01/20 06:00'],"['2015/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ebiom.2014.10.013 [doi]', 'S2352-3964(14)00015-2 [pii]']",ppublish,EBioMedicine. 2014 Dec;1(2-3):141-155. doi: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2014.10.013.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cationic polypeptides', 'leukemia', 'nanomedicine', 'nanoparticles', 'nanotechnology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

MiR-155 is a kind of molecule with different functions, such as its role in proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation, differentiation, and immunity. One of its best known functions is apoptosis that affects on caspase-3 activity. The main aim of this study was evaluation of miR-155 inhibition effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis induction in Jurkat cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, Jurkat cells along with MTT assay were used for evaluation of sensitivity to varied concentrations of miR-155 inhibitor (25, 50 and 75 nmol). MiR-155 expression level was analyzed using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Caspase-3 activity was measured by caspase-3 colorimetric activity assay kit. Unpaired t-test was applied for the analysis of MTT and apoptosis results. Probability of 5% was assumed as statistically significant. RESULTS: According to our results, the use of miR-155 inhibitor increased the activity of caspase-3 by 2 fold in 75 nmol concentration. In this research, we found that the proper increase of miR-155 inhibitor concentration can inhibit miR-155 and consequently increase caspase-3 activity and induce apoptosis in the Jurkat cells leading to cell death ultimately. CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis induction by miRNAs activation or inhibition is probably one of the best and low risk ways of cell death induction in malignancies. Due to role of miR-155 in several cancer cells, it may be used as a therapeutic target in future.","['Alizadeh, Sh', 'Kaviani, S', 'Soleimani, M', 'Abroun, S', 'Kashani-Khatib, Z', 'Asgharzadeh, A', 'Dargahi, H', 'Mousavi, R']","['Alizadeh Sh', 'Kaviani S', 'Soleimani M', 'Abroun S', 'Kashani-Khatib Z', 'Asgharzadeh A', 'Dargahi H', 'Mousavi R']","['Department of Hematology, Allied Medical School, Tehran University of Medical sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Mashad University of Medical sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Health care services, Medical School, Tehran University of Medical sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Allied Medical School, Tehran University of Medical sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141210,Iran,Iran J Ped Hematol Oncol,Iranian journal of pediatric hematology and oncology,101571320,,,PMC4293513,,2015/01/20 06:00,2015/01/20 06:01,['2015/01/20 06:00'],"['2014/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/20 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Ped Hematol Oncol. 2014;4(4):141-50.

Single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) substitutes rare earth elements for fluorophores to label antibodies, which allows measurements of up to 120 parameters in single cells without correction for spectral overlap. The aim of this study was the evaluation of intracellular signaling in antigen-defined stem/progenitor cell subsets in primary AML. CyTOF and conventional FCM yielded comparable results on LSC phenotypes defined by CD45, CD34, CD38, CD123, and CD99. Intracellular phosphoprotein responses to ex vivo cell signaling inhibitors and cytokine stimulation were assessed in myeloid leukemia cell lines and one primary AML sample. CyTOF and conventional FCM results were confirmed by western blotting. In the primary AML sample, we investigated the cell responses to ex vivo stimulation with stem cell factor and BEZ235-induced inhibition of PI3K and identified activation patterns in multiple PI3K downstream signaling pathways including p-4EBP1, p-AKT, and p-S6, particularly in CD34(+) subsets. We evaluated multiple signaling pathways in antigen-defined subpopulations in primary AML cells with FLT3-ITD mutations. The data demonstrated the heterogeneity of cell phenotype distribution and distinct patterns of signaling activation across AML samples and between AML and normal samples. The mTOR targets p-4EBP1 and p-S6 were exclusively found in FLT3-ITD stem/progenitor cells, but not in their normal counterparts, suggesting both as novel targets in FLT3 mutated AML. Our data suggest that CyTOF can identify functional signaling pathways in antigen-defined subpopulations in primary AML, which may provide a rationale for designing therapeutics targeting LSC-enriched cell populations.","['Han, Lina', 'Qiu, Peng', 'Zeng, Zhihong', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', 'Mak, Duncan H', 'Burks, Jared K', 'Schober, Wendy', 'McQueen, Teresa J', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Tanner, Scott D', 'Roboz, Gail J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Han L', 'Qiu P', 'Zeng Z', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Mak DH', 'Burks JK', 'Schober W', 'McQueen TJ', 'Cortes J', 'Tanner SD', 'Roboz GJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Kornblau SM', 'Guzman ML', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M']","['Department of Leukemia, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA163481/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 OD007399/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20150116,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

We here analyzed the long-term outcome of 131 consecutive patients with active AML, which was either primary refractory or unresponsive to salvage chemotherapy, transplanted at our center between 1997 and 2013. After a median follow-up of 48 months for the surviving patients, disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 yr post alloSCT was 26% (94% CI: 17-35). Relapses, most of which occurred within the first 2 yr from transplant, were the predominant cause of treatment failure affecting 48% (95%CI: 40-58) of patients, whereas non-relapse mortality was 26% (95%CI: 20-36) at 5 yr and thereafter. A marrow blast count >/=20% before alloSCT was an independent prognosticator associated with an inferior DFS (HR: 1.58, P = 0.027), whereas the development of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) predicted an improved DFS (HR 0.21, P < 0.001) and a decreased relapse incidence (HR: 0.18, P = 0.026), respectively. These results indicate that alloSCT represents a curative treatment option in a substantial proportion of patients with refractory AML. A pretransplant blast count <20% before alloSCT and the development of cGvHD are the most important predictors of long-term disease control.","['Hemmati, Philipp G', 'Terwey, Theis H', 'Na, Il-Kang', 'Jehn, Christian F', 'le Coutre, Philipp', 'Vuong, Lam G', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Arnold, Renate']","['Hemmati PG', 'Terwey TH', 'Na IK', 'Jehn CF', 'le Coutre P', 'Vuong LG', 'Dorken B', 'Arnold R']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150324,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/01/20 06:00,2016/10/14 06:00,['2015/01/20 06:00'],"['2014/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12522 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Dec;95(6):498-506. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12522.

The cumulative incidence of platelet recovery on day 100 was significantly lower in the ATG cohort compared with the non-ATG cohort (77.3% versus 89.8%) (P = .046). There was no significant difference in the incidence of grade II to IV acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and transplantation-related mortality (TRM) between the 2 groups (P = .76, P = .57, and P = .46, respectively). The incidence of CMV infection was significantly higher among the ATG group compared with that among the non-ATG group (P = .003). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly higher in the ATG cohort (30.7% versus 15.4%) (P = .009).

Giant condyloma acuminatum is a locally invasive, destructive, and large sized mass. Risk factors for the development of giant condyloma acuminatum include an immunodeficient state, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection, post-organ transplantation, or post-allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. However, reports of giant condyloma after bone marrow transplantation are extremely rare (0.3 to 1.3%). The standard treatment for giant condyloma acuminatum is recommended as wide surgical resection due to its high rate of success and low rate of recurrence. CASE PRESENTATION: A 31-year-old Korean man presented to our hospital with anal discomfort for more than one month due to a protruding mass. He had a history of BCR-ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and had undergone an allogenic stem cell transplantation. Gross findings revealed a large perianal cauliflower-like mass over 7cm in size with invasion of the anal orifice. He was diagnosed with giant anal condyloma occurring after an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. However, we achieved successful treatment using a combination of topical podophyllin and cryotherapy and transanal surgical excision, followed by bleomycin irrigation. CONCLUSIONS: We report an extremely rare case of giant condyloma acuminatum of anus due to human papillomavirus type six in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia following an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The tumor was successfully treated with a combination of topical podophyllin and cryotherapy and transanal surgical excision, followed by bleomycin irrigation.","['Hyun, Jin-Soo', 'Kim, Gee-Bum', 'Choi, Byung-Seok', 'Kim, Min-Sung', 'Park, Sang-Gon']","['Hyun JS', 'Kim GB', 'Choi BS', 'Kim MS', 'Park SG']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hemato-oncology, 365 Pilmun-daero, Dong-gu, Gwangju 501-717, Republic of Korea. sgpark@chosun.ac.kr.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150119,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,IM,"['Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage', 'Anus Neoplasms/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Condylomata Acuminata/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Cryotherapy/methods', 'Human papillomavirus 6/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Papillomavirus Infections/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Podophyllin/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4334849,,2015/01/20 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2015/01/20 06:00'],"['2014/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1752-1947-9-9 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-9-9 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2015 Jan 19;9:9. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-9-9.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '9000-55-9 (Podophyllin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to determine whether ALL survivors have smaller cortical surface area and/or thickness, and test whether this is related to disease and treatment variables and self-reported executive functioning in everyday life. PROCEDURE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 130 adult long-term survivors of childhood ALL (age: 18-46 years; age at diagnosis: 0-16 years; years since diagnosis: 7-40) and 130 healthy controls were assessed to estimate and compare regional cortical surface area and thickness. Information on disease and treatment factors were obtained from patients' records, and executive functioning in survivors was measured using a validated questionnaire (BRIEF-A). RESULTS: Smaller cortical surface area was observed in several regions in both cerebral hemispheres in ALL survivors. In these regions, mean surface area was 4.1-5.5% smaller in ALL survivors compared to healthy controls. In contrast, only one region showed lower cortical thickness in ALL survivors. There were no significant associations between cortical surface area/thickness in these regions and disease or treatment variables. In ALL survivors, smaller surface area in prefrontal regions, encompassing parts of the superior frontal gyri and the left anterior cingulate cortex, was associated with problems in executive functioning, specifically with emotional control and self-monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: ALL survivors had smaller surface area in several cortical regions and smaller surface area in prefrontal regions was associated with reported problems in executive functioning.","['Tamnes, Christian K', 'Zeller, Bernward', 'Amlien, Inge K', 'Kanellopoulos, Adriani', 'Andersson, Stein', 'Due-Tonnessen, Paulina', 'Ruud, Ellen', 'Walhovd, Kristine B', 'Fjell, Anders M']","['Tamnes CK', 'Zeller B', 'Amlien IK', 'Kanellopoulos A', 'Andersson S', 'Due-Tonnessen P', 'Ruud E', 'Walhovd KB', 'Fjell AM']","['Research Group for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition, Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150118,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cerebral Cortex/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Executive Function', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*pathology', '*Survivors']",,,2015/01/20 06:00,2015/07/23 06:00,['2015/01/20 06:00'],"['2014/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25386 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jun;62(6):1027-34. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25386.

Crenolanib is also an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta and is in clinical trials in both gastrointestinal stromal tumors and gliomas. Methods We tested crenolanib interactions with the multidrug resistance-associated ATP-binding cassette proteins ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein), ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein) and ABCC1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1), which are expressed on AML cells and other cancer cells and are important components of the blood-brain barrier. Results We found that crenolanib is a substrate of ABCB1, as evidenced by approximate five-fold resistance of ABCB1-overexpressing cells to crenolanib, reversal of this resistance by the ABCB1-specific inhibitor PSC-833 and stimulation of ABCB1 ATPase activity by crenolanib. In contrast, crenolanib was not a substrate of ABCG2 or ABCC1. Additionally, it did not inhibit substrate transport by ABCB1, ABCG2 or ABCC1, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Finally, incubation of the FLT3-ITD AML cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM-14 with crenolanib at a pharmacologically relevant concentration of 500 nM did not induce upregulation of ABCB1 cell surface expression. Conclusions Thus ABCB1 expression confers resistance to crenolanib and likely limits crenolanib penetration of the central nervous system, but crenolanib at therapeutic concentrations should not alter cellular exposure to ABC protein substrate chemotherapy drugs.","['Mathias, Trevor J', 'Natarajan, Karthika', 'Shukla, Suneet', 'Doshi, Kshama A', 'Singh, Zeba N', 'Ambudkar, Suresh V', 'Baer, Maria R']","['Mathias TJ', 'Natarajan K', 'Shukla S', 'Doshi KA', 'Singh ZN', 'Ambudkar SV', 'Baer MR']","['University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, 22 South Greene Street, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA134274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 BC010030/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150120,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/metabolism', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC7709138,['NIHMS1644602'],2015/01/20 06:00,2016/01/20 06:00,['2015/01/20 06:00'],"['2014/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-015-0205-y [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2015 Apr;33(2):300-9. doi: 10.1007/s10637-015-0205-y.

Exome sequencing of two unrelated individuals and subsequent Sanger sequencing of 16 individuals with an overlapping phenotype identified a total of 14 rare, predicted deleterious alleles in CLPB in 14 individuals from 9 unrelated families. CLPB encodes caseinolytic peptidase B homolog ClpB, a member of the AAA+ protein family. To evaluate the relevance of CLPB in the pathogenesis of this syndrome, we developed a zebrafish model and an in vitro assay to measure ATPase activity. Suppression of clpb in zebrafish embryos induced a central nervous system phenotype that was consistent with cerebellar and cerebral atrophy that could be rescued by wild-type, but not mutant, human CLPB mRNA. Consistent with these data, the loss-of-function effect of one of the identified variants (c.1222A>G [p.Arg408Gly]) was supported further by in vitro evidence with the mutant peptides abolishing ATPase function. Additionally, we show that CLPB interacts biochemically with ATP2A2, known to be involved in apoptotic processes in severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) 3 (Kostmann disease [caused by HAX1 mutations]). Taken together, mutations in CLPB define a syndrome with intellectual disability, congenital neutropenia, progressive brain atrophy, movement disorder, cataracts, and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria.","['Wortmann, Saskia B', 'Zietkiewicz, Szymon', 'Kousi, Maria', 'Szklarczyk, Radek', 'Haack, Tobias B', 'Gersting, Soren W', 'Muntau, Ania C', 'Rakovic, Aleksandar', 'Renkema, G Herma', 'Rodenburg, Richard J', 'Strom, Tim M', 'Meitinger, Thomas', 'Rubio-Gozalbo, M Estela', 'Chrusciel, Elzbieta', 'Distelmaier, Felix', 'Golzio, Christelle', 'Jansen, Joop H', 'van Karnebeek, Clara', 'Lillquist, Yolanda', 'Lucke, Thomas', 'Ounap, Katrin', 'Zordania, Riina', 'Yaplito-Lee, Joy', 'van Bokhoven, Hans', 'Spelbrink, Johannes N', 'Vaz, Frederic M', 'Pras-Raves, Mia', 'Ploski, Rafal', 'Pronicka, Ewa', 'Klein, Christine', 'Willemsen, Michel A A P', 'de Brouwer, Arjan P M', 'Prokisch, Holger', 'Katsanis, Nicholas', 'Wevers, Ron A']","['Wortmann SB', 'Zietkiewicz S', 'Kousi M', 'Szklarczyk R', 'Haack TB', 'Gersting SW', 'Muntau AC', 'Rakovic A', 'Renkema GH', 'Rodenburg RJ', 'Strom TM', 'Meitinger T', 'Rubio-Gozalbo ME', 'Chrusciel E', 'Distelmaier F', 'Golzio C', 'Jansen JH', 'van Karnebeek C', 'Lillquist Y', 'Lucke T', 'Ounap K', 'Zordania R', 'Yaplito-Lee J', 'van Bokhoven H', 'Spelbrink JN', 'Vaz FM', 'Pras-Raves M', 'Ploski R', 'Pronicka E', 'Klein C', 'Willemsen MA', 'de Brouwer AP', 'Prokisch H', 'Katsanis N', 'Wevers RA']","[""Nijmegen Centre for Mitochondrial Disorders (NCMD), Amalia Children's Hospital, Radboudumc, 6500HB Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

It has been demonstrated to have significant activity predominantly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia in phase I/II clinical trials while other similar CDK inhibitors are vigorously being pursued in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Although flavopiridol is a potent therapeutic agent against blood diseases, some patients still have primary or acquired resistance throughout their clinical course. Considering the limited knowledge of resistance mechanisms of flavopiridol, we investigated the potential mechanisms of resistance to flavopiridol in a cell line system, which gradually acquired resistance to flavopiridol in vitro, and then confirmed the mechanism in patient samples. Herein, we present that this resistant cell line developed resistance through up-regulation of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain, activation of CDK9 kinase activity, and prolonged Mcl-1 stability to counter flavopiridol's drug actions. Further analyses suggest MAPK/ERK activation-mediated Mcl-1 stabilization contributes to the resistance and knockdown of Mcl-1 in part restores sensitivity to flavopiridol-induced cytotoxicity. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that CDK9 is the most relevant target of flavopiridol and provide avenues to improve the therapeutic strategies in blood malignancies.","['Yeh, Yuh-Ying', 'Chen, Rong', 'Hessler, Joshua', 'Mahoney, Emilia', 'Lehman, Amy M', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Plunkett, William', 'Byrd, John C', 'Johnson, Amy J']","['Yeh YY', 'Chen R', 'Hessler J', 'Mahoney E', 'Lehman AM', 'Heerema NA', 'Grever MR', 'Plunkett W', 'Byrd JC', 'Johnson AJ']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 CA186712/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA076576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Stability', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Polymerase II/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC4413609,,2015/01/19 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/19 06:00'],"['2014/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2096 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2096 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Feb 20;6(5):2667-79. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2096.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00098371'],,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Experimental. SETTING: Laboratory. PATIENT(S): Women with symptomatic leiomyomas. INTERVENTION(S): Endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and leiomyoma cells were isolated from surgical specimens. Leiomyoma-conditioned media (LCM) was applied to cultured ESC. The TGF-beta was blocked by two approaches: TGF-beta pan-specific antibody or transfection with a mutant TGF-beta receptor type II. Cells were then treated with recombinant human BMP-2 to assess BMP responsiveness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Expression of BMP receptor types 1A, 1B, 2, as well as endometrial receptivity mediators HOXA10 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). RESULT(S): Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed elevated TGF-beta levels in LCM. LCM treatment of ESC reduced expression of BMP receptor types 1B and 2 to approximately 60% of pretreatment levels. Preincubation of LCM with TGF-beta neutralizing antibody or mutant TGF receptor, but not respective controls, prevented repression of BMP receptors. HOXA10 and LIF expression was repressed in recombinant human BMP-2 treated, LCM exposed ESC. Pretreatment of LCM with TGF-beta antibody or transfection with mutant TGF receptor prevented HOXA10 and LIF repression. CONCLUSION(S): Leiomyoma-derived TGF-beta was necessary and sufficient to alter endometrial BMP-2 responsiveness. Blockade of TGF-beta prevents repression of BMP-2 receptors and restores BMP-2-stimulated expression of HOXA10 and LIF. Blockade of TGF signaling is a potential strategy to improve infertility and pregnancy loss associated with uterine leiomyoma.","['Doherty, Leo F', 'Taylor, Hugh S']","['Doherty LF', 'Taylor HS']","['Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.

However, high levels of Bcl-2 family proteins in CML could resist paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Herein, we utilized two BH3 mimetics ABT-737 and S1 to study the potential of BH3 mimetics in combination with paclitaxel in treatment of CML cells and illustrated the mechanism by which BH3 mimetics synergize with paclitaxel. As a single agent, S1 could induce apoptosis in CML-derived cell line K562, whereas ABT-737 was largely ineffective. However, both of the two agents could efficiently synergize with paclitaxel through intrinsic apoptosis pathway. By using Bcl-2 siRNA, Bcl-XL siRNA or Mcl-1 siRNA, we found although each of the three members exhibited activities to block paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, Mcl-1 was the determinant for the synergistic effect between paclitaxel and ABT-737 or S1. Furthermore, paclitaxel/ABT737 synergized to drastically upregulate Bim to displace Bak from Mcl-1, whereas S1 directly binds Mcl-1 to release both Bim and Bak. As such, ABT-737 and S1 sensitized CML to paclitaxel by Mcl-1 inhibition, indirect inhibition through Bim antagonizing Mcl-1, or direct inhibition through binding to Mcl-1 itself. Finally, activation of JNK/Bim pathway was identified as the apical mechanism for ABT-737/paclitaxel synergism. Together, our results demonstrated potent synergy between BH3 mimetics and paclitaxel in the killing of CML cells and revealed an important role for Mcl-1 in mediating synergism by these agents.","['Song, Ting', 'Chai, Gaobo', 'Liu, Yubo', 'Xie, Mingzhou', 'Chen, Qingbin', 'Yu, Xiaoyan', 'Sheng, Hongkun', 'Zhang, Zhichao']","['Song T', 'Chai G', 'Liu Y', 'Xie M', 'Chen Q', 'Yu X', 'Sheng H', 'Zhang Z']","['School of Chemistry, State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.', 'School of Chemistry, State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.', 'School of Chemistry, State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.

Our findings demonstrate for the first time that CD56(low)CD16(low) natural killer cells are more abundant in bone marrow than in peripheral blood and that their frequency is further increased in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Bone marrow and peripheral blood CD56(low)CD16(low) natural killer cells compared with CD56(low)CD16(high) natural killer cells express lower levels of killer inhibitory receptors, higher levels of CD27, CD127, CD122, CD25, but undetectable levels of CD57, suggesting that they have a higher proliferative and differentiation potential. Moreover, CD56(low)CD16(low) natural killer cells display higher levels of CXCR4 and undetectable levels of CX3CR1 and can be consistently and rapidly mobilized in peripheral blood in response to CXCR4 antagonist. Unlike CD56(low)CD16(high), both bone marrow and peripheral blood CD56(low)CD16(low) natural killer cells release IFNgamma following cytokine stimulation, and represent the major cytotoxic natural killer cell population against K562 or acute lymphoblastic leukemia target cells. All these data suggest that CD56(low)CD16(low) natural killer cells are multifunctional cells, and that the presence of hematologic malignancies affects their frequency and functional ability at both tumor site and in the periphery.","['Stabile, Helena', 'Nisti, Paolo', 'Morrone, Stefania', 'Pagliara, Daria', 'Bertaina, Alice', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Santoni, Angela', 'Gismondi, Angela']","['Stabile H', 'Nisti P', 'Morrone S', 'Pagliara D', 'Bertaina A', 'Locatelli F', 'Santoni A', 'Gismondi A']","['Department Molecular Medicine, University of Rome ""La Sapienza""', 'Department Molecular Medicine, University of Rome ""La Sapienza""', 'Department Experimental Medicine, University of Rome ""La Sapienza""', 'Department Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome and University of Pavia.', 'Department Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome and University of Pavia.', 'Department Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome and University of Pavia.', 'Department Molecular Medicine, University of Rome ""La Sapienza"" Italian Institute of Technology, Genova, Italy.', 'Department Molecular Medicine, University of Rome ""La Sapienza"" Eleonora Lorillard Spencer Cenci Foundation, Rome angela.gismondi@uniroma1.it.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150116,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Degranulation/immunology', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Interferons/biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/*metabolism']",PMC4380722,,2015/01/18 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,['2015/01/18 06:00'],"['2015/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.116053 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.116053 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Apr;100(4):489-98. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.116053.

ASXL1 mutations were associated with older age (P<0.0001), male sex (P=0.041), secondary acute myeloid leukemia (P<0.0001), and lower values for bone marrow (P<0.0001) and circulating (P<0.0001) blasts. ASXL1 mutations occurred in all cytogenetic risk-groups; normal karyotype (40%), other intermediate-risk cytogenetics (26%), high-risk (24%) and low-risk (10%) cytogenetics. ASXL1 mutations were associated with RUNX1 (P<0.0001) and IDH2(R140) mutations (P=0.007), whereas there was an inverse correlation with NPM1 (P<0.0001), FLT3-ITD (P=0.0002), and DNMT3A (P=0.02) mutations. Patients with ASXL1 mutations had a lower complete remission rate (56% versus 74%; P=0.0002), and both inferior event-free survival (at 5 years: 15.9% versus 29.0%; P=0.02) and overall survival (at 5 years: 30.3% versus 45.7%; P=0.0004) compared to patients with wildtype ASXL1. In multivariable analyses, ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutation as a single variable did not have a significant impact on prognosis. However, we observed a significant interaction (P=0.04) for these mutations, in that patients with the genotype ASXL1(mutated)/RUNX1(mutated) had a higher risk of death (hazard ratio 1.8) compared to patients without this genotype.

Total number of patients was 103; median age was 65 years (range 39-85). Median number of prior lines of therapy was 4 (range 1-13), including, in most cases, rituximab-, fludarabine- and alemtuzumab-based regimens; 13 patients had been allografted. Of 113 adverse events, 28 (29%) were considered to be directly related to ofatumumab. Grade 3-4 toxicities included neutropenia (10%), thrombocytopenia (5%), anemia (3%), pneumonia (17%), and fever (3%). Two heavily pre-treated patients developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. On an intention-to-treat analysis, the overall response rate was 22% (3 complete response, 1 incomplete complete response). Median progression-free and overall survival times were 5 and 11 months, respectively. This study confirms in a daily-life setting the feasibility and acceptable toxicity of ofatumumab treatment in advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The complete response rate, however, was low. Therefore, treatment with ofatumumab should be moved to earlier phases of the disease. Ideally, this should be done in combination with other agents, as recently approved for ofatumumab plus chlorambucil as front-line treatment for patients unfit for fludarabine.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of flow cytometric analysis of LEF1 in the diagnosis of CLL/SLL. METHODS: Normal peripheral blood was used to validate the test. Flow cytometric analysis of LEF1 was performed in 64 patient samples qualitatively and quantitatively by comparing the staining intensity and the ratios of the median fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of LEF1 in B cells of interest to the internal reference cell populations. The results were correlated with the pathologic diagnosis. RESULTS: Proper sample processing ensured sufficient separation of positive LEF1 staining in T cells from negative staining in normal B and natural killer (NK) cells. Qualitative analysis of patient samples showed that all 25 cases of CLL/SLL but none of the other small B-cell lymphomas were positive for LEF1. Using a B/NK MFI ratio of 1.5 and B/T MFI ratio of 0.45 separated CLL/SLL cases from non-CLL lymphomas. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometric analysis of LEF1 is sufficient to differentiate CLL/SLL from other small B-cell lymphomas and may serve as a useful tool in the diagnosis of CLL/SLL.,"['Amador-Ortiz, Catalina', 'Goolsby, Charles L', 'Peterson, LoAnn C', 'Wolniak, Kristy L', 'McLaughlin, Janet L', 'Gao, Juehua', 'Chen, Yi-Hua']","['Amador-Ortiz C', 'Goolsby CL', 'Peterson LC', 'Wolniak KL', 'McLaughlin JL', 'Gao J', 'Chen YH']","['From the Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL.', 'From the Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL.

Despite some advance in procedures for distinguishing specific pathway (or network) topology between different disease status, statistical inference at a population level remains unsolved and further development is still needed. To identify the specific pathways contributing to diseases, we attempt to develop powerful statistics which can capture the complex relationship among risk factors. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) data obtained from 133 adults (98 patients and 35 controls; 47% female). RESULTS: Simulation studies indicated that the proposed Pathway Effect Measures (PEM) were stable; bootstrap-based methods outperformed the others, with bias-corrected bootstrap CI method having the highest power. Application to real data of AML successfully identified the specific pathway (Treg-->TGFbeta-->Th17) effect contributing to AML with p values less than 0.05 under various methods and the bias-corrected bootstrap CI (-0.214 to -0.020). It demonstrated that Th17-Treg correlation balance was impaired in patients with AML, suggesting that Th17-Treg imbalance potentially plays a role in the pathogenesis of AML. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed bootstrap-based PEM are valid and powerful for detecting the specific pathway effect contributing to disease, thus potentially providing new insight into the underlying mechanisms and ways to study the disease effects of specific pathways more comprehensively.","['Ji, Jiadong', 'Yuan, Zhongshang', 'Zhang, Xiaoshuai', 'Li, Fangyu', 'Xu, Jing', 'Liu, Ying', 'Li, Hongkai', 'Wang, Jia', 'Xue, Fuzhong']","['Ji J', 'Yuan Z', 'Zhang X', 'Li F', 'Xu J', 'Liu Y', 'Li H', 'Wang J', 'Xue F']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Neurology, Capital Medical University, Xuanwu Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'School of Mathematics, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Shandong University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150116,England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/immunology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Statistical', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*metabolism', 'Th17 Cells/*metabolism']",PMC4298111,,2015/01/18 06:00,2015/09/16 06:00,['2015/01/18 06:00'],"['2015/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2014-006721 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006721 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2015 Jan 16;5(1):e006721. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006721.,,['NOTNLM'],"['EPIDEMIOLOGY', 'STATISTICS & RESEARCH METHODS']","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

We performed induction and consolidation chemotherapy at doses calculated by using the actual body weight of an obese patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A 47-year-old Japanese man presented with pancytopenia at our hospital, and he was diagnosed with AML (FAB classification M0). At the initial diagnosis, the patient was 170 cm tall and weighed 132 kg; therefore, his body surface area was 2.37 m(2). His performance status and organ functions were quite good. The calculations for determining doses of anticancer drugs required were based on his actual body weight. He received induction chemotherapy and achieved complete remission. Subsequently, he was treated with 4 courses of consolidation chemotherapy. Febrile neutropenia was a complication during each course, and it was relieved via myeloid recovery. Chemotherapy was administered every 4-5 weeks, except for the second course where platelet recovery was prolonged, and the prescribed treatment was completed. The guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommend that physicians routinely use an obese patient's actual body weight to calculate the appropriate doses of almost all chemotherapy drugs. Therefore, the ease and compromised usage of under-dosing because of heaviness owing to obesity should be avoided.","['Kawaguchi, Yurika', 'Inagaki, Atsushi', 'Sato, Yumiko', 'Ogura, Hiroka', 'Wakita, Atsushi']","['Kawaguchi Y', 'Inagaki A', 'Sato Y', 'Ogura H', 'Wakita A']","['Dept. of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City West Medical Center.']",['jpn'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Although PAX5 fusion genes significantly affect the transcription of PAX5 target genes, their role in sustaining leukemia cell survival is poorly understood. In an in vitro model of PAX5/ETV6 leukemia, we demonstrated that Lck hyper-activation, and down-regulation of its negative regulator Csk, lead to STAT5 hyper-activation and consequently to the up-regulation of the downstream effectors, cMyc and Ccnd2. More important, cells from PAX5 translocated patients show LCK up-regulation and over-activation, as well as STAT5 hyper-phosphorylation, compared to PAX5 wt and PAX5 deleted cases. As in BCR/ABL1 positive ALL, the hyper-activation of STAT5 pathway can represent a survival signal in PAX5 translocated cells, alternative to the pre-BCR, which is down-regulated. The LCK inhibitor BIBF1120 selectively reverts this phenomenon both in the murine model and in leukemic primary cells. LCK inhibitor could therefore represent a suitable candidate drug to target this subgroup of ALL patients.","['Cazzaniga, Valeria', 'Bugarin, Cristina', 'Bardini, Michela', 'Giordan, Marco', 'te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Fazio, Grazia', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni']","['Cazzaniga V', 'Bugarin C', 'Bardini M', 'Giordan M', 'te Kronnie G', 'Basso G', 'Biondi A', 'Fazio G', 'Cazzaniga G']","['Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, Monza 20900, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, Monza 20900, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, Monza 20900, Italy.', ""Laboratory of Oncohematology, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova 35128, Italy."", ""Laboratory of Oncohematology, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova 35128, Italy."", ""Laboratory of Oncohematology, Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova 35128, Italy."", 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, Monza 20900, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, Monza 20900, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo/Fondazione MBBM, Monza 20900, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC4359315,,2015/01/18 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/18 06:00'],"['2014/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2807 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2807 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Jan 30;6(3):1569-81. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2807.,"['0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed systematic database search and identified highly specific MED12 mutations in CLL patients. To study this further, we collected three independent sample series comprising over 700 CLL samples and screened MED12 exons 1 and 2 by direct sequencing. Mutations were identified at significant frequency in all three series with a combined mutation frequency of 5.2% (37/709). Positive mutation status was found to be associated with unmutated IGHV and ZAP70 expression, which are well-known poor prognosis markers in CLL. Our results recognize CLL as the first extrauterine cancer type where 5'terminus of MED12 is mutated at significant frequency. Functional analyses have shown that these mutations lead to dissociation of Cyclin C-CDK8/19 from the core Mediator and to the loss of Mediator-associated CDK kinase activity. Additional studies on the role of MED12 mutation status as a putative prognostic factor as well as mutations' exact tumorigenic mechanism in CLL are warranted.","['Kampjarvi, Kati', 'Jarvinen, Tiina M', 'Heikkinen, Tuomas', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Senter, Leigha', 'Hoag, Kevin W', 'Dufva, Olli', 'Kontro, Mika', 'Rassenti, Laura', 'Hertlein, Erin', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Byrd, John C', 'de la Chapelle, Albert', 'Vahteristo, Pia']","['Kampjarvi K', 'Jarvinen TM', 'Heikkinen T', 'Ruppert AS', 'Senter L', 'Hoag KW', 'Dufva O', 'Kontro M', 'Rassenti L', 'Hertlein E', 'Kipps TJ', 'Porkka K', 'Byrd JC', 'de la Chapelle A', 'Vahteristo P']","['Department of Medical Genetics and Genome-Scale Biology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Division of Human Cancer Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Medical Genetics and Genome-Scale Biology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Division of Human Cancer Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Division of Human Cancer Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Medical Genetics and Genome-Scale Biology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Moores University of California-San Diego Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Moores University of California-San Diego Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Medicine, Helsinki University Central Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Division of Human Cancer Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Medical Genetics and Genome-Scale Biology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50-CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mediator Complex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis']",PMC4359339,,2015/01/18 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/18 06:00'],"['2014/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2753 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2753 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Jan 30;6(3):1884-8. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2753.,"['0 (MED12 protein, human)', '0 (Mediator Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We provide a comprehensive study on mutations to enhance the understanding of therapeutic targets and studied 81 adult T-ALL patients. NOTCH1 exhibitedthe highest mutation rate (53%). Mutation frequencies of FBXW7 (10%), WT1 (10%), JAK3 (12%), PHF6 (11%), and BCL11B (10%) were in line with previous reports. We identified recurrent alterations in transcription factors DNM2, and RELN, the WNT pathway associated cadherin FAT1, and in epigenetic regulators (MLL2, EZH2). Interestingly, we discovered novel recurrent mutations in the DNA repair complex member HERC1, in NOTCH2, and in the splicing factor ZRSR2. A frequently affected pathway was the JAK/STAT pathway (18%) and a significant proportion of T-ALL patients harboured mutations in epigenetic regulators (33%), both predominantly found in the unfavourable subgroup of early T-ALL. Importantly, adult T-ALL patients not only showed a highly heterogeneous mutational spectrum, but also variable subclonal allele frequencies implicated in therapy resistance and evolution of relapse. In conclusion, we provide novel insights in genetic alterations of signalling pathways (e.g. druggable by gamma-secretase inhibitors, JAK inhibitors or EZH2 inhibitors), present in over 80% of all adult T-ALL patients, that could guide novel therapeutic approaches.","['Neumann, Martin', 'Vosberg, Sebastian', 'Schlee, Cornelia', 'Heesch, Sandra', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Graf, Alexander', 'Krebs, Stefan', 'Bartram, Isabelle', 'Blum, Helmut', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Hecht, Jochen', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Greif, Philipp A', 'Baldus, Claudia D']","['Neumann M', 'Vosberg S', 'Schlee C', 'Heesch S', 'Schwartz S', 'Gokbuget N', 'Hoelzer D', 'Graf A', 'Krebs S', 'Bartram I', 'Blum H', 'Bruggemann M', 'Hecht J', 'Bohlander SK', 'Greif PA', 'Baldus CD']","['Charite, Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Berlin, Germany.', ""Clinical Cooperative Group 'Leukemia', Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany."", 'Department of Internal Medicine 3, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'Charite, Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite, Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Berlin, Germany.', 'Charite, Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Berlin, Germany.', 'Goethe University Hospital, Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Frankfurt/M., Germany.', 'Goethe University Hospital, Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Frankfurt/M., Germany.', 'Laboratory for Functional Genome Analysis, Gene-Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Functional Genome Analysis, Gene-Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'Charite, Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Berlin, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Functional Genome Analysis, Gene-Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'University Hospital Kiel, Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany.', 'Berlin-Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies (BCRT), Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', ""Clinical Cooperative Group 'Leukemia', Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany."", 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', ""Clinical Cooperative Group 'Leukemia', Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany."", 'Department of Internal Medicine 3, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat (LMU), Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Charite, Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precision Medicine', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence', 'Reelin Protein', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC4413615,,2015/01/18 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/18 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2218 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2218 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Feb 20;6(5):2754-66. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2218.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Reelin Protein)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (RELN protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is an urgent need for the development of new medicines for chemotherapy of these devastating diseases. In this study, three newly designed thiosemicarbazone iron chelators, TSC24, Dp44mT and 3-AP, were tested for in vitro activity against bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma brucei and human leukaemia HL-60 cells. In addition to their iron chelating properties, TSC24 and Dp44mT inhibit topoisomerase IIalpha while 3-AP inactivates ribonucleotide reductase. All three compounds exhibited anti-trypanosomal activity, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging between 1 and 100 microM and 50% growth inhibition (GI50) values of around 250 nM. Although the compounds did not kill HL-60 cells (MIC values >100 microM), TSC24 and Dp44mT displayed considerable cytotoxicity based on their GI50 values. Iron supplementation partly reversed the trypanotoxic and cytotoxic activity of TSC24 and Dp44mT but not of 3-AP. This finding suggests possible synergy between the iron chelating and topoisomerase IIalpha inhibiting activity of the compounds. However, further investigation using separate agents, the iron chelator deferoxamine and the topoisomerase II inhibitor epirubicin, did not support any synergy for the interaction of iron chelation and topoisomerase II inhibition. Furthermore, TSC24 was shown to induce DNA degradation in bloodstream forms of T. brucei indicating that the mechanism of trypanotoxic activity of the compound is topoisomerase II independent. In conclusion, the data support further investigation of thiosemicarbazone iron chelators with dual activity as lead compounds for anti-trypanosomal drug development.","['Ellis, Samuel', 'Sexton, Darren W', 'Steverding, Dietmar']","['Ellis S', 'Sexton DW', 'Steverding D']","['BioMedical Research Centre, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'BioMedical Research Centre, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom.', 'BioMedical Research Centre, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom.

Although BLV has a tropism for B cells, it can affect both adaptive and innate immunities because these systems share many effector mechanisms. This scenario is the basis of this investigation of the effects of BLV on mammary gland immunity, which is largely dependent upon neutrophilic functions. Thus, the present study sought to examine neutrophilic functions and the lymphocyte profile in the milk of naturally BLV-infected cows. The viability of the milk neutrophils and the percentage of milk neutrophils that produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) or phagocytosed Staphylococcus aureus were similar between BLV-infected and BLV-uninfected dairy cows. Furthermore, the expression of CD62L and CD11b by the milk neutrophils and the percentage of milk neutrophils (CH138+ cells) that were obtained from the udder quarters of the BLV-infected cows were not altered. Conversely, the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) representing intracellular ROS production and the phagocytosis of S. aureus, the expression of CD44 by the milk neutrophils and the percentage of apoptotic B cells were lower in the milk cells from BLV-infected dairy cows, particularly those from animals with persistent lymphocytosis (PL). The lymphocyte subsets were not different among the groups, with the exception of the percentage of CD5-/CD11b- B cells, which was higher in the milk cells from BLV-infected cows, particularly those with PL.

Factors such as risk for disease relapse, nonrelapse mortality associated with different PRT approaches, donor availability, prospects for salvage should disease relapse, and patient preference all affect PRT choice. RECENT FINDINGS: New genetic markers refine AML risk stratification and identify patients within the 'classical' risk groups who may benefit from transplant-based or chemotherapy-based PRT. The use of minimal residual disease in first remission to guide PRT choice and the application of novel, targeted therapies have the potential to alter PRT approaches across AML risk groups. The advent of alternative donor sources, use of reduced intensity regimens, and improved supportive care all affect the availability and safety of transplant-based PRT and challenge the relevance of the older legacy 'donor/no-donor' genetically randomized trials. SUMMARY: Genetic risk assessment, monitoring of minimal residual disease in first remission, use of targeted agents, and the newer transplant strategies all have the potential to 'personalize' PRT choice in the AML patient. The clinical value of these novel interventions awaits validation in prospective, risk-adapted clinical trials.","['Wolach, Ofir', 'Stone, Richard M']","['Wolach O', 'Stone RM']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Core Binding Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2015/01/17 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,['2015/01/17 06:00'],"['2015/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000119 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2015 Mar;22(2):123-31. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000119.,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Menin acts as a tumor suppressor in endocrine organs while it is also required for transformation of a subgroup of leukemia. The recently solved crystal structure of menin with different binding partners reveals that menin is a key scaffold protein that cross-talks with various partners, including transcription factors, to regulate gene transcription. Our recent findings unravel a previously undiscovered mechanism for menin-mediated control of gene expression via processing of certain microRNA's, thus adding to the plethora of ways in which menin regulates gene expression. By interacting with ARS2, an RNA binding protein, menin facilitates the processing of pri-let 7a and pri-miR155 to pre-let 7a and pre-miR155 respectively. Consistently, excision of the Men1 gene results in upregulation of IRS2, a let-7a target. As IRS2 is known to mediate both insulin signaling and insulin-induced cell proliferation, and let-7a targets include oncogenes like RAS and HMGA2, a deeper understanding of the menin-ARS2 complex in regulating miRNA biogenesis will yield further insights into the pathogenesis of the MEN1 syndrome and other menin-associated malignancies.","['Gurung, Buddha', 'Katona, Bryson W', 'Hua, Xianxin']","['Gurung B', 'Katona BW', 'Hua X']","['Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 421 Curie Blvd., BRB II/III, Philadelphia, PA-19104, USA.', 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 421 Curie Blvd., BRB II/III, Philadelphia, PA-19104, USA ; Division of Gastroenterology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 421 Curie Blvd., BRB II/III, Philadelphia, PA-19104, USA.', 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, 421 Curie Blvd., BRB II/III, Philadelphia, PA-19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 DK050306/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK085121/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007066/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20140915,United States,Oncoscience,Oncoscience,101636666,,,PMC4278340,,2015/01/17 06:00,2015/01/17 06:01,['2015/01/17 06:00'],"['2014/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/17 06:01 [medline]']","['79 [pii]', '10.18632/oncoscience.79 [doi]']",epublish,Oncoscience. 2014 Sep 15;1(9):562-6. doi: 10.18632/oncoscience.79. eCollection 2014.,,['NOTNLM'],"['ARS2', 'IRS1', 'Let7a', 'Menin', 'beta cell', 'miRNA processing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used 2 human xenograft mouse models of AML to assess the anti-leukaemic effects of PEP005 in vivo. Expression microarray analysis of primary AML blasts following treatment with PEP005 was used to determine patterns of gene expression that conferred resistance. PEP005 significantly reduced tumour burden in two human leukaemia mouse xenograft models. We also assessed responsiveness of 33 AML samples to PEP005, with 78% of the samples entering apoptosis at 100nM. Resistance to PEP005 was not restricted to a particular AML subtype. Expression microarray analysis of resistant samples following treatment with PEP005 revealed a significant up regulation of the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2A1, Mcl-1, and PHLDA1 which was verified using RT-PCR. We conclude that PEP005 shows broad efficacy against AML subtypes and that up regulation of anti-apoptotic genes underlies resistance to this agent and could be used to screen for patients unlikely to benefit from a therapeutic regime involving PEP005.","['Hampson, Peter', 'Wang, Keqing', 'Ersvaer, Elisabeth', 'McCormack, Emmet', 'Schuler, Julia', 'Fiebig, Heinz-Herbert', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Lord, Janet M']","['Hampson P', 'Wang K', 'Ersvaer E', 'McCormack E', 'Schuler J', 'Fiebig HH', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bruserud O', 'Lord JM']","['School of Immunity and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.', 'Department of Biosciences, University of Aston, Birmingham, B4 7ET.', 'Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, NO-5020, Norway.', 'Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, NO-5020, Norway.', 'Oncotest GmbH, 79801 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Oncotest GmbH, 79801 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, NO-5020, Norway.', 'Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, Bergen, NO-5020, Norway.', 'School of Immunity and Infection, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, B15 2TT, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140806,United States,Oncoscience,Oncoscience,101636666,,,PMC4278328,,2015/01/17 06:00,2015/01/17 06:01,['2015/01/17 06:00'],"['2014/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/17 06:01 [medline]']","['71 [pii]', '10.18632/oncoscience.71 [doi]']",epublish,Oncoscience. 2014 Aug 6;1(8):529-39. doi: 10.18632/oncoscience.71. eCollection 2014.,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'PEP005', 'PKC', 'anti-apoptotic', 'xenograft model']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

As we discuss here, reasons include the low abundance of most of the relevant mutations and particularly the combinatorial complexity of possible combination therapies. Our report provides a systematic and quantitative account of the implications of combinatorial complexity for cancer precision medicine and clinical trial design.

All constructs retain a high level of catalytic activity and differ in net charge. Using acute myeloid leukemia cells Kasumi-1 we have shown that (i) cytotoxicity of RNase Sa mutants is linearly enhanced by cationization, (ii) the ability of cytotoxic mutants to induce cell death is caused by induction of apoptosis and (iii) localization of positive charge on N-terminus does not contribute to RNase Sa cytotoxicity.

However, acquired resistance to imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib (1(st) and 2(nd) generation TKIs), due in part to BCR-ABL1 kinase mutations, has been largely described. These drugs are ineffective on the T315I gatekeeper substitution, which remains sensitive to 3(rd) generation TKI ponatinib. It has recently been suggested that the hematopoietic niche could protect leukemic cells from targeted therapy. In order to investigate the role of a stromal niche in mutation-related resistance, we developed a niche-based cell mutagenesis assay. For this purpose, ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea)-exposed UT-7 cells expressing non-mutated or T315I-mutated BCR-ABL1 were cultured with or without murine MS-5 stromal cells and in the presence of imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or ponatinib. In the assays relative to 1(st) and 2(nd) generation TKIs, which were performed on non-mutated BCR-ABL1 cells, our data highlighted the increasing efficacy of the latter, but did not reveal any substantial effect of the niche. In ponatinib assays performed on both non-mutated and T315I-mutated BCR-ABL1 cells, an increased number of resistant clones were observed in the presence of MS-5. Present data suggested that T315I mutants need either compound mutations (e.g. E255K/T315I) or a stromal niche to escape from ponatinib. Using array-comparative genomic hybridization experiments, we found an increased number of variations (involving some recurrent chromosome regions) in clones cultured on MS-5 feeder. Overall, our study suggests that the hematopoietic niche could play a crucial role in conferring resistance to ponatinib, by providing survival signals and favoring genetic instability.","['Aggoune, Djamel', 'Tosca, Lucie', 'Sorel, Nathalie', 'Bonnet, Marie-Laure', 'Dkhissi, Fatima', 'Tachdjian, Gerard', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli, Annelise', 'Chomel, Jean-Claude', 'Turhan, Ali G']","['Aggoune D', 'Tosca L', 'Sorel N', 'Bonnet ML', 'Dkhissi F', 'Tachdjian G', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli A', 'Chomel JC', 'Turhan AG']","['INSERM, U935, F-86000 Poitiers, France.', ""INSERM, U935, F-94800, Villejuif, France ; Universite Paris-Sud 11, F-94270 Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France ; Hopital Antoine Beclere, Service d'Histologie-Embryologie-Cytogenetique, F-92140 Clamart, France."", 'INSERM, U935, F-86000 Poitiers, France ; CHU de Poitiers, Service de Cancerologie Biologique, F-86000 Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM, U935, F-86000 Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM, U935, F-86000 Poitiers, France.', ""INSERM, U935, F-94800, Villejuif, France ; Universite Paris-Sud 11, F-94270 Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France ; Hopital Antoine Beclere, Service d'Histologie-Embryologie-Cytogenetique, F-92140 Clamart, France."", ""INSERM, U935, F-94800, Villejuif, France ; Universite Paris-Sud 11, F-94270 Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France ; Hopital Paul Brousse, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, F-94800 Villejuif, France."", 'INSERM, U935, F-86000 Poitiers, France ; CHU de Poitiers, Service de Cancerologie Biologique, F-86000 Poitiers, France.', ""INSERM, U935, F-86000 Poitiers, France ; INSERM, U935, F-94800, Villejuif, France ; Universite Paris-Sud 11, F-94270 Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France ; Hopital Bicetre, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, F-94270 Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140130,United States,Oncoscience,Oncoscience,101636666,,,PMC4295758,,2015/01/17 06:00,2015/01/17 06:01,['2015/01/17 06:00'],"['2013/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/17 06:01 [medline]']","['9 [pii]', '10.18632/oncoscience.9 [doi]']",epublish,Oncoscience. 2014 Jan 30;1(1):57-68. doi: 10.18632/oncoscience.9. eCollection 2014.,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'CML', 'ENU-mutagenesis', 'TKI resistance', 'microenvironment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a case of intussusception in a 29-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She developed right lower quadrant pain, fever, and vomiting on day 16 of induction chemotherapy. Physical examination showed tenderness and guarding at the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed distension of the cecum and ascending colon, which were filled with loops of small bowel, and herniation of the ileocecal valve into the cecum. We proceeded to laparotomy and revealed ileocecal intussusception with the ileocecal valve as the leading point. The terminal ileum was thickened and invaginated into the cecum, which showed gangrenous changes. Right hemicolectomy was performed and microscopic examination of the colonic tissue showed infiltration of leukemic cells. The patient recovered after the operation and was subsequently able to continue treatment for AML. This case demonstrates that the diagnosis of intussusception is difficult because the presenting symptoms can be non-specific, but abdominal CT can be informative for preoperative diagnosis. Resection of the involved bowel is recommended when malignancy is suspected or confirmed. Intussusception should be considered in any leukemia patients presenting with acute abdomen. A high index of clinical suspicion is important for early diagnosis.","['Law, Man Fai', 'Wong, Cheuk Kei', 'Pang, Chun Yin', 'Chan, Hay Nun', 'Lai, Ho Kei', 'Ha, Chung Yin', 'Ng, Celia', 'Yeung, Yiu Ming', 'Yip, Sze Fai']","['Law MF', 'Wong CK', 'Pang CY', 'Chan HN', 'Lai HK', 'Ha CY', 'Ng C', 'Yeung YM', 'Yip SF']","['Man Fai Law, Hay Nun Chan, Ho Kei Lai, Chung Yin Ha, Celia Ng, Yiu Ming Yeung, Sze Fai Yip, Department of Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Man Fai Law, Hay Nun Chan, Ho Kei Lai, Chung Yin Ha, Celia Ng, Yiu Ming Yeung, Sze Fai Yip, Department of Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Man Fai Law, Hay Nun Chan, Ho Kei Lai, Chung Yin Ha, Celia Ng, Yiu Ming Yeung, Sze Fai Yip, Department of Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Man Fai Law, Hay Nun Chan, Ho Kei Lai, Chung Yin Ha, Celia Ng, Yiu Ming Yeung, Sze Fai Yip, Department of Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Man Fai Law, Hay Nun Chan, Ho Kei Lai, Chung Yin Ha, Celia Ng, Yiu Ming Yeung, Sze Fai Yip, Department of Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Man Fai Law, Hay Nun Chan, Ho Kei Lai, Chung Yin Ha, Celia Ng, Yiu Ming Yeung, Sze Fai Yip, Department of Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Man Fai Law, Hay Nun Chan, Ho Kei Lai, Chung Yin Ha, Celia Ng, Yiu Ming Yeung, Sze Fai Yip, Department of Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Man Fai Law, Hay Nun Chan, Ho Kei Lai, Chung Yin Ha, Celia Ng, Yiu Ming Yeung, Sze Fai Yip, Department of Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Man Fai Law, Hay Nun Chan, Ho Kei Lai, Chung Yin Ha, Celia Ng, Yiu Ming Yeung, Sze Fai Yip, Department of Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,IM,"['Abdominal Pain/etiology', 'Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Colectomy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ileal Diseases/diagnosis/etiology/surgery', '*Ileocecal Valve/surgery', 'Intussusception/diagnosis/*etiology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/diagnosis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4292305,,2015/01/17 06:00,2015/09/04 06:00,['2015/01/17 06:00'],"['2014/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3748/wjg.v21.i2.688 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2015 Jan 14;21(2):688-93. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v21.i2.688.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Abdominal pain', 'Acute leukemia', 'Colon', 'Intussusception', 'Malignancy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relapse can arise from residual LSCs that have distinct sensitivity and dependencies when compared with the AML bulk. AML-LSCs are driven by genetic and epigenomic changes, and these alterations influence prognosis and clonal selection. Therapies targeting these molecular aberrations have been developed and show promising responses in advanced clinical trials; however, so far success with LSCs has been limited. Besides the genetic diversity, AML-LSCs are critically influenced by the microenvironment, and a third crucial aspect has recently come to the fore: A group of evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways such as canonical Wnt signaling, Notch signaling, or the Hedgehog pathway can be essential for maintenance of AML-LSC but may be redundant for normal hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, early reports suggest also regulators of cell polarity may also influence hematopoietic stem cells and AML biology. Interactions between these pathways have been investigated recently and suggest a network of signaling pathways involved in regulation of self-renewal and response to oncogenic stress. Here, we review how recent discoveries on regulation of AML-LSC-relevant evolutionarily conserved pathways may open opportunities for novel treatment approaches eradicating residual disease.","['Heidel, Florian H', 'Arreba-Tutusaus, Patricia', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Fischer, Thomas']","['Heidel FH', 'Arreba-Tutusaus P', 'Armstrong SA', 'Fischer T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Center for Internal Medicine, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Center for Internal Medicine, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute, New York, New York.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Center for Internal Medicine, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.

Thus, ITK and RLK inhibitors have therapeutic potential in a number of human autoimmune, inflammatory, and malignant diseases. Here we describe a novel ITK/RLK inhibitor, PRN694, which covalently binds to cysteine residues 442 of ITK and 350 of RLK and blocks kinase activity. Molecular modeling was utilized to design molecules that interact with cysteine while binding to the ATP binding site in the kinase domain. PRN694 exhibits extended target residence time on ITK and RLK and is highly selective for a subset of the TEC kinase family. In vitro cellular assays confirm that PRN694 prevents T-cell receptor- and Fc receptor-induced cellular and molecular activation, inhibits T-cell receptor-induced T-cell proliferation, and blocks proinflammatory cytokine release as well as activation of Th17 cells. Ex vivo assays demonstrate inhibitory activity against T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia cells, and in vivo assays demonstrate durable pharmacodynamic effects on ITK, which reduces an oxazolone-induced delayed type hypersensitivity reaction. These data indicate that PRN694 is a highly selective and potent covalent inhibitor of ITK and RLK, and its extended target residence time enables durable attenuation of effector cells in vitro and in vivo. The results from this study highlight potential applications of this dual inhibitor for the treatment of T-cell- or NK cell-mediated inflammatory, autoimmune, and malignant diseases.","['Zhong, Yiming', 'Dong, Shuai', 'Strattan, Ethan', 'Ren, Li', 'Butchar, Jonathan P', 'Thornton, Kelsey', 'Mishra, Anjali', 'Porcu, Pierluigi', 'Bradshaw, J Michael', 'Bisconte, Angelina', 'Owens, Timothy D', 'Verner, Erik', 'Brameld, Ken A', 'Funk, Jens Oliver', 'Hill, Ronald J', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Dubovsky, Jason A']","['Zhong Y', 'Dong S', 'Strattan E', 'Ren L', 'Butchar JP', 'Thornton K', 'Mishra A', 'Porcu P', 'Bradshaw JM', 'Bisconte A', 'Owens TD', 'Verner E', 'Brameld KA', 'Funk JO', 'Hill RJ', 'Johnson AJ', 'Dubovsky JA']","['From the Division of Hematology, College of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'the Division of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, and.', 'From the Division of Hematology, College of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'From the Division of Hematology, College of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'From the Division of Hematology, College of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'From the Division of Hematology, College of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'From the Division of Hematology, College of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'From the Division of Hematology, College of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Principia Biopharma, South San Francisco, California 94080.', 'Principia Biopharma, South San Francisco, California 94080.', 'Principia Biopharma, South San Francisco, California 94080.', 'Principia Biopharma, South San Francisco, California 94080.', 'Principia Biopharma, South San Francisco, California 94080.', 'Principia Biopharma, South San Francisco, California 94080.', 'Principia Biopharma, South San Francisco, California 94080 ron.hill@principiabio.com.', 'From the Division of Hematology, College of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'From the Division of Hematology, College of Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, jason.dubovsky@nationwidechildrens.org.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA095426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20150115,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Benzimidazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Binding Sites', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Cysteine/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology']",PMC4358234,,2015/01/17 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2015/01/17 06:00'],"['2015/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)46737-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.614891 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Mar 6;290(10):5960-78. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.614891.

We report structural evidence showing that in WRAD, a concave surface of the Ash2L SPIa and ryanodine receptor (SPRY) domain binds to a cluster of acidic residues, referred to as the D/E box, in RbBP5. Mutational analysis shows that residues forming the Ash2L/RbBP5 interface are important for heterodimer formation, stimulation of MLL1 catalytic activity, and erythroid cell terminal differentiation. We also demonstrate that a phosphorylation switch on RbBP5 stimulates WRAD complex formation and significantly increases KMT2 (lysine [K] methyltransferase 2) enzyme methylation rates.

ALT is mediated by recombination and is prevalent in a subset of human cancers, yet whether it can be exploited therapeutically remains unknown. Loss of the chromatin-remodeling protein ATRX associates with ALT in cancers. Here, we show that ATRX loss compromises cell-cycle regulation of the telomeric noncoding RNA TERRA and leads to persistent association of replication protein A (RPA) with telomeres after DNA replication, creating a recombinogenic nucleoprotein structure. Inhibition of the protein kinase ATR, a critical regulator of recombination recruited by RPA, disrupts ALT and triggers chromosome fragmentation and apoptosis in ALT cells. The cell death induced by ATR inhibitors is highly selective for cancer cells that rely on ALT, suggesting that such inhibitors may be useful for treatment of ALT-positive cancers.","['Flynn, Rachel Litman', 'Cox, Kelli E', 'Jeitany, Maya', 'Wakimoto, Hiroaki', 'Bryll, Alysia R', 'Ganem, Neil J', 'Bersani, Francesca', 'Pineda, Jose R', 'Suva, Mario L', 'Benes, Cyril H', 'Haber, Daniel A', 'Boussin, Francois D', 'Zou, Lee']","['Flynn RL', 'Cox KE', 'Jeitany M', 'Wakimoto H', 'Bryll AR', 'Ganem NJ', 'Bersani F', 'Pineda JR', 'Suva ML', 'Benes CH', 'Haber DA', 'Boussin FD', 'Zou L']","['Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA.

Treatment with CIP-36 significantly inhibited the growth of the K562 and MDR K562/A02 cells. Our data demonstrated that CIP-36 induced apoptosis, inhibited cell cycle progression and inhibited Topo IIalpha activity. These findings suggest that CIP-36 has the potential to overcome the multidrug resistance of K562/A02 cells by mediating Topo IIalpha activity.","['Cao, Bo', 'Chen, Hong', 'Gao, Ying', 'Niu, Cong', 'Zhang, Yuan', 'Li, Ling']","['Cao B', 'Chen H', 'Gao Y', 'Niu C', 'Zhang Y', 'Li L']","[""Logistics University of Chinese People's Armed Police Forces, Tianjin, Hebei 300162, P.R.

Genetic alterations are widely recognized as the main drivers of oncogenic transformation. Of considerable interest are mutations affecting the writers of epigenetic marks. In this review, we focus on histone methyltransferases--enzymes that catalyze the methylation of lysine residues in core histones. Histone methylation is a tightly controlled mechanism that is responsible for both activating as well as repressing gene expression in a site-specific manner, depending on which lysine residue is methylated. Histone methyltransferases, including MLL1, DOT1L, EZH2, and SETD2 are recurrently deregulated in human leukemia, either directly by gene mutations or balanced translocations, or indirectly as components of protein complexes that are disturbed in leukemia due to alterations of the other components in these complexes. Several small molecule inhibitors of histone methyltransferases are currently being clinically evaluated for their therapeutic potential in human leukemia. These drugs reverse some of the adverse effects of aberrant histone methylation, and can induce differentiation and cell death in leukemic blasts.","['Chopra, Martin', 'Bohlander, Stefan K']","['Chopra M', 'Bohlander SK']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.

METHODS: In this study, we decided to investigate DNMT3A possible expression changes with regard to their mutation and cytogenetic status in a series of 96 AML patients. RESULTS: Mutations were founded in 17 of the 96 patients (17.7%) and associated with higher age and white blood cell count (P < 0.001). Our mutants have had shorter overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.011) than those without. Multivariate analysis showed that DNMT3A mutation is an independent prognostic indicator for OS and RFS (P < 0.001). In relation to expression results, we had over and under expression for our favorable and unfavorable cytogenetic subgroups, respectively (P = 0.005 and P < 0.001, respectively). In intermediate subgroup, total DNMT3A expression did not alter (P = 0.575). Interestingly, we noticed similar expression results for DNMT3A transcript 2, to that of the total. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In relation to DNMT3A expression, from the perspective of diagnostic application and its biological significance, it is difficult to accept its primacy over cytogenetic value in favorable and unfavorable subgroups and if so, we did not address this issue in our study due to sample size limitation. In intermediate subgroup, particularly in normal karyotype-AML, given the lack of convincing results, it seems unlikely that DNMT3A expression analysis could attract attention in diagnostic workup and risk prediction of AML.","['Zare-Abdollahi, Davood', 'Safari, Shamsi', 'Movafagh, Abolfazl', 'Riazi-Isfahani, Sahand', 'Ghadyani, Mojtaba', 'Hashemi-Gorji, Feyzollah', 'Feyzollah, Hashemi-Gorji', 'Nasrollahi, Mohammad Foad', 'Omrani, Mir Davood']","['Zare-Abdollahi D', 'Safari S', 'Movafagh A', 'Riazi-Isfahani S', 'Ghadyani M', 'Hashemi-Gorji F', 'Feyzollah HG', 'Nasrollahi MF', 'Omrani MD']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150116,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', '*DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/genetics/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Survival Rate']",,,2015/01/17 06:00,2016/04/28 06:00,['2015/01/17 06:00'],"['2015/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000001 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Aug;20(7):397-404. doi: 10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000001.

Our method selects a small relevant subset from tens of thousands of genes while simultaneously identifying nontrivial higher order topological features, i.e., holes, in the data. We first circumvent the problem of high dimensionality by dualizing the data, i.e., by studying genes as points in the sample space. Then we select a small subset of the genes as landmarks to construct topological structures that capture persistent, i.e., topologically significant, features of the data set in its first homology group. Furthermore, we demonstrate that many members of these loops have been implicated for cancer biogenesis in scientific literature. We illustrate our method on five different data sets belonging to brain, breast, leukemia, and ovarian cancers.","['Lockwood, S', 'Krishnamoorthy, B']","['Lockwood S', 'Krishnamoorthy B']","['School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164, U.S.A. svetlana.lockwood@email.wsu.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Pac Symp Biocomput,Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

METHODS: Using case listing session of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 (1973-2010), we examined outcomes for AYA with ALL defined similar to Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 10,403 criteria (age 18-30) predicated on marital and insurance status as surrogates for emancipation (limiting analysis to 2007-2010). Analyses were conducted with SEER*Stat 8.1.2, Microsoft Excel 2007, and GraphPad Prism 6. Comparisons were made by the Fisher exact test and log rank test (Mantel-Cox); all P values were 2-sided. RESULTS: Although age (24 and younger vs. 25 and older) was predictive of median overall survival (OS) (not reached vs. 33; P = .0029) (3-year OS 66% vs. 49%), social factors were not. Three-year OS for insured versus uninsured patients was 61% versus 50%, and median OS was not reached versus 30 months (P = .2334). Three-year OS for single versus married patients was 62% versus 55%, with median OS not reached for both groups (P = .1084). CONCLUSION: Insurance status and marriage did not influence outcomes for AYA with ALL, suggesting that intrinsic differences in disease and disease-specific therapies are more important than social issues.","['Fintel, Andrew E', 'Jamy, Omer', 'Martin, Mike G']","['Fintel AE', 'Jamy O', 'Martin MG']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, The West Clinic, University of Tennessee Health and Science Center, Memphis, TN.

Aurora kinase is one of the serine/threonine kinase family members and is a vital and critical regulator of mitosis and meiosis. In the present study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of a combined treatment of ABT-737 and VX-680 (Aurora kinase inhibitor) in human breast cancer MDA-MB435S cells. ABT-737 plus VX-680 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in the human breast cancer cells. Combined treatment with ABT-737 and VX-680 led to the downregulation of Bcl-2 expression at the transcriptional level and the downregulation of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 expression at the post-transcriptional level. Overexpression of Bcl-2 or c-FLIP could not block the induction of apoptosis caused by the combined treatment with ABT-737 and VX-680. However, overexpression of Mcl-1 partially inhibited the induction of apoptosis. In contrast, the combined treatment with ABT-737 and VX680 had no effect on the apoptosis in normal cells. Taken together, our study demonstrated that combined treatment with ABT-737 and VX-680 induced apoptosis in antiapoptotic protein (Bcl-2 or c-FLIP)-overexpressing cells.","['Choi, Jung Eun', 'Woo, Seon Min', 'Min, Kyoung-Jin', 'Kang, Su Hwan', 'Lee, Soo Jung', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Choi JE', 'Woo SM', 'Min KJ', 'Kang SH', 'Lee SJ', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Immunology, Keimyung University, School of Medicine, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, Keimyung University, School of Medicine, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, Keimyung University, School of Medicine, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Surgery, Yeungnam University, College of Medicine, Namgu, Daegu 705-703, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Surgery, Yeungnam University, College of Medicine, Namgu, Daegu 705-703, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Immunology, Keimyung University, School of Medicine, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 704-701, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150115,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Aurora Kinase A/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Combinations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",,,2015/01/17 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2015.3728 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2015 Mar;33(3):1395-401. doi: 10.3892/or.2015.3728.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether children with cancer met their antioxidant requirements. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed at a single hospital in England from June 2008 to February 2010. Children with a solid tumour, lymphoma or leukaemia were included. Dietary intakes including 3 modes of feeding ('diet alone', 'diet + tube' feeding or 'diet + vitamin-mineral supplementation' (VMS)) were collected with an estimated food record (EFR) 1 and 3 month post-diagnosis. Four and 24-hr food recalls were performed to validate the food records. RESULTS: Forty two children were included: 57% leukaemia or lymphoma and 43% solid tumours. Sixty seven percent underwent chemotherapy and 33% a combination of therapies. In months 1 and 3, greater numbers of children achieved >/=100% of requirements for 'diet + VMS' (p < 0.05) than for other feeding modes. However, considerable proportions of all feeding groups did not achieve 100% of the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) for vitamin A, C, E, selenium and zinc. This was most marked in the 'diet alone' group. Significant proportions did not achieve the Lower Recommended Nutrient Intake (LRNI) for some antioxidants. The 'diet alone' group had the highest proportion not meeting LRNI for vitamin A (p << 0.001; 1st month) and zinc (p < 0.02; 3rd month). CONCLUSION: Inadequate antioxidant intake was observed in a significant proportion of cancer patients when feeding was not augmented in any way. More research is required to determine the clinical implications of these findings.","['Slegtenhorst, Sonja', 'Visser, Janicke', 'Burke, Amos', 'Meyer, Rosan']","['Slegtenhorst S', 'Visser J', 'Burke A', 'Meyer R']","['Dept of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Box 181, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Addenbrookes Hospital, Hills Road, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire CB2 0QQ, United Kingdom; Division of Human Nutrition, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, PO BOX 19063, Tygerberg 7505, South Africa.

Novel targeted therapies have dramatically changed the prognosis of a number of oncological diseases. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) oncoprotein are used in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Imatinib mesylate, which was the first anti-BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has demonstrated a high tolerance profile and efficacy in these patients for many years. Good results have also been observed in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In this study, we describe two patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive hematological malignancies who presented with secondary thrombotic microangiopathy that was most likely linked to the use of imatinib. Other potential causes of thrombotic microangiopathy were discarded, and the predisposing role of some comorbidities and potential short or long-term drug-drug interactions was assessed. The clinical and biological data were more indicative of atypical secondary hemolytic uremic syndrome in one of the cases and of secondary thrombotic microangiopathy with renal and cardiac impairment in the other, which is also categorized as secondary hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Although low bone mineral density (BMD) has been reported in leukemia patients after HCT, little is known about BMD in FA children after HCT (FA HCT). This study's goals were to compare BMD in FA HCT to BMD in healthy controls and in children who received HCT for hematologic malignancy (cancer HCT), and to test for associations between BMD and risk factors for bone loss. This cross-sectional study included 20 FA HCT, 13 cancer HCT, and 90 healthy controls, age-matched and <18 years old at evaluation. BMD Z-scores for total body (TBMD) and lumbar spine (LBMD) were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and adjusted for height-for-age Z-score (HAZ). FA HCT had lower mean TBMDHAZ Z-score (by .8 SD) and higher fraction with Z-score </= -1 than healthy controls (42% versus 11%). No LBMD deficits were detected. FA HCT and cancer HCT groups did not differ significantly in TBMD or LBMD Z-scores. In FA HCT patients, lower body mass index and lower percent fat were associated with lower BMD.

However, the biological functions of PCGF6 are unknown. METHOD: qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect the expression profile of PCGF6 in testes. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry was used to examine the cellular localization of PCGF6 protein in testes. Cell proliferation was tested by performing CCK-8 and EdU incorporation assay. Cell cycle and haploid cell population analysis was determined by flow cytometry using propidium iodide DNA staining. Co-immunoprecipitation experiment was conducted using PCGF6 antibody to obtain interacting protein of PCGF6. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to examine the promoter activity of PCGF6 in cells overexpressing OVOL1 and PLZF. RESULTS: PCGF6 was expressed predominantly in meiotic and post-meiotic male germ cells, could negatively regulate the proliferation of GC-2 spd cells, an immortalized mouse spermatogenic cell line, and could modulate the differentiation of GC-2 spd cells in vitro. PCGF6 could indirectly interact with HSPA2, a key factor that is essential for male meiosis, and OVOL1 and PLZF, two key transcription factors that are involved in spermatogenesis, could positively and negatively modulate Pcgf6 promoter activity, respectively. PCGF1, BMI1, and PCGF5 are also highly expressed in mouse testes like PCGF6. CONCLUSION: PCGF6 may play important roles in male germ cell development.","['Sun, Jin', 'Wang, Jian', 'He, Lin', 'Lin, Yi', 'Wu, Ji']","['Sun J', 'Wang J', 'He L', 'Lin Y', 'Wu J']","['Key Laboratory for the Genetics of Developmental & Neuropsychiatric Disorders (Ministry of Education), Bio-X Institutes, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150112,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Germ Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Spermatids/metabolism', 'Spermatogenesis/*genetics', 'Testis/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",,,2015/01/17 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2015/01/17 06:00'],"['2014/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['000369700 [pii]', '10.1159/000369700 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2015;35(1):339-52. doi: 10.1159/000369700.

METHODS: A total of 381 patients with de nova AML and 430 healthy controls were enrolled. All patients received Ara-C-based standard induction chemotherapy regimens, and the treatment response was evaluated. Several polymorphisms in the human OPN encoding gene have been identified. The OPN) gene polymorphisms at 3 loci, namely, -156 GG>G, -443 C>T and -66T>G were determined. RESULTS: We identified that the -443C>T polymorphism was the only one which is closely related to AML. Compared with the -443TT carriers, our data showed that the -443CC genotype carriers were significantly related to a higher risk for AML. The -443CC genotype was also more prevalent in poor response groups than in good response group. The -443CC carriers are more likely to have poor response to AML treatment. Cellular assay indicated that the leukemic cell lines receiving the OPN -443C transfection have a significantly lower apoptosis rate to Ara-C treatment compared to cell lines transfected with -443T. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest OPN-443C>T gene polymorphism may be sued as a molecular for susceptibility and chemotherapy response of AML.","['Zhang, Rong', 'Yang, Wei', 'Li, Ying Chun', 'Zhang, Guo Jun', 'Yao, Kun', 'Hu, Rong', 'Wu, Bin']","['Zhang R', 'Yang W', 'Li YC', 'Zhang GJ', 'Yao K', 'Hu R', 'Wu B']","['Department of Hematology, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Shengjing City, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150102,Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'China', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteopontin/blood/*genetics/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Transfection']",,,2015/01/17 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2015/01/17 06:00'],"['2014/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['000369685 [pii]', '10.1159/000369685 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2015;35(1):175-83. doi: 10.1159/000369685.

However, for an optimally responding patient it is recommended to follow the TKI therapy indefinitely. The question about the possibility of safe TKI treatment discontinuation in certain clinical situations was raised and is currently under close investigation worldwide. Currently, imatinib discontinuation trails have shown that about 60% of eligible patients experienced molecular recurrence within 6 months of treatment discontinuation, while the remaining 40% remained in defined deep molecular response throughout the duration of mostly two years follow-up. Interestingly, retreatment with the same TKI or another TKI was successful in the vast majority of patients demonstrating molecular recurrence of the disease. These findings support the concept of safe TKI treatment discontinuation and its usefulness for a specific subset of CML patients. However, recent data are not sufficient for TKI discontinuation attempts outside clinical trials yet. Because of the high risk of potentially problematic molecular recurrences of the pathological clones, the key question is to find the right predictive marker of TKI discontinuation success, however it stays unsolved yet. This minireview brings a concise summary of this hot topic with a realistic view from clinical routine.

At basal conditions in an immature gonadotrope-derived cell line, the hormone-specific beta-subunit gene promoters are densely packed with histones, and contain low levels of H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). GnRH both induces this modification and causes histone loss, creating a more active chromatin state. The H3K4me3 appears to be mediated by menin and possibly catalyzed by the menin-mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) 1/2 methyl transferase complex, as inhibition of MLL recruitment or menin knockdown reduced gene expression and the levels of H3K4me3 on all three promoters. Menin recruitment to the beta-subunit gene promoters is increased by GnRH, possibly involving transcription factors such as estrogen receptor alpha and/or steroidogenic factor 1, with which menin interacts. Menin also interacts with ring finger protein 20, which ubiquitylates H2BK120 (H2BK120ub), which was reported to be a pre-requisite for H3K4me3 at various gene promoters. Although levels of H2BK120ub are increased by GnRH in the coding regions of these genes, levels at the promoters do not correlate with those of H3K4me3, nor with gene expression, suggesting that H3K4me3 is not coupled to H2BK120ub in transcriptional activation of these genes.","['Wijeweera, Andrea', 'Haj, Majd', 'Feldman, Alona', 'Pnueli, Lilach', 'Luo, Zhuojuan', 'Melamed, Philippa']","['Wijeweera A', 'Haj M', 'Feldman A', 'Pnueli L', 'Luo Z', 'Melamed P']","['Faculty of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Israel.', 'Faculty of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Israel.', 'Faculty of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Israel.', 'Faculty of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Israel.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Faculty of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Israel.

Studying of these processes would contribute to better understanding of etiology of immunodeficiency and leukemia, which are caused by abnormal gene regulation during the development of hematopoietic cells. The CD4(+) helper versus CD8(+) cytotoxic T-cell fate decision serves as an excellent model to study binary fate decision processes. These two cell types are derived from common precursors in the thymus. Positive selection of their TCRs by self-peptide presented on either MHC class I or class II triggers their fate decisions along with mutually exclusive retention and silencing of two coreceptors, CD4 and CD8. In the past few decades, extensive effort has been made to understand the T-cell fate decision processes by studying regulation of genes encoding the coreceptors and selection processes. These studies have identified several key transcription factors and gene regulatory networks.

However, the mechanisms by which cordycepin contributes to the anti-tumor still obscure. Here our present work showed that cordycepin inhibits cell growth in NB-4 and U937 cells by inducing apoptosis. Further study showed that cordycepin increases the expression of p53 which promotes the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol. The released cytochrome c can then activate caspase-9 and trigger intrinsic apoptosis. Cordycepin also blocks MAPK pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and thus sensitizes the apoptosis. In addition, our results showed that cordycepin inhibits the expression of cyclin A2, cyclin E, and CDK2, which leads to the accumulation of cells in S-phase. Moreover, our study showed that cordycepin induces DNA damage and causes degradation of Cdc25A, suggesting that cordycepin-induced S-phase arrest involves activation of Chk2-Cdc25A pathway. In conclusion, cordycepin-induced DNA damage initiates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis which leads to the growth inhibition of NB-4 and U937 cells.","['Liao, Yuanhong', 'Ling, Jianya', 'Zhang, Guoying', 'Liu, Fengjun', 'Tao, Shengce', 'Han, Zeguang', 'Chen, Saijuan', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Le, Huangying']","['Liao Y', 'Ling J', 'Zhang G', 'Liu F', 'Tao S', 'Han Z', 'Chen S', 'Chen Z', 'Le H']","['a Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine (Ministry of Education); Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine ; Shanghai Jiao Tong University ; Shanghai , China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Damage', 'Deoxyadenosines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",PMC4615139,,2015/01/16 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/16 06:00'],"['2015/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384101.2014.1000097 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2015;14(5):761-71. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2014.1000097.,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GZ8VF4M2J8 (cordycepin)']",['NOTNLM'],"['ATM, Ataxia telangiectasia mutated', 'ATR, ATM and Rad3-related', 'Cdc25A', 'DNA damage', 'PFT-alpha, Pifithrin-alpha', 'PI, Propidium iodide', 'S-phase arrest', 'XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein.', 'apoptosis', 'cordycepin', 'cytochrome c', 'p53']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 1.0-muM concentration of Se(4+) prevented the cells from undergoing As(3+)-induced apoptosis by inhibiting As(3+) uptake, eliminating As(3+)-generated reactive oxygen species, and repressing the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway. However, 4.0 muM Se(4+) exerted synergistic effects with As(3+) on cell apoptosis by promoting As(3+) uptake, downregulating nuclear factor-small ka, CyrillicB, and activating caspase-3. In addition to apoptosis, 1.0 and 3.2 muM Se(4+) showed contrasting effects on As(3+)-induced differentiation in NB4 cells and primary APL cells. The 3.2 muM Se(4+) enhanced As(3+)-induced differentiation by promoting the degradation of promyelocytic leukemia protein-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML-RARalpha) oncoprotein, but 1.0 muM Se(4+) did not have this effect. Based on mechanistic studies, Se(4+), which is similar to As(3+), might bind directly to Zn(2+)-binding sites of the PML RING domain, thus controlling the fate of PML-RARalpha oncoprotein.","['Wang, S', 'Geng, Z', 'Shi, N', 'Li, X', 'Wang, Z']","['Wang S', 'Geng Z', 'Shi N', 'Li X', 'Wang Z']","['State Key Laboratory of Coordination Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Coordination Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Coordination Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Coordination Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Coordination Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150115,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenites/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Selenious Acid/*pharmacology']",PMC4669761,,2015/01/16 06:00,2015/09/16 06:00,['2015/01/16 06:00'],"['2014/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/19 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014563 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.563 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2015 Jan 15;6:e1596. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.563.,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'F6A27P4Q4R (Selenious Acid)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABT-199 is a rationally designed BCL-2 homology (BH)-3 mimetic that specifically binds to BCL-2, but not to MCL-1 and BCL-xL. Although the thrombocytopenia that occurs with navitoclax treatment has not been a problem with ABT-199, clinical trials in CLL could benefit by lowering the ABT-199 concentration through targeting other survival pathways. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of resistance that develops to ABT-199 therapy by generating ABT-199-resistant (ABT199-R) cell lines via chronic exposure of NHL cell lines to ABT-199. Acquired resistance resulted in substantial AKT activation and upregulation of MCL-1 and BCL-xL levels that sequestered BIM. ABT199-R cells exhibited increased MCL-1 stability and failed to activate BAX in response to ABT-199. The ABT-199 acquired and inherent resistant cells were sensitized to treatment with ABT-199 by inhibitors of the PI3K, AKT, and mTOR pathways, NVP-BEZ235 and GS-1101. NVP-BEZ235, a dual inhibitor of p-AKT and mTOR, reduced MCL-1 levels causing BIM release from MCL-1 and BCL-xL, thus leading to cell death by BAX activation. The PI3Kdelta inhibitor GS-1101 (idelalisib) downregulated MCL-1 and sensitized ABT199-R cells through AKT-mediated BAX activation. A genetic approach, through siRNA-mediated down-regulation of AKT, MCL-1, and BCL-xL, significantly decreased cell survival, demonstrating the importance of these cell survival factors for ABT-199 resistance. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism that modulates the expression and activity of pro-survival proteins to confer treatment resistance that could be exploited by a rational combination therapeutic regimen that could be effective for treating lymphoid malignancies.","['Choudhary, G S', 'Al-Harbi, S', 'Mazumder, S', 'Hill, B T', 'Smith, M R', 'Bodo, J', 'Hsi, E D', 'Almasan, A']","['Choudhary GS', 'Al-Harbi S', 'Mazumder S', 'Hill BT', 'Smith MR', 'Bodo J', 'Hsi ED', 'Almasan A']","['1] Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA [2] Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Institute of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Institute of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA184137/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA127264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150115,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4669737,,2015/01/16 06:00,2015/09/16 06:00,['2015/01/16 06:00'],"['2014/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014525 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.525 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2015 Jan 15;6:e1593. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.525.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'RUJ6Z9Y0DT (dactolisib)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, directly inhibiting this target requires the disruption of high-affinity protein-protein interactions, and therefore designing small molecules potent enough to inhibit MCL-1 in cells has proven extremely challenging. Here, we describe a series of indole-2-carboxylic acids, exemplified by the compound A-1210477, that bind to MCL-1 selectively and with sufficient affinity to disrupt MCL-1-BIM complexes in living cells. A-1210477 induces the hallmarks of intrinsic apoptosis and demonstrates single agent killing of multiple myeloma and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines demonstrated to be MCL-1 dependent by BH3 profiling or siRNA rescue experiments. As predicted, A-1210477 synergizes with the BCL-2/BCL-XL inhibitor navitoclax to kill a variety of cancer cell lines. This work represents the first description of small-molecule MCL-1 inhibitors with sufficient potency to induce clear on-target cellular activity. It also demonstrates the utility of these molecules as chemical tools for dissecting the basic biology of MCL-1 and the promise of small-molecule MCL-1 inhibitors as potential therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.","['Leverson, J D', 'Zhang, H', 'Chen, J', 'Tahir, S K', 'Phillips, D C', 'Xue, J', 'Nimmer, P', 'Jin, S', 'Smith, M', 'Xiao, Y', 'Kovar, P', 'Tanaka, A', 'Bruncko, M', 'Sheppard, G S', 'Wang, L', 'Gierke, S', 'Kategaya, L', 'Anderson, D J', 'Wong, C', 'Eastham-Anderson, J', 'Ludlam, M J C', 'Sampath, D', 'Fairbrother, W J', 'Wertz, I', 'Rosenberg, S H', 'Tse, C', 'Elmore, S W', 'Souers, A J']","['Leverson JD', 'Zhang H', 'Chen J', 'Tahir SK', 'Phillips DC', 'Xue J', 'Nimmer P', 'Jin S', 'Smith M', 'Xiao Y', 'Kovar P', 'Tanaka A', 'Bruncko M', 'Sheppard GS', 'Wang L', 'Gierke S', 'Kategaya L', 'Anderson DJ', 'Wong C', 'Eastham-Anderson J', 'Ludlam MJ', 'Sampath D', 'Fairbrother WJ', 'Wertz I', 'Rosenberg SH', 'Tse C', 'Elmore SW', 'Souers AJ']","['Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Genentech, Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech, Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech, Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech, Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech, Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech, Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech, Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech, Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Genentech, Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie, Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150115,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",PMC4669759,,2015/01/16 06:00,2015/09/16 06:00,['2015/01/16 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/16 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2014561 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.561 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2015 Jan 15;6:e1590. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.561.,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Carboxylic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '1477-50-5 (indole-2-carboxylic acid)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",,,,['Cell Death Dis. 2015;6:e1810.

Manifestations of ATL are diverse and different clinical types with different tissue involvement and aggressiveness have been described. The mechanisms that lead to the development of ATL clinical types have not yet been clarified. Considering that in ATL patients HTLV-1 infection generally occurs in childhood, a multistep carcinogenesis model has been proposed. Microsatellite alterations are important genetic events in cancer development and these alterations have been reported in the aggressive types of ATL. Little is known about oncogenesis of the less aggressive types. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we investigated the role of the microsatellite alterations in the pathogenesis mediated by HTLV-1 in the different types of ATL. We examined the presence of microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozigosity (LOH) in matched pair samples (tumoral and normal) of 24 patients with less aggressive types (smoldering and chronic) and in aggressive types (acute and lymphoma) of ATL. Four microsatellite markers D10S190, D10S191, D1391 and DCC were analyzed. MSI was found in four patients, three smoldering and one chronic, and LOH in four patients, three smoldering and one acute. None of the smoldering patients with microsatellite alterations progressed to aggressive ATL.

Using a reverse immunology approach, we aim to develop a method enabling the identification of T-cell responses directed against predefined antigens, with the goal to select those MiHAs that can be used clinically in combination with allo-SCT. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we used a recently developed MiHA selection algorithm to select candidate MiHAs within the HLA-presented ligandome of transformed B cells. From the HLA-presented ligandome that predominantly consisted of monomorphic peptides, 25 polymorphic peptides with a clinically relevant allele frequency were selected. By high-throughput screening, the availability of high-avidity T cells specific for these MiHA candidates in different healthy donors was analyzed. RESULTS: With the use of MHC multimer enrichment, analyses of expanded T cells by combinatorial coding MHC multimer flow cytometry, and subsequent single-cell cloning, positive T-cell clones directed to two new MiHA: LB-CLYBL-1Y and LB-TEP1-1S could be demonstrated, indicating the immunogenicity of these two MiHAs. CONCLUSIONS: The biologic relevance of MiHA LB-CLYBL-1Y was demonstrated by the detection of LB-CLYBL-1Y-specific T cells in a patient suffering from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that experienced an anti-leukemic response after treatment with allo-SCT.","['Hombrink, Pleun', 'Hassan, Chopie', 'Kester, Michel G D', 'Jahn, Lorenz', 'Pont, Margot J', 'de Ru, Arnoud H', 'van Bergen, Cornelis A M', 'Griffioen, Marieke', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik', 'van Veelen, Peter A', 'Heemskerk, Mirjam H M']","['Hombrink P', 'Hassan C', 'Kester MG', 'Jahn L', 'Pont MJ', 'de Ru AH', 'van Bergen CA', 'Griffioen M', 'Falkenburg JH', 'van Veelen PA', 'Heemskerk MH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.

Dramatic improvements in primary therapy for childhood ALL have led to an overall cure rate of 80 %, providing opportunities for innovative combined-modality strategies that would increase cure rates while reducing the toxic side effects of current intensive regimens. In this study, we report that indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a natural phytochemical found in cruciferous vegetables, had anti-leukemic properties in BCP-ALL NALM-6 cells. I3C induced cell growth inhibition by G1 cell cycle arrest and triggered apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. p53, p21, and Bax proteins showed increased expression after I3C treatment. Real-time PCR analysis of pro-apoptotic p53 target genes revealed up-regulation of PUMA, NOXA, and Apaf-1. I3C also suppressed constitutive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and inhibited the protein expression of NF-kappa B-regulated antiapoptotic (IAP1, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, XIAP) and proliferative (c-Myc) gene products. Coadministration of I3C with the topoisomerase II inhibitor, doxorubicin, potentiates cytotoxic effects compared with either agent alone. Apoptosis induction by the drug combination was associated with enhanced caspase-9 activation and PARP cleavage. Furthermore, I3C abolished doxorubicin-induced NF-kappaB activity as evidenced by decreased nuclear accumulation of p65, inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and its degradation, and decreased NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. Western blot analysis revealed that doxorubicin-induced Bcl-2 protein expression was inhibited by I3C. Overall, our results indicated that using nontoxic agents, such as I3C, in combination with anthracyclines might provide a new insight into the development of novel combination therapies in childhood BCP-ALL.","['Safa, Majid', 'Tavasoli, Behnaz', 'Manafi, Rima', 'Kiani, Fatemeh', 'Kashiri, Meysam', 'Ebrahimi, Saber', 'Kazemi, Ahmad']","['Safa M', 'Tavasoli B', 'Manafi R', 'Kiani F', 'Kashiri M', 'Ebrahimi S', 'Kazemi A']","['Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, safa.m@iums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150115,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*administration & dosage', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,,2015/01/16 06:00,2015/08/06 06:00,['2015/01/16 06:00'],"['2014/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-3035-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2015 May;36(5):3919-30. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-3035-1.

We systematically reviewed the English and foreign language literature to identify risk factors for PSPG and propose a management strategy. METHODS: A systematic review was completed in PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Database for all published reports of PSPG from January 1946 to June 2013. We manually examined bibliographies for relevant references and used Google Translate for articles in foreign languages, including Italian, Japanese, German, Dutch, Turkish, Spanish, Chinese, Dutch, Russian, Portuguese, and Czech. RESULTS: We identified 220 cases of PSPG (mean age 52.8 years, range 5-85 years). Thirty-seven patients (16.8%) had a history of pyoderma gangrenosum, nineteen (8.6%) had a hematologic disorder such as leukemia or lymphoma, thirteen (5.9%) had inflammatory bowel disease, and eight (3.6%) had rheumatoid arthritis. PSPG occurred most commonly after breast (25%), cardiothoracic (14%), abdominal (14%), and obstetric (13%) surgeries. The most common breast procedures were bilateral reduction mammoplasty (45%), breast reconstruction (25%), and lumpectomy or mastectomy (11%). Signs of wound complication occurred on average 7.0 days after surgery. Nineteen patients (8.6%) at risk for PSPG received perioperative corticosteroids during skin grafting or later surgeries with a favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of pyoderma gangrenosum, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or hematologic malignancy who are undergoing breast, cardiothoracic, or abdominal surgeries should be carefully observed for post-operative ulceration at incision sites. Debridement should not be performed before dermatologic consultation to assess for PSPG. Patients at risk of PSPG undergoing breast surgery may benefit from perioperative prednisone to prevent PSPG which can lead to destructive wound enlargement and significant scarring.","['Zuo, Kevin J', 'Fung, Eric', 'Tredget, Edward E', 'Lin, Andrew N']","['Zuo KJ', 'Fung E', 'Tredget EE', 'Lin AN']","['Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Division of Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Division of Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.

Only a minority of MS lesions remyelinates completely. Enhancing remyelination is, therefore, a major aim of future MS therapies. Here we took a novel approach to identify factors that may inhibit or support endogenous remyelination in MS. We dissected remyelinated, demyelinated active, and demyelinated inactive white matter MS lesions, and compared transcript levels of myelination and inflammation-related genes using quantitative PCR on customized TaqMan Low Density Arrays. In remyelinated lesions, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1 was the most abundant of all analyzed myelination-regulating factors, showed a trend towards higher expression as compared to demyelinated lesions and was significantly higher than in control white matter. Two MS tissue blocks comprised lesions with adjacent de- and remyelinated areas and FGF1 expression was higher in the remyelinated rim compared to the demyelinated lesion core. In functional experiments, FGF1 accelerated developmental myelination in dissociated mixed cultures and promoted remyelination in slice cultures, whereas it decelerated differentiation of purified primary oligodendrocytes, suggesting that promotion of remyelination by FGF1 is based on an indirect mechanism. The analysis of human astrocyte responses to FGF1 by genome wide expression profiling showed that FGF1 induced the expression of the chemokine CXCL8 and leukemia inhibitory factor, two factors implicated in recruitment of oligodendrocytes and promotion of remyelination. Together, this study presents a transcript profiling of remyelinated MS lesions and identified FGF1 as a promoter of remyelination. Modulation of FGF family members might improve myelin repair in MS.","['Mohan, Hema', 'Friese, Anita', 'Albrecht, Stefanie', 'Krumbholz, Markus', 'Elliott, Christina L', 'Arthur, Ariel', 'Menon, Ramesh', 'Farina, Cinthia', 'Junker, Andreas', 'Stadelmann, Christine', 'Barnett, Susan C', 'Huitinga, Inge', 'Wekerle, Hartmut', 'Hohlfeld, Reinhard', 'Lassmann, Hans', 'Kuhlmann, Tanja', 'Linington, Chris', 'Meinl, Edgar']","['Mohan H', 'Friese A', 'Albrecht S', 'Krumbholz M', 'Elliott CL', 'Arthur A', 'Menon R', 'Farina C', 'Junker A', 'Stadelmann C', 'Barnett SC', 'Huitinga I', 'Wekerle H', 'Hohlfeld R', 'Lassmann H', 'Kuhlmann T', 'Linington C', 'Meinl E']","['Institute of Clinical Neuroimmunology, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, Marchioninistrasse 15, D-81377, Munich, Germany. hema.mohan@ukmuenster.de.', 'Present address: Department of Neurology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany. hema.mohan@ukmuenster.de.', 'Institute of Clinical Neuroimmunology, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, Marchioninistrasse 15, D-81377, Munich, Germany. anita.friese@web.de.', 'Institute of Neuropathology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, Germany. stefanie.albrecht@ukmuenster.de.', 'Institute of Clinical Neuroimmunology, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich, Marchioninistrasse 15, D-81377, Munich, Germany. markus.krumbholz@med.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Division of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.

Here, we present a patient who developed a type B lactic acidosis presumably due to a concurrent chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Upon swift initiation of cytoreductive chemotherapy (doxorubicin), the lactic acidosis was rapidly brought under control. This case adds to the literature reporting other haematological malignancies that can cause a type B lactic acidosis and its successful treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 77-year-old Caucasian man brought to our Accident and Emergency department following an unwitnessed collapse; he was found surrounded by coffee-ground vomit. Although haemodynamically stable on admission, he rapidly deteriorated as his lactic acid rose. An initial arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.27 and lactate of 18mmol/L (peaking at 21mmol/L). CONCLUSIONS: A high degree of clinical suspicion for haematological malignancy should be held when presented with a patient with lactic acidosis in clinical practice, even without evidence of poor oxygenation or another cause. Treatment with emergency chemotherapy, in lieu of a definitive diagnosis, was rapidly successful at lowering lactate levels within 8 hours. This may suggest a causal and perhaps direct relationship between lactic acid production and the presence of leukemic cells. Veno-venous haemofiltration had no apparent effect on reducing the lactic acidosis and therefore its benefit is questioned in this setting, especially at the cost of delaying chemotherapy. In the face of a life-threatening lactic acidosis, pragmatic clinical judgement alone may justify the rapid initiation of chemotherapy.","['Gardner, Andrew John', 'Griffiths, John']","['Gardner AJ', 'Griffiths J']","['Faculty of Medicine, Oxford University, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK. andrew.gardner@keble.ox.ac.uk.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20150114,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,IM,"['Acidosis, Lactic/*diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Hematoma, Subdural, Acute/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid/blood', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*complications/physiopathology/therapy', 'Male']",PMC4325955,,2015/01/16 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2015/01/16 06:00'],"['2014/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['1752-1947-9-16 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-9-16 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2015 Jan 14;9:16. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-9-16.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of NOC15 and NC15 on L1210 cells is 1.56 and 2.62 mumol/l, respectively, and that the IC50 of NOC15 and NC15 on human normal lymphoblast is 207.9 and 2569 mumol/l, respectively. In cell cycle analysis, NOC15 could increase the sub-G1 phase, whereas NC15 could induce G2/M arrest. Annexin-V apoptosis assay indicated that both NOC15 and NC15 could induce cell apoptosis. In the syngeneic mouse leukemia model, both NOC15 and NC15 could increase the survival days of mice and decrease the tumor weight. Moreover, both NOC15 and NC15 could retard the increase in peripheral blood leukocyte count due to L1210 cells. In the subcutaneous (s.c.) group, the treatment with NOC15 could retard the decrease in the weight of the liver and the spleen caused by L1210 cells, whereas the treatment with NC15 could retard the decrease in the weight of the spleen caused by L1210 cells. We conclude that the new compounds NOC15 and NC15 have strong anticancer activity and low toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. NOC15 and NC15 may have the potential to be developed into anticancer agents in the future.","['Chang, Ming-Che', 'Tsai, En-Tung', 'Wu, Jin-Yi', 'Liao, Hui-Fen', 'Chen, Yu-Jen', 'Kuo, Cheng-Deng']","['Chang MC', 'Tsai ET', 'Wu JY', 'Liao HF', 'Chen YJ', 'Kuo CD']","['aLaboratory of Biophysics, Department of Medical Research, Taipei Veterans General Hospital bDepartment of Radiation Oncology, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei cDepartment of Microbiology, Immunology and Biopharmaceutics, College of Life Sciences dDepartment of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, National Chiayi University, Chiayi, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cantharidin/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000210 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2015 Jun;26(5):508-17. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000210.,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (N-farnesyl-norcantharimide)', '0 (N-farnesyloxy-norcantharimide)', 'IGL471WQ8P (Cantharidin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, only one NF can be upregulated in most genetically modified SCs, and simultaneously upregulating multiple NFs in SCs remains challenging. In this study, we found that the overexpression of c-Jun, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor, effectively upregulated the expression and secretion of multiple NFs, including glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, artemin, leukemia inhibitory factor, and nerve growth factor. The c-Jun gene-modified SCs showed a normal morphology in scanning electron microscopy and fluorescent staining analysis. In addition, the c-Jun-modified SCs showed enhanced proliferation and migration abilities compared with vector control cells. We used transwell chambers to establish coculture systems imitating the in vivo conditions in which transplanted SCs might influence native SCs and neurons. We found that the c-Jun-modified SCs enhanced native SC migration and promoted the proliferation of native SCs in the presence of axons. Further analysis revealed that in the c-Jun group, the average length and the total area of neurites divided by the total area of the explant body were mum 1180+/-25 and 6.4+/-0.4, respectively, which were significantly greater compared with the other groups. These findings raise the possibility of constructing an optimal therapeutic alternative for nerve repair using c-Jun-modified SCs, which have the potential to promote axonal regeneration and functional recovery by upregulating multiple NFs. In addition, these cells exhibit enhanced migration and proliferation abilities, enhance the biological functions of native SCs, and promote neurite outgrowth.","['Huang, Liangliang', 'Quan, Xin', 'Liu, Zhongyang', 'Ma, Teng', 'Wu, Yazhen', 'Ge, Jun', 'Zhu, Shu', 'Yang, Yafeng', 'Liu, Liang', 'Sun, Zhen', 'Huang, Jinghui', 'Luo, Zhuojing']","['Huang L', 'Quan X', 'Liu Z', 'Ma T', 'Wu Y', 'Ge J', 'Zhu S', 'Yang Y', 'Liu L', 'Sun Z', 'Huang J', 'Luo Z']","[""1 Department of Orthopedics, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University , Xi'an, Shaanxi, China .""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Tissue Eng Part A,Tissue engineering.

Our objective is to investigate the antiproliferative effects of flavonoids (baicalein, luteolin, genistein, apigenin, scutellarin, galangin, chrysin, and naringenin) toward leukemia cells (HL-60, NB4, U937, K562, Jurkat) as well as the relationship between their antileukemic potencies and molecular structures. At the proteomic level, we evaluate the effects of different flavonoids on the expression levels of various proteins using Protein Pathway Array (PPA) technology. Our results showed a dose-dependent cytotoxicity of flavonoids toward various types of leukemia cells. The results of PPA illustrated that flavonoids, such as baicalein, genistein, and scutellarin affected different proteins in different leukemia cell lines. Cell cycle regulatory proteins, such as CDK4, CDK6, Cyclin D1, Cyclin B1, p-CDC2, and p-RB were affected in different leukemia cells. Furthermore, we found that baicalein suppresses CDK4 and activates p-ERK in most leukemia cells; genistein mainly affects CDK4, p-ERK, p-CDC2, while scutellarin dysregulated the proteins, cell division control protein 42, Notch4, and XIAP. Collectively, a wide variety of dysregulation of key signaling proteins related to apoptosis and cell-cycle regulation contributes to the antileukemic properties of these flavonoids.","['Liu, Xiaoliang', 'Ye, Fei', 'Wu, Josephine', 'How, Brian', 'Li, Wei', 'Zhang, David Y']","['Liu X', 'Ye F', 'Wu J', 'How B', 'Li W', 'Zhang DY']","['a Department of Hematology and Oncology , First Hospital, Jilin University , Changchun , China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150114,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2015.989372 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2015;67(2):238-49. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2015.989372.

High concentrations induce toxicity, especially hepatic veno-occlusive disease, also referred to as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. This study aimed to assess busulfan pharmacokinetic variability in pretransplant conditioning regimens using an analytical method validated by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector (HPLC/PDA). METHODS: Eight patients who used the test dose (TD) of 1 mg/kg busulfan 10 days before conditioning were included, and 10 serial blood samples were collected to determine: the elimination half-life (t1/2), total area under the curve (AUCT), total clearance (Cl(T)/F), and plasma concentration at steady state (C(ss)), using a monocompartmental model and first-order kinetics. The instrumental conditions were: HPLC/PDA Shimadzu, column ACE C18 (150 mm x 4 mm); methanol/water/acetonitrile (65:20:15) eluent flow rate of 1 mL/min; 1,6-bis-(methanesulfonyloxy)-hexane; UV lambda = 276 nm; analysis time 17 minutes; and derivatization with sodium diethylcarbamate. The dose was adjusted, and 4 blood samples per day were collected at days 2, 3, and 4 of treatment for new plasma determinations. RESULTS: Four patients needed higher doses; the mean dose administered was 1.02 +/- 0.19 mg/kg. Mean results at TD: t1/2 = 2.88 +/- 0.5 hours; Cl(T)/F = 0.18 +/- 0.03 L . h(-1) . kg(-1); AUC(T) = 5461.00 +/- 961.15 ng . mL(-1) . h(-1); and C(ss) = 911.3 +/- 159.8 ng/mL. Mean results of samples collected during conditioning: t1/2 = 3.21 +/- 0.9 hours; Cl(T)/F = 0.13 +/- 0.02 L . h(-1) . kg(-1); AUC(T) = 7571 +/- 1705 ng . mL(-1) . h(-1); and C(ss) = 1262.0 +/- 284.3 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: High variability in the assessed pharmacokinetic parameters was observed, with a 38% variation in C(ss) between TD and conditioning regimen; Cl(T)/F decreased by 30%, suggesting drug accumulation after multiple-dose regimen. Although being lower than reported in the literature, this variation may be associated with toxicity of the proposed treatment, justifying patient monitoring and enhancing validity of previous pharmacokinetic evaluation using TD regimen.","['Effting, Cristiane', 'de Moraes Arantes, Adriano', 'Queiroz Labre, Luciana V', 'Carneiro, Wilsione J', 'de Oliveira Neto, Jeronimo R', 'Bariani, Cesar', 'Rodrigues, Caroline R', 'Rodrigues, Andryne R', 'Cunha, Luiz C']","['Effting C', 'de Moraes Arantes A', 'Queiroz Labre LV', 'Carneiro WJ', 'de Oliveira Neto JR', 'Bariani C', 'Rodrigues CR', 'Rodrigues AR', 'Cunha LC']","['*Nucleo de Estudos e Pesquisas Toxico-Farmacologicas, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania; daggerDepartamento de Farmacia, Universidade Estadual de Goias, Anapolis; and double daggerUnidade de Transplante de Medula Ossea do Hospital Araujo Jorge, Goiania, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Area Under Curve', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia/metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precision Medicine', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/FTD.0000000000000106 [doi]', '00007691-201502000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2015 Feb;37(1):66-70. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000106.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There has been remarkable progress in understanding melanoma pathogenesis in terms of genetic alterations. However, recent studies have revealed a complex involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of gene expression, including methylation, chromatin modification and remodeling, and the diverse activities of non-coding RNAs. The roles of gene methylation and miRNAs have been relatively well studied in melanoma, but other studies have shown that changes in chromatin status and in the differential expression of long non-coding RNAs can lead to altered regulation of key genes. Taken together, they affect the functioning of signaling pathways that influence each other, intersect, and form networks in which local perturbations disturb the activity of the whole system. Here, we focus on how epigenetic events intertwine with these pathways and contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of melanoma.","['Sarkar, Debina', 'Leung, Euphemia Y', 'Baguley, Bruce C', 'Finlay, Graeme J', 'Askarian-Amiri, Marjan E']","['Sarkar D', 'Leung EY', 'Baguley BC', 'Finlay GJ', 'Askarian-Amiri ME']","['a Auckland Cancer Society Research Center ; University of Auckland ; Auckland , New Zealand.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,IM,"['Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC4622872,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/10/06 06:00,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15592294.2014.1003746 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2015;10(2):103-21. doi: 10.1080/15592294.2014.1003746.,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",['NOTNLM'],"['5hmC, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine', '5mC, 5-methylcytosine', 'ACE, angiotensin converting enzyme', 'ANCR, anti-differentiation non-coding RNA', 'ANRIL, antisense noncoding RNA in INK4 locus', 'ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1', 'ATRA, all-trans retinoic acid', 'BANCR, BRAF-activated non-coding RNA', 'BCL-2, B-cell lymphoma 2', 'BRAF, B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase', 'BRG1, ATP-dependent helicase SMARCA4', 'CAF-1, chromatin assembly factor-1', 'CBX7, chromobox homolog 7', 'CCND1, cyclin D1', 'CD28, cluster of differentiation 28', 'CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase', 'CDKN2A/B, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B', 'CHD8, chromodomain-helicase DNA-binding protein 8', 'CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein', 'CUDR, cancer upregulated drug resistant', 'Cdc6, cell division cycle 6', 'DNA methylation/demethylation', 'DNMT, DNA methyltransferase', 'EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition', 'ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase', 'EZH2, enhancer of zeste homolog 2', 'GPCRs, G-protein coupled receptors', 'GSK3a, glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha', 'GWAS, genome-wide association study', 'HDAC, histone deacetylase', 'HOTAIR, HOX antisense intergenic RNA', 'IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis', 'IDH2, isocitrate dehydrogenase', 'IFN, interferon, interleukin 23', 'JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase', 'Jak/STAT, Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription', 'MAFG, v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog G', 'MALAT1, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1', 'MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase', 'MC1R, melanocortin-1 receptor', 'MGMT, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase', 'MIF, macrophage migration inhibitory factor', 'MITF, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor', 'MRE, miRNA recognition element', 'MeCP2, methyl CpG binding protein 2', 'NF-kappaB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells', 'NOD, nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain', 'PBX, pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox', 'PEDF, pigment epithelium derived factor', 'PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase', 'PIB5PA, phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-biphosphate 5-phosphatase A', 'PKA, protein kinase A', 'PRC, polycomb repressor complex', 'PSF, PTB associated splicing factor', 'PTB, polypyrimidine tract-binding', 'PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog', 'RARB, retinoic acid receptor-beta2', 'RASSF1A, Ras association domain family 1A', 'SETDB1, SET Domain, bifurcated 1', 'SPRY4, Sprouty 4', 'STAU1, Staufen1', 'SWI/SNF, SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable', 'TCR, T-cell receptor', 'TET, ten eleven translocase', 'TGF beta, transforming growth factor beta', 'TINCR, tissue differentiation-inducing non-protein coding RNA', 'TOR, target of rapamycin', 'TP53, tumor protein 53', 'TRAF6, TNF receptor-associated factor 6', 'UCA1, urothelial carcinoma-associated 1', 'ceRNA, competitive endogenous RNAs', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'epigenetics', 'gene regulation', 'lncRNA, long ncRNA', 'melanoma', 'miRNA, micro RNA', 'ncRNA, non-coding RNA', 'ncRNAs', 'p14ARF, p14 alternative reading frame', 'p16INK4a, p16 inhibitor of CDK4', 'pRB, retinoblastoma protein', 'snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA', 'alpha-MSHm, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This study was a qualitative exploratory study comprising 45 in-depth interviews with haematology patients supported by the Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland. RESULTS: The findings indicate that decentralisation of treatment is assisting haematology patients to overcome the profound difficulties associated with travelling to the metropolitan area for treatment. CONCLUSION: Fostering specialist outreach and building capacity in regional cancer centres are service delivery strategies that are greatly appreciated by regional, rural and remote haematology patients who are stressed by the many challenges associated with leaving home to travel distances for specialist treatment. It is the hope and expectation that these findings will make a contribution to informing future health policy and service delivery planning.","['McGrath, Pam']",['McGrath P'],,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Aust Health Rev,Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,8214381,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Health Services Accessibility', 'Hematologic Diseases/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Qualitative Research', 'Queensland', 'Travel/*economics/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2016/01/15 06:00,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2014/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['AH14147 [pii]', '10.1071/AH14147 [doi]']",ppublish,Aust Health Rev. 2015 Jun;39(3):344-350. doi: 10.1071/AH14147.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Continuous infusion of doxorubicin is as effective as bolus administration in leukemia treatment, but no evidence has indicated that it provides long-term cardioprotection; continuous infusions should be eliminated from pediatric cancer treatment. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can delay the progression of subclinical and clinical cardiotoxicity. All survivors, regardless of whether they were treated with anthracyclines or radiation, should be monitored for systemic inflammation and the risk of premature cardiovascular disease. Echocardiographic screening must be supplemented with screening for biomarkers of cardiotoxicity and perhaps by identification of genetic susceptibilities to cardiovascular diseases; optimal strategies need to be identified.

These studies have been investigated by utilizing the electronic absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectra and ethidium bromide (EBr) displacement and gel filtration techniques. a-d complexes cooperatively bind and denature the DNA at low concentrations. Their concentration at midpoint of transition, L1/2, follows the order a >> b > c > d. Also the g, the number of binding sites per 1000 nucleotides, follows the order a >> b ~ c > d. EBr and Scatchard experiments for a-d complexes suggest efficient intercalative binding affinity to CT-DNA giving the order: d > c > b > a. Several binding and thermodynamic parameters are also described. The biological activity of these cationic and water soluble palladium complexes were tested against chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, K562. b, c and d complexes show cytotoxic concentration (Cc50) values much lower than cisplatin.","['Shahraki, Somaye', 'Mansouri-Torshizi, Hassan', 'Sori Nezami, Ziba', 'Ghahghaei, Arezou', 'Yaghoubi, Fatemeh', 'Divsalar, Adeleh', 'Saboury, Ali-Akbar', 'H Shirazi, Farshad']","['Shahraki S', 'Mansouri-Torshizi H', 'Sori Nezami Z', 'Ghahghaei A', 'Yaghoubi F', 'Divsalar A', 'Saboury AA', 'H Shirazi F']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Sistan & Baluchestan, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Sistan & Baluchestan, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Sistan & Baluchestan, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, University of Sistan & Baluchestan, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Sistan & Baluchestan, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Tarbiat Moallem University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shahid Behesthi University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Pharm Res,Iranian journal of pharmaceutical research : IJPR,101208407,,,PMC4232794,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/01/15 06:01,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/15 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Pharm Res. 2014 Fall;13(4):1279-94.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytotoxicity', 'DNA binding', 'Pd(II) complexes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Empirical antifungal agents are used to reduce their consequences. Caspofungin is the only echinocandin approved for this indication. Micafungin was compared with caspofungin for the treatment of patients with hematological malignancies and prolonged neutropenia. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted involving patients who had hematological malignancies with profound neutropenia for a minimum of 10 days, and received empirical micafungin or caspofungin for a minimum of five days, between April 2005 and November 2009. Successful outcome was based on a composite end point: survival for a minimum of seven days following antifungal cessation, successful treatment of baseline fungal infection, absence of adverse events and absence of breakthrough fungal infection. Fungal infections were defined according to revised definitions of invasive fungal disease from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC-MSG) criteria, with modification of the diagnostic imaging criteria. RESULTS: Micafungin had similar overall success to caspofungin (60.4% [29 of 48] versus 57.3% [47 of 82], respectively; P=0.729). Survival was higher in the micafungin group compared with the caspofungin group (100% [48 of 48] versus 89% [73 of 82]; P=0.02). No baseline invasive fungal infections were identified in the micafungin group, compared with three proven infections treated successfully with caspofungin (3.7%; P=0.18). Three proven breakthrough infections were observed in the micafungin group (three of 48 [27.3%]) compared with none in the caspofungin group (zero of 82; P=0.02). CONCLUSION: Micafungin has similar efficacy to caspofungin as empirical antifungal therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies. Verification of these results in a prospective trial is warranted.","['Shalhoub, Sarah', 'Wang, Luchen', 'Ching, Arthur', 'Husain, Shahid', 'Rotstein, Coleman']","['Shalhoub S', 'Wang L', 'Ching A', 'Husain S', 'Rotstein C']","['Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases Service, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario.', 'Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases Service, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario.', 'Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases Service, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario.', 'Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases Service, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario.', 'Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases Service, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Egypt,Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol,The Canadian journal of infectious diseases & medical microbiology = Journal canadien des maladies infectieuses et de la microbiologie medicale,101226876,,,PMC4277157,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/01/15 06:01,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2014/983724 [doi]'],ppublish,Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol. 2014 Nov-Dec;25(6):299-304. doi: 10.1155/2014/983724.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Echinocandins', 'Fungal', 'Infection', 'Leukemia', 'Neutropenia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all, 522 patients age 15 to 55 years old and presenting with at least 1 conventional high-risk factor were candidates for SCT in first complete remission. Among these, 282 (54%) received a transplant in first complete remission. At 3 years, posttransplant cumulative incidences of relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and relapse-free survival (RFS) were estimated at 19.5%, 15.5%, and 64.7%, respectively. Time-dependent analysis did not reveal a significant difference in RFS between SCT and no-SCT cohorts. However, SCT was associated with longer RFS in patients with postinduction minimal residual disease (MRD) >/=10(-3) (hazard ratio, 0.40) but not in good MRD responders. In B-cell precursor ALL, SCT also benefitted patients with focal IKZF1 gene deletion (hazard ratio, 0.42). This article shows that poor early MRD response, in contrast to conventional ALL risk factors, is an excellent tool to identify patients who may benefit from allogeneic SCT in the context of intensified adult ALL therapy.

Proteomics analysis showed that the SH2 domains of Src family kinases are themselves tyrosine phosphorylated in blood system cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. Using the Src family kinase Lyn SH2 domain as a model, we found that phosphorylation at the conserved SH2 domain residue Y(194) impacts the affinity and specificity of SH2 domain binding to pY-containing peptides and proteins. Analysis of the Lyn SH2 domain crystal structure supports a model wherein phosphorylation of Y(194) on the EF loop modulates the binding pocket that engages amino acid side chains at the pY+2/+3 position. These data indicate another level of regulation wherein SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions are modulated by SH2 kinases and phosphatases.","['Jin, Lily L', 'Wybenga-Groot, Leanne E', 'Tong, Jiefei', 'Taylor, Paul', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Trudel, Suzanne', 'McGlade, C Jane', 'Moran, Michael F']","['Jin LL', 'Wybenga-Groot LE', 'Tong J', 'Taylor P', 'Minden MD', 'Trudel S', 'McGlade CJ', 'Moran MF']","[""From the double daggerMolecular Structure and Function, The Hospital For Sick Children, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, M5G 0A4, Canada; double daggerdouble daggerDepartments of Molecular Genetics, Medical Science Building, Room 4386, 1 King's College Circle, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada;"", 'section signCell Biology, The Hospital For Sick Children, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, M5G 0A4, Canada; paragraph signThe Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumour Research Centre, The Hospital For Sick Children, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, M5G 0A4, Canada;', 'From the double daggerMolecular Structure and Function, The Hospital For Sick Children, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, M5G 0A4, Canada;', 'From the double daggerMolecular Structure and Function, The Hospital For Sick Children, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, M5G 0A4, Canada;', ""||Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Medical Science Building, Room 4386, 1 King's College Circle, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; **The Princess Margaret Cancer Center, 610 University Avenue, M5G 2M9, Toronto, Canada."", ""||Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Medical Science Building, Room 4386, 1 King's College Circle, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; **The Princess Margaret Cancer Center, 610 University Avenue, M5G 2M9, Toronto, Canada."", ""section signCell Biology, The Hospital For Sick Children, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, M5G 0A4, Canada; paragraph signThe Arthur and Sonia Labatt Brain Tumour Research Centre, The Hospital For Sick Children, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, M5G 0A4, Canada; ||Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Medical Science Building, Room 4386, 1 King's College Circle, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada;"", ""From the double daggerMolecular Structure and Function, The Hospital For Sick Children, 686 Bay Street, Toronto, M5G 0A4, Canada; double daggerdouble daggerDepartments of Molecular Genetics, Medical Science Building, Room 4386, 1 King's College Circle, Toronto, ON M5S 1A8, Canada; **The Princess Margaret Cancer Center, 610 University Avenue, M5G 2M9, Toronto, Canada m.moran@utoronto.ca.""]",['eng'],['MOP106507/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150113,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Multiple Myeloma/*enzymology', 'Phosphotyrosine/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Substrate Specificity', 'src Homology Domains', 'src-Family Kinases/*chemistry']",PMC4349988,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)33233-3 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M114.044404 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2015 Mar;14(3):695-706. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M114.044404.

Among genes involved in the TP53 pathway, we found frequent mutations in ATM (n=18), TP53 (n=10) and NOTCH1 (n=10) genes, rare mutations of NOTCH2 (n=2) and CDKN1A/p21 (n=1) and no mutations in BAX, MDM2, TNFRSF10A and TNFRSF10B genes. The in vitro treatment of primary B-CLL cells with the activator of p53 Nutlin-3 induced the transcription of p53 target genes, without significant differences between the B-CLL without mutations and those harboring either ATM or NOTCH1mutations. On the other hand, the subgroup of TP53mutated B-CLL exhibited a significantly lower induction of the p53 target genes in response to Nutlin-3 as compared to the other B-CLL samples. However, among the TP53mutated B-CLL, those showing mutations in the high hot spot region of the DNA binding domain [273-280 aa] maintained a significantly higher p53-dependent transcriptional activity as compared to the other TP53mutated B-CLL samples. Since the ability to elicit a p53-dependent transcriptional activity in vitro has a positive prognostic significance, our data suggest that ATMmutated, NOTCH1mutated and surprisingly, also a subset of TP53mutated B-CLL patients might benefit from therapeutic combinations including small molecule activator of the p53 pathway.","['Athanasakis, Emmanouil', 'Melloni, Elisabetta', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Agnoletto, Chiara', 'Voltan, Rebecca', 'Vozzi, Diego', 'Piscianz, Elisa', 'Segat, Ludovica', 'Dal Monego, Simeone', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Secchiero, Paola', 'Zauli, Giorgio']","['Athanasakis E', 'Melloni E', 'Rigolin GM', 'Agnoletto C', 'Voltan R', 'Vozzi D', 'Piscianz E', 'Segat L', 'Dal Monego S', 'Cuneo A', 'Secchiero P', 'Zauli G']","['Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS ""Burlo Garofolo"", Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery, Experimental Medicine and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara-Arcispedale S.

Flow cytometry (FCM) ranks among the most effective approaches, which allows rapid sample processing and compete successfully with highly sensitive molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction. Because FCM is ordinarily applied to detect MRD in B-lineage diseases like chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a similar method could be used in MCL. We decided to test our novel eight-color FCM approach in MCL MRD detection. METHODS: Using an eight-color FCM protocol designed by us, the expression of 24 selected surface antigens in a cohort of 30 patients with newly diagnosed leukemic MCL and 20 normal controls were compared to establish markers that can reliably distinguish normal B-lymphocytes from the MCL population. The sensitivity of the designed protocol was tested using serial dilution studies. RESULTS: Although MCL presents high immunophenotypic variability, the combination of CD20/23/5/19/200/62L/3/45 seems to be very favorable in flow cytometric MRD measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Our eight-color FCM protocol could easily detect MRD in MCL patients, and reaches a sensitivity of up to 2 x 10(-4) .","['Chovancova, Jana', 'Bernard, Tomas', 'Stehlikova, Olga', 'Salek, David', 'Janikova, Andrea', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Doubek, Michael']","['Chovancova J', 'Bernard T', 'Stehlikova O', 'Salek D', 'Janikova A', 'Mayer J', 'Doubek M']","['Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic; Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150114,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

In 1965, survival was almost zero; now 5-year survival rates exceed 80% in high-income countries. The lessons learned in the care of patients with the most common malignancy in childhood--acute lymphoblastic leukaemia--have been used in all other cancers of childhood and more recently in the management of adults. These lessons can be broadly applied in medical practice, because elements of laboratory science in all branches of pathology, as well as a deep understanding of biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, genetics and molecular science, run through this story. Far from being a sad area of practice, paediatric haematology and oncology remains the champion of embedded clinical and translational research, diagnosis from bench to bedside and lifelong multidisciplinary management of the child and their family.","['Cole, Catherine Helen']",['Cole CH'],"[""School of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia; Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Haematology and Oncology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, Australia; Heamatology Laboratory, PathWest, Perth, Western Australia, Australia; Telethon Kids' Institute, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",,Australia,J Paediatr Child Health,Journal of paediatrics and child health,9005421,IM,"['Child', 'Europe', 'Genetic Markers', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*history/therapy', 'United States']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2014/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jpc.12803 [doi]'],ppublish,J Paediatr Child Health. 2015 Jan;51(1):78-81. doi: 10.1111/jpc.12803.,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],['NOTNLM'],"['haematology', 'oncology']","['(c) 2015 The Author.

Therefore, robust biomarkers are needed to guide the development of new targeted therapy. The authors evaluated the expression of several biomarkers in pediatric intracranial ependymoma and observed that the expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a polycomb complex protein involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, was independently associated with poor survival. METHODS: Tissue microarray immunostaining was performed on 180 ependymoma samples from 12 of 16 Canadian pediatric centers. Expression levels of EZH2, Ki-67, B lymphoma Moloney-murine leukemia virus insertion region 1 homolog, tumor protein 16 (P16), Y-box binding protein 1, phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT), and epidermal growth factor receptor were evaluated. Cox regression analyses were performed, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to construct survival curves. RESULTS: EZH2 expressed in 16% of tumors was associated with inferior 5-year overall survival. Ki-67 and pAKT levels were associated with a poor outcome in patients with posterior fossa ependymoma, and the absence of P16 was associated with a poor outcome in patients with supratentorial ependymoma. Multivariate analysis revealed that younger age and EZH2 expression (95% confidence interval, 1.1-36.0) were independent markers of a poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: EZH2 is a novel, independent marker of a poor prognosis in patients with ependymoma, especially in those who have tumors located in the posterior fossa. EZH2, pAKT, and P16 are potential therapeutic targets, particularly for patients who have tumors in which standard gross total resection plus fractionated radiotherapy is not feasible.","['Li, Amanda M', 'Dunham, Christopher', 'Tabori, Uri', 'Carret, Anne-Sophie', 'McNeely, P Daniel', 'Johnston, Donna', 'Lafay-Cousin, Lucie', 'Wilson, Beverly', 'Eisenstat, David D', 'Jabado, Nada', 'Zelcer, Shayna', 'Silva, Mariana', 'Scheinemann, Katrin', 'Fryer, Christopher', 'Hendson, Glenda', 'Fotovati, Abbas', 'Hawkins, Cynthia', 'Yip, Stephen', 'Dunn, Sandra E', 'Hukin, Juliette']","['Li AM', 'Dunham C', 'Tabori U', 'Carret AS', 'McNeely PD', 'Johnston D', 'Lafay-Cousin L', 'Wilson B', 'Eisenstat DD', 'Jabado N', 'Zelcer S', 'Silva M', 'Scheinemann K', 'Fryer C', 'Hendson G', 'Fotovati A', 'Hawkins C', 'Yip S', 'Dunn SE', 'Hukin J']","['Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150113,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Ependymoma/*metabolism/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/06/27 06:00,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2014/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29198 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 May 1;121(9):1499-507. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29198.

Optimal therapeutic effects depend on a complete and sustained depletion of serum asparagine. However, pronounced interpatient variability, differences in pharmacokinetic properties between asparaginases and the formation of asparaginase antibodies make it difficult to predict the degree of asparagine depletion that will result from a given dose of asparaginase. The pharmacological principles underlying asparaginase therapy in the treatment of ALL are summarized in this article. A better understanding of the many factors that influence asparaginase activity and subsequent asparagine depletion may allow physicians to tailor treatment to the individual, maximizing therapeutic effect and minimizing treatment-related toxicity.

ZRSR2 is involved in the recognition of 3'-splice site during the early stages of spliceosome assembly; however, its precise role in RNA splicing has remained unclear. Here we characterize ZRSR2 as an essential component of the minor spliceosome (U12 dependent) assembly. shRNA-mediated knockdown of ZRSR2 leads to impaired splicing of the U12-type introns and RNA-sequencing of MDS bone marrow reveals that loss of ZRSR2 activity causes increased mis-splicing. These splicing defects involve retention of the U12-type introns, while splicing of the U2-type introns remain mostly unaffected. ZRSR2-deficient cells also exhibit reduced proliferation potential and distinct alterations in myeloid and erythroid differentiation in vitro. These data identify a specific role for ZRSR2 in RNA splicing and highlight dysregulated splicing of U12-type introns as a characteristic feature of ZRSR2 mutations in MDS.","['Madan, Vikas', 'Kanojia, Deepika', 'Li, Jia', 'Okamoto, Ryoko', 'Sato-Otsubo, Aiko', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Grossmann, Vera', 'Sundaresan, Janani', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Yang, Henry', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Madan V', 'Kanojia D', 'Li J', 'Okamoto R', 'Sato-Otsubo A', 'Kohlmann A', 'Sanada M', 'Grossmann V', 'Sundaresan J', 'Shiraishi Y', 'Miyano S', 'Thol F', 'Ganser A', 'Yang H', 'Haferlach T', 'Ogawa S', 'Koeffler HP']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, 12-01, Singapore 117599, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, 12-01, Singapore 117599, Singapore.', '1] Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, 12-01, Singapore 117599, Singapore [2] Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 119228, Singapore.', 'Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.', '1] Cancer Genomics Project, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan [2] Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, 81377 Munich, Germany.', '1] Cancer Genomics Project, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan [2] Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, 81377 Munich, Germany.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, 12-01, Singapore 117599, Singapore.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, 12-01, Singapore 117599, Singapore.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, 81377 Munich, Germany.', '1] Cancer Genomics Project, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan [2] Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', '1] Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, 12-01, Singapore 117599, Singapore [2] Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA [3] National University Cancer Institute, National University Hospital Singapore, Singapore 119228, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA026038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA026038-33/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150114,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*RNA, Small Nuclear', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Spliceosomes']",PMC4349895,['NIHMS647095'],2015/01/15 06:00,2016/02/09 06:00,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2014/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms7042 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms7042 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2015 Jan 14;6:6042. doi: 10.1038/ncomms7042.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Nuclear)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (U12 small nuclear RNA)', '0 (ZRSR2 protein, human)']",,,,,,['GEO/GSE63816'],,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty participants (aged 3-13), divided into the leukaemia group (LG) and healthy group (HG), were evaluated. Collection of medical data, intraoral examination and collection of clinical specimens were carried out. Single PCR and nested-PCR techniques were used to identify the viral types; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR techniques were used to evaluate the profile and abundance of bacterial communities. RESULTS: All the children with leukaemia were positive for at least one type of herpesvirus, compared with healthy participants (33.3%; p<0.000). Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV; 46.7%), human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7; 20%) and HHV-8 (77.3%) were in higher prevalence in the LG (p </= 0.01). Children with leukaemia had positive associations with the presence of HCMV, HHV-7 and HHV-8 in the oral cavity when under chemotherapy (p<0.05). There was a qualitative (means of DGGE bands) and quantitative (means of 16S rRNA gene abundance) difference in relation to the bacterial community between the two groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, the prevalence of herpesviruses and the qualitative bacterial profiles was higher in children with leukaemia and HCMV, HHV-7 and HHV-8 were related to the use of chemotherapy. Moreover, HHV-6 was correlated with an increased bacterial community profile in patients with leukaemia (p<0.05).

The ATP-binding cassette is involved in drug metabolism, and the polymorphism of this gene may be an important risk factor in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) or progression and/or response to chemotherapy agents. For the first time, the present study was aimed to evaluate the probable effects of ABCB1 T3435C polymorphism on clinical and laboratory features of Kurdish patients with B-CLL. This descriptive analytical case-control study was performed on 50 B-CLL patients and 100 healthy subjects. Serum levels of beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and blood WBC, RBC, Plt and ESR were measured. The T3435C polymorphism of the ABCB1 gene was determined by PCR-RFLP. Concentration of serum and blood markers was significantly higher in the malignant group than in the benign subjects. The CC genotype had the highest frequency (66%) in the patient groups. There are no significant differences between the genotypes and type of treatment. Our results demonstrate the high frequency of C allele of ABCB1 T3435C in B-CLL patients with Kurdish ethnicity. We also show that this polymorphism has a significant risk factor in B-CLL.

It is available in the EU and the USA as combination therapy with oral chlorambucil in adults with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). In a multinational phase III study in this patient population, obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with oral chlorambucil alone and intravenous rituximab plus oral chlorambucil. Significant advantages with obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil over chlorambucil alone and rituximab plus chlorambucil were also observed in event-free survival, the time to a new anti-leukaemia treatment and overall response. The overall survival benefit with obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil is as yet unclear, although the most recent analysis suggests a benefit over chlorambucil alone. In the phase III study, obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil had a manageable tolerability profile in accordance with what would be expected for an anti-CD20 antibody.

In the majority of patients, infusion-related reactions were mild to moderate in severity and occurred predominantly during the first infusion and were managed by slowing or temporarily halting the infusion. Thus, current evidence suggests that obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil is a welcome addition to the treatment options currently available for adults with previously untreated CLL and is recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines as the preferred first option for some, including those with comorbidities.","['Hoy, Sheridan M']",['Hoy SM'],"['Springer, Private Bag 65901, Mairangi Bay 0754, Auckland, New Zealand, demail@springer.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40265-014-0340-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 2015 Feb;75(3):285-96. doi: 10.1007/s40265-014-0340-3.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'O43472U9X8 (obinutuzumab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, studies have relied on questionnaires or chart abstraction. We aimed to construct and validate a diagnostic interval measure using health services data among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in order to determine predictors of prolonged intervals and associations with event-free survival (EFS). PROCEDURE: All children with ALL diagnosed 1995-2011 (N = 1,541) in Ontario, Canada were linked to population-based health administrative databases. Healthcare claims prior to diagnosis were used to define healthcare episodes. Diagnostic intervals (time between first episode with diagnostic code a priori classified as consistent with underlying ALL, and diagnosis) were validated by correlation with a chart abstraction-based measure. RESULTS: Intervals were generally short (median 2 days, IQR 1-3). Predictors of longer intervals included having general primary care physicians versus pediatricians (odds ratio 1.60, 95%CI 1.04-2.47; P = 0.03). While prolonged diagnostic intervals were associated with superior EFS (hazard ratio 0.71, 95%CI 0.52-0.98; P = 0.04), this was explained by confounding by disease biology. CONCLUSIONS: Health administrative data can be used to measure diagnostic intervals in ALL and potentially other pediatric malignant and non-malignant diseases. Diagnostic intervals were short and a marker of disease severity rather than independent predictors of outcome. These findings may be used to address caregiver guilt and caution against ""early diagnosis"" benchmarks not based in evidence. Future studies should examine the impact of diagnostic interval length in other conditions, but should account for potential confounding by disease severity.","['Gupta, Sumit', 'Gibson, Paul', 'Pole, Jason D', 'Sutradhar, Rinku', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Guttmann, Astrid']","['Gupta S', 'Gibson P', 'Pole JD', 'Sutradhar R', 'Sung L', 'Guttmann A']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology and Program in Child Health Evaluative Sciences, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150113,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Time Factors']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/07/23 06:00,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2014/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25402 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jun;62(6):957-63. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25402.

METHODS: The final analysis, with 24 months of follow-up, included additional efficacy and safety analyses to assess the benefit of long-term omacetaxine administration (1.25 mg/m(2) twice daily for 14 days every 28 days followed by 7 days every 28 days) in CP-CML and AP-CML patients receiving >3 cycles. RESULTS: Eighteen percent of CP-CML patients achieved a major cytogenetic response (MCyR) with a median duration of 12.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.5 months to not reached [NR]); responses were maintained for >/=12 months in 3 of 14 responders, and the median overall survival (OS) was 40.3 months (95% CI, 23.8 months to NR). Among patients with AP-CML, 14% achieved or maintained a major hematologic response for a median of 4.7 months (95% CI, 3.6 months to NR); MCyR was not achieved, and the median OS was 14.3 months (95% CI, 6.7-18.7 months). In patients with CP-CML and patients with AP-CML who received >3 cycles of treatment (n = 50 and n = 14, respectively), the median OS was 49.3 months (95% CI, 23.8 months to NR) and 24.6 months (95% CI, 12-37.2 months), respectively. Grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicities were the major side effects (79% and 73% for CP-CML and AP-CML, respectively), with discontinuation due to toxicity in 10% of CP patients and in 5% of AP patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the long-term administration of omacetaxine is feasible with dose adjustments to manage toxicities and that omacetaxine provides a durable benefit for some patients.","['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Rea, Delphine', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Akard, Luke', 'Khoury, H Jean', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Guerci-Bresler, Agnes', 'Chuah, Charles', 'Hellmann, Andrzej', 'Digumarti, Raghunadharao', 'Parikh, Purvish M', 'Legros, Laurence', 'Warzocha, Krzysztof', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Li, Elizabeth', 'Munteanu, Mihaela', 'Nicolini, Franck E']","['Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Rea D', 'Wetzler M', 'Lipton JH', 'Akard L', 'Khoury HJ', 'Michallet M', 'Guerci-Bresler A', 'Chuah C', 'Hellmann A', 'Digumarti R', 'Parikh PM', 'Legros L', 'Warzocha K', 'Baccarani M', 'Li E', 'Munteanu M', 'Nicolini FE']","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150113,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Harringtonines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC5650096,['NIHMS883181'],2015/01/15 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2014/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29240 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 May 15;121(10):1637-44. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29240.

Mice received anti-ADAM8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) of 100 mug/100 mul, 200 mug/100 mul or 300 mug/100 mul, respectively, in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS intervention during the progression of HCC induced by diethylnitrosamine. The survival rate, body weight, and relative liver weight were determined in the mice. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, hematoxylin-eosin staining, the expression level of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), caspase 3 (Casp3), B cell leukemia 2 (Bcl2), B cell leukemia 2-associated X protein (Bax), protein p53 (P53), and ADAM8 were detected in the mice at the end of the 24th week. Our results showed that anti-ADAM8 mAb intervention effectively improved the survival rate, reduced the body weight loss and increased the relative liver weight in mice in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Anti-ADAM8 mAb intervention also significantly lowered serum AST, ALT, and AFP levels (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), slowed the progression of HCC (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), induced the expression of Casp3, Bax, and P53 (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), and inhibited the expression of VEGF-A, PCNA, and Bcl2 in the liver of mice (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner compared with the mice receiving PBS intervention. Our study suggested that ADAM8 might promote the progression of HCC by regulating the expression of these factors. Anti-ADAM8 mAb intervention might be suitable as a potential method for HCC therapy.","['Li, S-Q', 'Wang, D-M', 'Zhu, S', 'Ma, Z', 'Li, R-F', 'Xu, Z-S', 'Han, H-M']","['Li SQ', 'Wang DM', 'Zhu S', 'Ma Z', 'Li RF', 'Xu ZS', 'Han HM']","[""The Molecular Medicine Key Laboratory of Liver Injury and Repair, Medical College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, People's Republic of China sanqiangli2001@163.com."", ""The Molecular Medicine Key Laboratory of Liver Injury and Repair, Medical College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Microbiology Immunology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, People's Republic of China."", ""The Molecular Medicine Key Laboratory of Liver Injury and Repair, Medical College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, People's Republic of China."", ""The Molecular Medicine Key Laboratory of Liver Injury and Repair, Medical College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, People's Republic of China."", ""The Molecular Medicine Key Laboratory of Liver Injury and Repair, Medical College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, People's Republic of China."", ""The Molecular Medicine Key Laboratory of Liver Injury and Repair, Medical College, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150113,England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,IM,"['ADAM Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/*metabolism', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism/pathology', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Diethylnitrosamine', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics/metabolism', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/analysis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2015/01/15 06:00'],"['2015/01/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['0960327114567767 [pii]', '10.1177/0960327114567767 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 2015 Nov;34(11):1053-72. doi: 10.1177/0960327114567767.

Aberrations in HOXA genes and their cofactor MEIS1 are found in human neoplasms, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The present study investigated the role of HOXA4, HOXA5 and MEIS1 promoter DNA methylation and mRNA expression in AML. Samples from 78 AML patients and 12 normal bone marrow (BM) samples were included. The levels of promoter DNA methylation were determined using quantitative methylationspecific polymerase chain reaction (PCR; qMSP) and the relative expression levels were measured using reverse transcription quantitative PCR in Ficollseparated BM mononuclear cells and in fluorescent activated cell sortingsorted populations of normal hematopoietic progenitors. In total, 38.1 and 28.9% of the patients exhibited high methylation levels of HOXA4 and HOXA5, respectively, compared with the control samples, and MEIS1 methylation was almost absent. An inverse correlation between HOXA4 methylation and expression was identified in a group of patients with a normal karyotype (NK AML). An association between the genes was observed and correlation between the DNA methylation and expression levels of the HOXA gene promoter with the expression of MEIS1 was observed. Patients with favorable chromosomal aberrations revealed a low level of HOXA4 methylation and decreased expression levels of HOXA5 and MEIS1 compared with the NK AML and the adverse cytogenetic risk patients. The NK AML patients with NPM1 mutations exhibited elevated HOXA4 methylation and expression levels of HOXA5 and MEIS1 compared with the NPM1 wildtype patients. Comparison of the undifferentiated BMderived hematopoietic CD34+CD38low, CD34+CD38+ and CD15+ cells revealed a gradual decrease in the expression levels of these three genes and an increase in HOXA4 promoter methylation.

We found that HO-1 was resistant to 5-azacytidine (AZA) treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and explored further the relative mechanisms. Patient bone marrow mononuclear cells (n=48) diagnosed as different levels of MDS were collected. Cell growth was evaluated by MTT assay; cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry; mRNA expression was assessed by real-time PCR, protein expression was analyzed through western blotting. Methylation was assessed by MSP. The survival time, and weight of mice were recorded. HO-1 overexpression was observed in SKM-1 cells after AZA treatment comparing to other cell lines. The HO-1 expression in MDS patients with high-risk was higher than in low-risk patients. After HO-1 was silenced by lentivirus-mediated siRNA, the proliferation of SKM-1 cells was effectively inhibited by low concentration AZA, and the cell cycle was arrested in the G0/G1 phase. Upregulation of p16 and changing of p16-relative cell cycle protein was observed after silencing HO-1 in AZA treated SKM-1 cells. In addition, DNMT1 was downregulated following the decrease of HO-1 expression. In vivo, silencing HO-1 inhibited SKM-1 cell growth induced by AZA in a NOD/SCID mouse model. Silencing HO-1 sensitized SKM-1 cells toward AZA, which may be attributed to the influence of HO-1 on AZA-induced p16 demethylation. HO-1 may be one of the targets that enhance the therapeutic effects of AZA on MDS malignant transformation inspiring new treatment methods for high-risk and very high-risk MDS patients in clinical practice.","['Wang, Ping', 'Ma, Dan', 'Wang, Jishi', 'Fang, Qin', 'Gao, Rui', 'Wu, Weibing', 'Lu, Tangsheng', 'Cao, Lu']","['Wang P', 'Ma D', 'Wang J', 'Fang Q', 'Gao R', 'Wu W', 'Lu T', 'Cao L']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550004, P.R.

Given the importance of Notch signaling in thymocyte development and T-ALL disease progression, we hypothesized that the activated AHR potentiates disease initiation and progression in an in vivo model of Notch1-induced thymoma. This hypothesis was tested utilizing adult and developmental exposure paradigms to TCDD in mice expressing a constitutively active Notch1 transgene (Notch(ICN-TG)). Following exposure of adult Notch(ICN-TG) mice to a single high dose of TCDD, we observed a significant increase in the efficiency of CD8 thymocyte generation. We next exposed pregnant mice to 3mug/kg of TCDD throughout gestation and lactation to elucidate effects of developmental AHR activation on later-life T cell development and T-ALL-like thymoma susceptibility induced by Notch1. We found that the vehicle-exposed Notch(ICN-TG) offspring have a peripheral T cell pool heavily biased toward the CD4 lineage, while TCDD-exposed Notch(ICN-TG) offspring were biased toward the CD8 lineage. Furthermore, while the vehicle-exposed NotchICN-TG mice showed increased splenomegaly and B to T cell ratios indicative of disease, mice developmentally exposed to TCDD were largely protected from disease. These studies support a model where developmental AHR activation attenuates later-life Notch1-dependent impacts on thymocyte development and disease progression.","['Ahrenhoerster, Lori S', 'Leuthner, Tess C', 'Tate, Everett R', 'Lakatos, Peter A', 'Laiosa, Michael D']","['Ahrenhoerster LS', 'Leuthner TC', 'Tate ER', 'Lakatos PA', 'Laiosa MD']","['Joseph J.

In ovarian carcinoma, we previously demonstrated that Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 cooperate to protect cancer cells against apoptosis and their concomitant inhibition leads to massive apoptosis even in the absence of chemotherapy. Whereas Bcl-xL inhibitors are now available, Mcl-1 inhibition, required to sensitize cells to Bcl-xL-targeting strategies, remains problematic. In this context, we designed and synthesized oligopyridines potentially targeting the Mcl-1 hydrophobic pocket, evaluated their capacity to inhibit Mcl-1 in live cells, and implemented a functional screening assay to evaluate their ability to sensitize ovarian carcinoma cells to Bcl-xL-targeting strategies. We established structure-activity relationships and focused our attention on MR29072, named Pyridoclax. Surface plasmon resonance assay demonstrated that pyridoclax directly binds to Mcl-1. Without cytotoxic activity when administered as a single agent, pyridoclax induced apoptosis in combination with Bcl-xL-targeting siRNA or with ABT-737 in ovarian, lung, and mesothelioma cancer cells.","['Gloaguen, Celine', 'Voisin-Chiret, Anne Sophie', 'Sopkova-de Oliveira Santos, Jana', 'Fogha, Jade', 'Gautier, Fabien', 'De Giorgi, Marcella', 'Burzicki, Gregory', 'Perato, Serge', 'Petigny-Lechartier, Cecile', 'Simonin-Le Jeune, Karin', 'Brotin, Emilie', 'Goux, Didier', ""N'Diaye, Monique"", 'Lambert, Bernard', 'Louis, Marie-Helene', 'Ligat, Laetitia', 'Lopez, Frederic', 'Juin, Philippe', 'Bureau, Ronan', 'Rault, Sylvain', 'Poulain, Laurent']","['Gloaguen C', 'Voisin-Chiret AS', 'Sopkova-de Oliveira Santos J', 'Fogha J', 'Gautier F', 'De Giorgi M', 'Burzicki G', 'Perato S', 'Petigny-Lechartier C', 'Simonin-Le Jeune K', 'Brotin E', 'Goux D', ""N'Diaye M"", 'Lambert B', 'Louis MH', 'Ligat L', 'Lopez F', 'Juin P', 'Bureau R', 'Rault S', 'Poulain L']","['Normandie Universite , 14032 Caen, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150204,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Pyridines/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Quantum Theory', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/05/08 06:00,['2015/01/14 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/jm500672y [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2015 Feb 26;58(4):1644-68. doi: 10.1021/jm500672y.

The final compounds 5a-j were screened at 10 microM against over 60 tumor cell lines at the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI). In light of the NCI results, compounds 5c and 5h showed a broad spectrum of activity against NCI cell lines with mean growth of 53% and 58%, respectively. Compound 5e behaved differently as it showed high degree of selectivity and potency by inhibiting 96% of growth of leukemia SR cell line at 10 microM. Standard COMPARE analyses were performed at the GI50 level and the results exhibit high correlation in the form of pairwise correlation coefficient (PCC) of more than 0.6 between three of the current compounds and three standard known anticancer agents. Compound 5e demonstrated high correlation levels with merbarone (NSC S336628) with a PCC value of 0.631. Compound 5h showed a considerably high PCC value of 0.626 with dichloroallyl lawsone, while compound 5i, showed PCC values of 0.601 and 0.604 with both dichloroallyl lawsone and N,N-dibenzyldaunomycin (NSC S268242), respectively.

However, this test has relatively poor sensitivity and specificity for classifying patients likely to have long-term cure or even patients who will need additional therapy to achieve complete remission. Several new methods of assessing response are being studied and are summarized in this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Many new methods are being used to evaluate response assessment. Emerging data suggest that various types of clinical, chemical, and imaging biomarkers, as well as more sensitive techniques to measure minimal residual disease, can all help provide more accurate response assessment and prognostic information. SUMMARY: New techniques will improve the way we assess response to acute myeloid leukemia therapy. Larger confirmatory studies utilizing these novel markers of response to change treatment and to improve clinical outcomes are urgently needed.","['Hall, Aric C', 'Mattison, Ryan James']","['Hall AC', 'Mattison RJ']","['Section of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Carbone Comprehensive Cancer Center, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.']",['eng'],['T32 HL007899/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Diagnostic Imaging/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,['2015/01/14 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000118 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2015 Mar;22(2):132-8. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000118.,['0 (Biomarkers)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, circulating microRNAs in body fluids have been proposed as new biomarkers. We investigated the expression of matched cellular and serum circulating microRNA-150 by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) from purified CD19(+) cells or from CLL serums obtained at diagnosis in a cohort of 273/252 CLL patients with a median follow-up of 78 months (range 7-380) and correlated it to other biological or clinical parameters. We showed that miR-150 was significantly overexpressed in CLL cells/serums compared with healthy subjects (P < 0.0001). Among CLL patients, a low cellular miR-150 expression level was associated with tumor burden, disease aggressiveness and poor prognostic factors. In contrast, a high level of serum miR-150 was associated with tumor burden markers and some markers of poor prognosis. Similarly, cellular and serum miR-150 also predicted treatment-free survival (TFS) and overall survival (OS) in an opposite manner: patients with low cellular/serum miR-150 levels have median TFS of 40/111 months compared with high-level patients who have a median TFS of 122/60 months (P < 0.0001/P = 0.0066). Similar results were observed for OS. We also found that cellular and serum miR-150 levels vary in an opposite manner during disease progression and that cellular miR-150 could be regulated by its release into the extracellular space. Cellular and serum levels of miR-150 are associated with opposite clinical prognoses and could be used to molecularly monitor disease evolution as a new prognostic factor in CLL.","['Stamatopoulos, Basile', 'Van Damme, Michael', 'Crompot, Emerence', 'Dessars, Barbara', 'Housni, Hakim El', 'Mineur, Philippe', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'Bron, Dominique', 'Lagneaux, Laurence']","['Stamatopoulos B', 'Van Damme M', 'Crompot E', 'Dessars B', 'Housni HE', 'Mineur P', 'Meuleman N', 'Bron D', 'Lagneaux L']","['Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Genetics, Erasme Hospital, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Genetics, Erasme Hospital, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Grand Hopital de Charleroi, Gilly, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150109,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Exosomes/metabolism', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Lymphocytosis/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/blood/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Tumor Burden']",PMC4461585,,2015/01/15 06:00,2016/03/29 06:00,['2015/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2014.00214 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2014.00214 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Med. 2015 Jan 9;21:123-33. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2014.00214.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN150 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated farm characteristics, allergic symptoms and conditions, and risk of NHL including specific subtypes in the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective cohort of farmers and spouses from North Carolina and Iowa. METHODS: We identified 710 incident cases of NHL (including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma) among 82,370 participants with baseline data on crop and animal exposures, including 454 cases among 52,850 participants with baseline data on recent allergy symptoms (rhinitis) and living on a farm during childhood. HR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using multivariable-adjusted proportional hazards models. RESULTS: We observed reduced risks of NHL among farmers and spouses with rhinitis at baseline (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.51-0.79), related to growing soybeans (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67-0.96), and among farmers who handled stored grains or hay (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52-0.82). Growing up on a farm was associated with increased NHL risk (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.15-1.98). Results did not differ significantly by NHL subtype. CONCLUSIONS: Both the reduced risk of NHL among those with allergy symptoms and specific farm exposures in adulthood, and the increased risk among those who grew up on a farm suggest that the host immune response to agricultural allergens may influence NHL development. IMPACT: This prospective study is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate the relationship between allergy symptoms and NHL risk in farmers; confirmation of these findings in other farming populations is warranted.

Although Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend yearly vaccination in these patients, in our large academic center, <60% of oncology patients receiving chemotherapy were immunized at baseline. Our objective was to increase this rate through a multifaceted quality improvement initiative. METHODS: Eligible patients were >6 months old, within 1 year of receiving chemotherapy, >100 days from stem cell transplant, and had >/= 1 outpatient oncology visit between September 1, 2012, and March 31, 2013. Five interventions were instituted concomitantly: (1) family education: influenza/vaccine handouts were provided to families in clinic waiting rooms; (2) health informatics: daily lists of outpatients due for immunization were generated from the electronic medical record and sent automatically to triage staff and nurses; (3) outpatient clinic: patients due for vaccination were given colored wristbands during triage to alert providers; (4) inpatient: vaccine order was built into admission order set; and (5) provider education: staff education was provided at conferences on screening of patients, vaccine ordering, and documentation of refusals/contraindications. RESULTS: The complete influenza immunization rate increased by 20.1% to 64.5%, and the proportion of patients receiving >/= 1 dose of vaccination increased by 22.9% to 77.7%. Similar changes were noted across all cancer types, with highest rates of immunization in leukemia/lymphoma patients (86.8%) and lowest in patients after stem cell transplant (66.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Technology, education, and multidisciplinary clinical process changes increased influenza vaccination rates. Ongoing efforts are targeting subgroups with lowest rates of immunization.","['Freedman, Jason L', 'Reilly, Anne F', 'Powell, Stephanie C', 'Bailey, L Charles']","['Freedman JL', 'Reilly AF', 'Powell SC', 'Bailey LC']","['Division of Oncology, and freedmanj@email.chop.edu.', 'Division of Oncology, and Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Department of Nursing, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and."", 'Division of Oncology, and Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150112,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cooperative Behavior', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Secondary', 'Influenza Vaccines/*immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Influenza, Human/complications/*immunology/*prevention & control', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/*therapy', 'Parents/education', 'Quality Improvement/*organization & administration']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/03/27 06:00,['2015/01/14 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2014-0943 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2014-0943 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2015 Feb;135(2):e540-6. doi: 10.1542/peds.2014-0943.

The intrinsic graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect, however, is the desirable curative benefit. Patients with acute GvHD are treated with cyclosporine A (CsA) or tacrolimus (FK506), which not only often causes severe adverse effects, but also interferes with the anticipated GvL. Both drugs inhibit calcineurin, thus at first suppressing activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Therefore, we explored the specific contribution of individual NFAT factors in donor T cells in animal models of GvHD and GvL. Ablation of NFAT1, NFAT2, or a combination of both resulted in ameliorated GvHD, due to reduced proliferation, target tissue homing, and impaired effector function of allogenic donor T cells. In contrast, the frequency of Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells was increased and NFAT-deficient Tregs were fully protective in GvHD. CD8(+) T-cell recall response and, importantly, the beneficial antitumor activity were largely preserved in NFAT-deficient effector T cells. Thus, specific inhibition of NFAT opens an avenue for an advanced therapy of GvHD maintaining protective GvL.","['Vaeth, Martin', 'Bauerlein, Carina A', 'Pusch, Tobias', 'Findeis, Janina', 'Chopra, Martin', 'Mottok, Anja', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Beilhack, Andreas', 'Berberich-Siebelt, Friederike']","['Vaeth M', 'Bauerlein CA', 'Pusch T', 'Findeis J', 'Chopra M', 'Mottok A', 'Rosenwald A', 'Beilhack A', 'Berberich-Siebelt F']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, Institute of Pathology, and.', 'Department of Medicine II and Center for Interdisciplinary Clinical Research, University Hospital Wurzburg, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Institute of Pathology, and.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Institute of Pathology, and.', 'Department of Medicine II and Center for Interdisciplinary Clinical Research, University Hospital Wurzburg, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, and.', 'Institute of Pathology, and Center for Interdisciplinary Clinical Research, University Hospital Wurzburg, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, Julius Maximilian University of Wurzburg, 97080 Wurzburg, Germany; and.', 'Department of Medicine II and Center for Interdisciplinary Clinical Research, University Hospital Wurzburg, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, Julius Maximilian University of Wurzburg, 97080 Wurzburg, Germany; and.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Institute of Pathology, and Center for Interdisciplinary Clinical Research, University Hospital Wurzburg, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, Julius Maximilian University of Wurzburg, 97080 Wurzburg, Germany; and path230@mail.uni-wuerzburg.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150112,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Allografts', 'Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Calcineurin Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/pathology', 'Tacrolimus/pharmacology']",PMC4313840,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/04/24 06:00,['2015/01/14 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1409290112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1409290112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Jan 27;112(4):1125-30. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1409290112.

The HiC subtype of intratumoral heterogeneity was associated with older age, TP53 (tumor protein P53) mutation, enriched C > G transition, and significantly shorter survival, whereas the LoC subtype was associated with younger age, ARID1A (AT rich interactive domain 1A) mutation, and significantly longer survival. Phylogenetic tree analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from multiple samples of two patients supported the clonal evolution of GC metastasis and revealed the accumulation of genetic defects that necessitate combination therapeutics. The most recurrently mutated genes, which were validated in a separate cohort of 216 cases by targeted sequencing, were members of the homologous recombination DNA repair, Wnt, and PI3K-ERBB pathways. Notably, the drugable NRG1 (neuregulin-1) and ERBB4 (V-Erb-B2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4) ligand-receptor pair were mutated in 10% of GC cases. Mutations of the BRCA2 (breast cancer 2, early onset) gene, found in 8% of our cohort and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas GC cohort, were associated with significantly longer survivals. These data define distinct clinicogenetic forms of GC in the Chinese population that are characterized by specific mutation sets that can be investigated for efficacy of single and combination therapies.","['Chen, Kexin', 'Yang, Da', 'Li, Xiangchun', 'Sun, Baocun', 'Song, Fengju', 'Cao, Wenfeng', 'Brat, Daniel J', 'Gao, Zhibo', 'Li, Haixin', 'Liang, Han', 'Zhao, Yanrui', 'Zheng, Hong', 'Li, Miao', 'Buckner, Jan', 'Patterson, Scott D', 'Ye, Xiang', 'Reinhard, Christoph', 'Bhathena, Anahita', 'Joshi, Deepa', 'Mischel, Paul S', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Wang, Yi Michael', 'Raghavakaimal, Sreekumar', 'Li, Hui', 'Lu, Xin', 'Pan, Yang', 'Chang, Han', 'Ba, Sujuan', 'Luo, Longhai', 'Cavenee, Webster K', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Hao, Xishan']","['Chen K', 'Yang D', 'Li X', 'Sun B', 'Song F', 'Cao W', 'Brat DJ', 'Gao Z', 'Li H', 'Liang H', 'Zhao Y', 'Zheng H', 'Li M', 'Buckner J', 'Patterson SD', 'Ye X', 'Reinhard C', 'Bhathena A', 'Joshi D', 'Mischel PS', 'Croce CM', 'Wang YM', 'Raghavakaimal S', 'Li H', 'Lu X', 'Pan Y', 'Chang H', 'Ba S', 'Luo L', 'Cavenee WK', 'Zhang W', 'Hao X']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Informatics Center, Houston, TX 77030;

Several clinical trials were performed to assess the efficiency of rATG as a first-line therapy for AA patients; however, their results were variable. The aim of the present study was to assess hematologic response and survival in severe AA (SAA) and very severe AA (VSAA) patients treated with rATG and cyclosporin A (CsA) in our center. The factors involved in these outcomes were also explored. A total of 292 patients with newly diagnosed, acquired SAA or VSAA received a combination of rATG and CsA as first-line therapy, and the results were retrospectively assessed. The median age was 18 years (range = 2-73 years). The early death rate was 5.5%, and the total response rates were 49.0% (143 responders), 60.3% (176 responders), 65.8% (192 responders), and 68.5% (200 responders) at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively, after immunosuppressive therapy. In multivariate analysis, initial response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was the predictive factor for response to therapy at 12 months. Median follow-up of surviving patients was 34 months (range = 0-117 months). Five-year overall survival was 83.2%, and the 5-year, event-free survival was 67.2%. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival were neutrophil count and achievement of any response following rATG therapy. Our results indicate that rATG/CsA is a safe and effective first-line treatment for SAA/VSAA.","['Zhang, Li', 'Jing, Liping', 'Zhou, Kang', 'Wang, Huijun', 'Peng, Guangxin', 'Li, Yang', 'Li, Yuan', 'Li, Jianping', 'Ye, Lei', 'Shi, Lihui', 'Fan, Huihui', 'Zhao, Xin', 'Wang, Jianxiang', 'Zhang, Fengkui']","['Zhang L', 'Jing L', 'Zhou K', 'Wang H', 'Peng G', 'Li Y', 'Li Y', 'Li J', 'Ye L', 'Shi L', 'Fan H', 'Zhao X', 'Wang J', 'Zhang F']","['Department of Anemia Therapeutic Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Anemia Therapeutic Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Anemia Therapeutic Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Anemia Therapeutic Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Anemia Therapeutic Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Anemia Therapeutic Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Anemia Therapeutic Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Anemia Therapeutic Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Anemia Therapeutic Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Anemia Therapeutic Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Leukemia Therapeutic Centre, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Anemia Therapeutic Centre, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.

The SERs are identified from genome-wide tumor expression data with a novel method, namely SPARROW ( SPAR: se selected exp R: essi O: n regulators identified W: ith penalized regression). SPARROW uncovers a previously unknown connection between cancer expression variation and driver events, by using a novel sparse regression technique. Our results indicate that SPARROW is a powerful complementary approach to identify candidate genes containing driver events that are hard to detect from sequence data, due to a large number of passenger mutations and lack of comprehensive sequence information from a sufficiently large number of samples. SERs identified by SPARROW reveal known driver mutations in multiple human cancers, along with known cancer-associated processes and survival-associated genes, better than popular methods for inferring gene expression networks. We demonstrate that when applied to acute myeloid leukemia expression data, SPARROW identifies an apoptotic biomarker (PYCARD) for an investigational drug obatoclax. The PYCARD and obatoclax association is validated in 30 AML patient samples.","['Logsdon, Benjamin A', 'Gentles, Andrew J', 'Miller, Chris P', 'Blau, C Anthony', 'Becker, Pamela S', 'Lee, Su-In']","['Logsdon BA', 'Gentles AJ', 'Miller CP', 'Blau CA', 'Becker PS', 'Lee SI']","['Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA Sage Bionetworks, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA.', 'Center for Cancer Systems Biology, Department of Radiology, Stanford University, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Department of Medicine/Hematology, Center for Cancer Innovation, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA.', 'Department of Medicine/Hematology, Center for Cancer Innovation, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA.', 'Department of Medicine/Hematology, Center for Cancer Innovation, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA.', 'Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98195, USA suinlee@cs.washington.edu.']",['eng'],"['T32 HL 007312/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54CA1149145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20150112,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Glioblastoma/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mutation']",PMC4330344,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/06/19 06:00,['2015/01/14 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/19 06:00 [medline]']","['gku1290 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gku1290 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2015 Feb 18;43(3):1332-44. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku1290.

Thus, inhibition of STAT3 expression could be a potent therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Using several leukaemia cell lines, the effect of the hydrolysed-catalpol (H-catalpol) and hydrolysed-aucubin (H-aucubin) products on the STAT3 signalling pathway, inhibition of BCR-ABL activation, cellular proliferation and potentiation of imatinib mesylate-induced apoptosis was investigated. We found that iridoid glycosides (catalpol and aucubin) did not exert any cytotoxicity in the tumour cells, whereas both H-catalpol and H-aucubin exhibited significant cytotoxic effects on K562 human myeloid leukaemia cells. Indeed, H-catalpol and H-aucubin down-regulated BCR-ABL phosphorylation and inhibited constitutive STAT3 activation through abrogating upstream JAK2 and c-Src and constitutive STAT5 activation leading to apoptosis through caspase-3 activation. Hydrolysed-catalpol enhanced the apoptosis induced by imatinib mesylate and this correlated with down-regulation of gene products that mediate cell proliferation (cyclin D1), and cell survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin); all known to be regulated by the STAT3. Overall, our results provide novel insight into the role of hydrolysed iridoids in potentially treating leukaemia through the modulation of STAT3 signalling pathway.","['Kim, Min-Beom', 'Kim, Chulwon', 'Chung, Won-Seok', 'Cho, Jae-Heung', 'Nam, Dongwoo', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon', 'Ahn, Kwang Seok']","['Kim MB', 'Kim C', 'Chung WS', 'Cho JH', 'Nam D', 'Kim SH', 'Ahn KS']","['College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegidong Dongdaemungu, Seoul, 130-701, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150113,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Iridoid Glucosides/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Iridoid Glycosides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/09/30 06:00,['2015/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ptr.5272 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2015 Mar;29(3):434-43. doi: 10.1002/ptr.5272.

Herein, a descriptor for this property was calculated using a simple adaptation of the type of polar carbon atoms included (WcAdap) to explore the possibility of its use in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies of ILs. The resulting model was tested using a database of ILs with toxicity against the Leukemia rat cell line IPC-81. Two other models were constructed using Crippen log P and Mannhold log P descriptors, which are both available in the free program PaDEL. The use of WcAdap led to a better and more indicative model.

Most studies on heme regulation have been done in erythroid cells or hepatocytes; however, much less is known about heme metabolism in other cell types. The feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor (FLVCR) is a 12-transmembrane domain surface protein that exports heme from cells, and it was shown to be required for erythroid development. In this article, we show that deletion of Flvcr in murine hematopoietic precursors caused a complete block in alphabeta T cell development at the CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive stage, although other lymphoid lineages were not affected. Moreover, FLVCR was required for the proliferation and survival of peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. These studies identify a novel and unexpected role for FLVCR, a major facilitator superfamily metabolite transporter, in T cell development and suggest that heme metabolism is particularly important in the T lineage.","['Philip, Mary', 'Funkhouser, Scott A', 'Chiu, Edison Y', 'Phelps, Susan R', 'Delrow, Jeffrey J', 'Cox, James', 'Fink, Pamela J', 'Abkowitz, Janis L']","['Philip M', 'Funkhouser SA', 'Chiu EY', 'Phelps SR', 'Delrow JJ', 'Cox J', 'Fink PJ', 'Abkowitz JL']","['Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195; Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109;', 'Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195;', 'Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195;', 'Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195;', 'Genomics Shared Resource, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109;', 'University of Utah Metabolomics Core Facility, Salt Lake City, UT 84132; and.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98109.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195; janabk@u.washington.edu.']",['eng'],"['P30 DK072437/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA158069/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704-39/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI64318/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL031823/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI064318/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150112,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Heme/*immunology', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Virus/*immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",PMC4323866,['NIHMS649695'],2015/01/15 06:00,2015/04/23 06:00,['2015/01/14 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1402172 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1402172 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 Feb 15;194(4):1677-85. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1402172.

However, CAR-modified T cells (CAR T cells) have mostly failed in patients with solid tumors or low-grade B-cell malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia with bulky lymph node involvement. Herein, we enhance the antitumor efficacy of CAR T cells through the constitutive expression of CD40 ligand (CD40L, CD154). T cells genetically modified to constitutively express CD40L (CD40L-modified T cells) demonstrated increased proliferation and secretion of proinflammatory TH1 cytokines. Further, CD40L-modified T cells augmented the immunogenicity of CD40(+) tumor cells by the upregulated surface expression of costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86), adhesion molecules (CD54, CD58, and CD70), human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules (Class I and HLA-DR), and the Fas-death receptor (CD95). Additionally, CD40L-modified T cells induced maturation and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 by monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Finally, tumor-targeted CD19-specific CAR/CD40L T cells exhibited increased cytotoxicity against CD40(+) tumors and extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice in a xenotransplant model of CD19(+) systemic lymphoma. This preclinical data supports the clinical application of CAR T cells additionally modified to constitutively express CD40L with anticipated enhanced antitumor efficacy.","['Curran, Kevin J', 'Seinstra, Beatrijs A', 'Nikhamin, Yan', 'Yeh, Raymond', 'Usachenko, Yelena', 'van Leeuwen, Dayenne G', 'Purdon, Terence', 'Pegram, Hollie J', 'Brentjens, Renier J']","['Curran KJ', 'Seinstra BA', 'Nikhamin Y', 'Yeh R', 'Usachenko Y', 'van Leeuwen DG', 'Purdon T', 'Pegram HJ', 'Brentjens RJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['K08 CA095152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA138738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA059350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA059350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA095152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150113,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,"['Animals', 'CD40 Ligand/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Immunotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",PMC4395796,,2015/01/15 06:00,2016/04/06 06:00,['2015/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)30096-X [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2015.4 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2015 Apr;23(4):769-78. doi: 10.1038/mt.2015.4.

Whether PRMT5 has overt oncogenic function in the context of leukemia/lymphoma and whether it represents a therapeutic target remains to be established. We demonstrate that inactivation of PRMT5 inhibits colony-forming activity by multiple oncogenic drivers, including cyclin D1, c-MYC, NOTCH1, and MLL-AF9. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PRMT5 overexpression specifically cooperates with cyclin D1 to drive lymphomagenesis in a mouse model, revealing inherent neoplastic activity. Molecular analysis of lymphomas revealed that arginine methylation of p53 selectively suppresses expression of crucial proapoptotic and antiproliferative target genes, thereby sustaining tumor cell self-renewal and proliferation and bypassing the need for the acquisition of inactivating p53 mutations. Critically, analysis of human tumor specimens reveals a strong correlation between cyclin D1 overexpression and p53 methylation, supporting the biomedical relevance of this pathway. SIGNIFICANCE: We have identified and functionally validated a crucial role for PRMT5 for the inhibition of p53-dependent tumor suppression in response to oncogenic insults. The requisite role for PRMT5 in the context of multiple lymphoma/leukemia oncogenic drivers suggests a molecular rationale for therapeutic development.","['Li, Yan', 'Chitnis, Nilesh', 'Nakagawa, Hiroshi', 'Kita, Yoshiaki', 'Natsugoe, Shoji', 'Yang, Yi', 'Li, Zihai', 'Wasik, Mariusz', 'Klein-Szanto, Andres J P', 'Rustgi, Anil K', 'Diehl, J Alan']","['Li Y', 'Chitnis N', 'Nakagawa H', 'Kita Y', 'Natsugoe S', 'Yang Y', 'Li Z', 'Wasik M', 'Klein-Szanto AJ', 'Rustgi AK', 'Diehl JA']","['Department of Cancer Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Departments of Medicine and Genetics and Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Digestive Surgery, and Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Kagoshima University School of Medicine, Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Digestive Surgery, and Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Kagoshima University School of Medicine, Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

METHOD: Data of 13 cases with AAP in childhood seen from March 2011 to March 2014 were analyzed with regard to clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, imaging feature and treatment. RESULT: AAP was found in 12 of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 1 of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 8 were boys and 5 were girls, with a mean age 6 years. In 12 cases AAP occurred during the induction-remission treatment, in 1 case during the maintenance- intensification phase. AAP occurred after a median of two doses, and 9 d (median) from the latest administration of PEG-asparaginase. The major manifestations of AAP was abdominal pain (11/13) . At the time of AAP diagnosis during the first 48 hours the median peak serum amylase and serum lipase levels were 559 U/L (range 118-1 585, upper normal limit: 125) and 934 U/L (range 221-1 673, upper normal limit: 300). Three cases with serum amylase and serum lipase levels above 3 times upper normal limit were repeatedly complicated with pancreatic pseudocyst; 11 patients had abnormal CT imaging, 8 cases revealed effusion around the pancreas, and 4 cases had pseudocyst. Therapy with ulinastatin, octreotide acetate, glucocorticoid could relieve abdominal pain significantly. Three cases underwent abdominal puncture drainage and 5 cases fulfilled nasojejunal nutrition therapy. Nine of them were cured, 4 developed pseudocyst, in 2 AAP vanished gradually and 2 died with pseudocyst.

METHOD: Taqman real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out to detect the relative expression of miR-34b in control group (bone marrow cells of 20 children without blood disease) and 8 leukemia cell lines (U937, HL-60, MV4-11, M2R, K562, Raji, CCRF, DAMI). Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was carried out to detect the methylation differences of miR-34b in control group (Bone marrow cells of 23 children without blood disease), 8 leukemia cell lines. HL-60 and K562 were treated with methyltransferase inhibitor (5-aza-2-dC) for further detection of its methylation status and expression of miR-34b. Hsa-miR-34b mimics was transfected into K562 cell by liposome, the transfection efficiency was detected by flow cytometry. The cell proliferation of hsa-miR-34b transfected group in each stage was measured with CCK-8 assay, and then compared with non-transfected group and negative control group. RESULT: The relative expression level of miR-34b in the group of children without blood disease and the group of leukemia cell lines were 5.22 +/- 1.15, 0.03 +/- 0.03. The results showed that, the group of leukemia cell lines was significantly different from the control group (t = 4.538, P < 0.01) . Eight leukemia cell lines showed methylation, the positive rate of the methyl was 100%. There was no methylation in the 23 cases of control group. After leukemia cell lines HL-60 and K562 were treated with 5-aza-2-dC, the methylated bands became obviously weakened, and the relative expression levels of miR-34b substantially increased 49.5 times and 18.8 times respectively. After hsa-miR-34b mimics was transfected into K562 cell by liposome, its transfection efficiency detected by flow cytometry was 61% and the cell proliferation was measured with CCK-8 assay from which it was found that the cell proliferation was significantly suppressed compared with the control group at 48 h (t = 9.303, P < 0.01), 72 h (t = 65.617, P < 0.01), 96 h (t = 36.878, P < 0.01) and 120 h (t = 18.748, P < 0.01) in hsa-miR-34b transfected group, with the inhibition rate of 12.2% (48 h), 45.7% (72 h), 32.5% (96 h) and 22.9% (120 h). CONCLUSION: The hypermethylation of promoter leads to decrease in the expression levels of miR-34b in leukemia cell lines, which attenuate mechanism of proliferative inhibition may be one of the reasons of occurrence or development of childhood leukemia.","['Cao, Lan', 'Wang, Na', 'Pan, Jian', 'Gu, Guixiong', 'Hu, Shaoyan', 'Zhao, Wenli', 'Chai, Yihuan']","['Cao L', 'Wang N', 'Pan J', 'Gu G', 'Hu S', 'Zhao W', 'Chai Y']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215003, China."", 'Email: cyh_1949@aliyun.com.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,IM,"['Azacitidine', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2015/01/14 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2014 Nov;52(11):840-5.,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BAFF, APRIL and TRAIL provide crucial survival signals to immature, naive and activated B cells. These ligands are capable of activating a broad spectrum of intracellular signalling cascades that can either induce apoptosis or protect from programmed cell death. BAFF and APRIL, which can directly activate the NF-kappaB pathway, have been identified as crucial survival factors for ALL cells. Here, we have analyzed serum BAFF, APRIL and TRAIL concentrations in 48 patients with newly diagnosed ALL and 44 healthy volunteers. The levels of APRIL and BAFF were significantly higher in ALL patients as compared to healthy volunteers. In contrast, concentrations of TRAIL were significantly lower in ALL patients. Moreover, following induction, the levels of APRIL, but not BAFF or TRAIL, were significantly lower in a group of patients with complete remission (CR) as compared to non-respondent (NR) ALL patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated statistically significant differences in concentrations of APRIL between CR MRD-negative and CR, MRD-positive ALL patients. Notably detection of higher concentrations of APRIL was associated with shorter leukaemia-free survival and overall survival. Altogether, our data indicate that APRIL can play an important role in the pathogenesis of ALL and the measurement of APRIL levels can improve prognostication in ALL patients.","['Bolkun, L', 'Lemancewicz, D', 'Jablonska, E', 'Szumowska, A', 'Bolkun-Skornicka, U', 'Moniuszko, M', 'Dzieciol, J', 'Kloczko, J']","['Bolkun L', 'Lemancewicz D', 'Jablonska E', 'Szumowska A', 'Bolkun-Skornicka U', 'Moniuszko M', 'Dzieciol J', 'Kloczko J']","['Department of Haematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Poland.

However, which ALDH1's isoenzymes are contributing to ALDH1 activity has not been determined. In addition, the prognostic value of individual ALDH1 isoenzyme is not clear. In the current study, we investigated the prognostic value of ALDH1 isoenzymes in BC patients through ""the Kaplan-Meier plotter"" (KM plotter) database, in which updated gene expression data and survival information are from a total of 3455 BC patients. ALDH1A1 messenger RNA (mRNA) high expression was found to be correlated to worsen overall survival (OS) for all BC patients. ALDH1A2 and ALDH1L1 mRNA high expressions were found to be correlated to better OS for all BC patients. Both of ALDH1A3 and ALDH1B1 mRNA high expressions were not found to be correlated to OS for all BC patients. These results strongly support that ALDH1A1 was only a biomarker for predicting poor survival of BC patients among ALDH1 isoenzymes. ALDH1A1 might be a major contributor of ALDH1 activity in BC, since only ALDH1A1 mRNA high expression was found to be significantly correlated to worsen OS for all BC patients.","['Wu, Shaokun', 'Xue, Weiping', 'Huang, Xiaobo', 'Yu, Xiaoli', 'Luo, Ming', 'Huang, Ying', 'Liu, Yimin', 'Bi, Zhuofei', 'Qiu, Xingsheng', 'Bai, Shoumin']","['Wu S', 'Xue W', 'Huang X', 'Yu X', 'Luo M', 'Huang Y', 'Liu Y', 'Bi Z', 'Qiu X', 'Bai S']","[""Department of Oncology, SunYat-Sen Memorial Hospital, SunYat-Sen University, Guangzhou, 510120, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150113,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family', 'Alternative Splicing/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Retinal Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,,2015/01/15 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2015/01/14 06:00'],"['2014/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-014-2852-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2015 Apr;36(4):2421-6. doi: 10.1007/s13277-014-2852-6.

CASE: A 6.5-year-old boy with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) came with excessive weight gain, headache, and irritability over last 2 months. CNS was not involved at diagnosis of ALL. On examination, the child had central obesity, moon facies, and buffalo hump. His height was at 3rd-25th percentile, weight was at >97th percentile, and blood pressure was >99th percentile. Serum cortisol was high in morning (25 mug/dL), at 12 a.m. (19.3 mug/dL) and remained elevated (7.5 mug/dL) after overnight dexamethasone test. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed blast cells suggestive of CNS relapse. Our second case was a 2.5-year-old girl with precursor B cell ALL, came with complaints of excessive weight gain, and increased appetite over last 3 months. On examination, the child had Cushingoid facies with trunkal obesity. Blood pressure was normal. Serum cortisol at 8 a.m. (40.4 mug/dL), midnight (13.8 mug/dL), and after dexamethasone suppression test (22 mug/dL) was high. CSF examination showed blast cells. We diagnosed both cases with adrenocorticotropic hormone-dependent CS due to CNS relapse based on the above findings. CONCLUSION: We have reported two cases of CS due to CNS relapse of ALL. CS is a very rare manifestation of CNS relapse in patients with leukemia, and the exact pathogenesis is not clear.","['Yadav, Jaivinder', 'Jain, Vandana']","['Yadav J', 'Jain V']",,['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,9508900,IM,"['Central Nervous System/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cushing Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/pathology']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/01/13 06:00'],"['2014/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/jpem-2014-0434 [doi]', '/j/jpem.ahead-of-print/jpem-2014-0434/jpem-2014-0434.xml [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2015 May;28(5-6):717-9. doi: 10.1515/jpem-2014-0434.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The detection of aberrant antigen expression by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) is considered a promising tool to improve MDS diagnostics. We prospectively analyzed 804 unselected patients sent with suspected MDS for correlation of MFC findings with overall survival (OS) in the context of cytomorphologic and cytogenetic findings. Patients with evidence of MDS by MFC had a significantly worse OS as compared to those without (OS at 2 years, 71.2% vs. 89.4%; P<0.001). The number of aberrantly expressed antigens as a continuous variable was significantly associated with OS [P<0.001, hazards ratio (HR): 1.19 per additional aberrantly expressed antigen]. Multivariate analysis proved a diagnosis of MDS by MFC to be independently associated with OS (P=0.050; HR: 1.42). Furthermore, a diagnosis of MDS by MFC was related to inferior survival within all three cytomorphologically defined subgroups, i.e., proven MDS (median OS, 45.4 vs. 52.8 months, P<0.001), suspected MDS (2-year-OS, 75.0% vs. 82.8%; P=0.062), and MDS excluded (2-year-OS, 63.5% vs. 92.8%, P=0.020). Our data clearly demonstrate that, in the assessment of cytopenic patients with suspected MDS, a diagnosis of MDS by MFC is independently associated with OS, which had been shown in previous studies for today's standard diagnostic parameters cytomorphology and cytogenetics. MFC may, therefore, be considered an additional tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected MDS.","['Kern, Wolfgang', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Alpermann, Tamara', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Kern W', 'Bacher U', 'Haferlach C', 'Alpermann T', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach T']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150324,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

As unknown ancestral differences could potentially have an impact on transplant outcome, we developed an average allele length discrepancy (AALD) score to assess allele length discrepancy between donor/recipient (D/R) using microsatellites analysed routinely in post-transplant chimeric assessment. This was then compared with outcome in a homogeneously treated cohort of pediatric patients undergoing high-resolution sibling or matched unrelated donor transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). AALD scores formed a numeric continuum ranging from 0 to 1.4 (median 0.76) for sibling pairs and 0.8-2.17 (median 1.6) for high-resolution matched unrelated donor (HR-MUD) pairs. There was a trend for worse OS with increasing AALD score, which reached statistical significance above a threshold of 1.7 for OS. Patients whose transplants had an AALD score of 1.8 had a risk of non-relapse mortality 4.9 times greater (P=0.025) and relapse risk three times greater (P=0.058) than those scoring <1.8.

Although many transplants are performed worldwide, the number of patients enrolled prospectively into clinical trials is small. Patient and physician preferences often override treatment assignments in randomized transplant trials, biasing the common intention-to-treat analyses. Large retrospective and observational database studies are likely to detect the real effect of allo-HCT. However, they may be subject to immortal time and other biases derived from heterogeneity of allo-HCT indications and approaches and differences in referral or institutional policies affecting patient selection. Timing of the transplant procedure may be fundamental but studies commencing at start of transplant may neglect the influence of pretransplant therapies. Conversely, a prolonged lag period between the decision and execution of transplant may artificially 'improve' the outcome by 'natural' selection weeding out patients relapsing or dying before transplant.

METHODS: Plasma concentrations of imatinib, bosentan and sildenafil were collected in a phase III study and were used to characterize the PK of imatinib in this population. DDIs among the three drugs were quantified using a linear mixed model and log-transformed drug concentrations. RESULTS: The population mean estimates of apparent clearance (CL/F) and volume (V/F) were 10.8 l h(-1) (95% CI 9.2, 12.4 l h(-1) ) and 267 l (95% CI 208, 326 l), respectively. It was estimated that sildenafil concentrations increased, on average, by 64% (95% CI 32%, 103%) and bosentan concentrations by 51% (95% CI 12%, 104%), in the presence of imatinib. Despite increased concentrations of co-medications, treatment differences between imatinib and placebo for change in 6 min walk distance and pulmonary vascular resistance were relatively constant across the entire concentration range for sildenafil and bosentan. Overall, higher concentrations of imatinib and bosentan were not associated with increasing liver enzymes (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminases [SGOT]/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]). CONCLUSIONS: Population PKs of imatinib in patients with severe PAH were found comparable with those of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Imatinib was found effective regardless of the co-medications and showed intrinsic efficacy beyond merely elevating the concentrations of the co-medications due to DDIs. There was no evidence of increased risk of liver toxicity upon co-administration with bosentan.","['Renard, Didier', 'Bouillon, Thomas', 'Zhou, Ping', 'Flesch, Gerard', 'Quinn, Debbie']","['Renard D', 'Bouillon T', 'Zhou P', 'Flesch G', 'Quinn D']","['Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Horsham Research Centre, Horsham, West Sussex, UK.', 'Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150601,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,IM,"['Adult', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Bosentan', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary/blood/*drug therapy', 'Imatinib Mesylate/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Sildenafil Citrate/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Sulfonamides/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Vascular Resistance/drug effects', 'Young Adult']",PMC4500327,,2015/01/13 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2015/01/13 06:00'],"['2014/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/11 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bcp.12584 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2015 Jul;80(1):75-85. doi: 10.1111/bcp.12584.

We used the Mayo Clinic CLL and Lymphoma Databases to identify CLL patients who developed biopsy-proven HL (CLL/HL) on follow-up, as well as cases of de novo HL (i.e., without prior CLL). Among 3887 CLL patients seen at Mayo Clinic from January 1995 through August 2011, 26 (0.7%) developed HL. In a nested cohort of 2,465 newly diagnosed CLL patients followed prospectively, the incidence of HL was 0.05%/year (10 year risk = 0.5%). The median overall survival (OS) from date of HL diagnosis in patients with CLL/HL was 3.9 years compared to not reached for de novo HL patients (n = 709) seen during the same time interval (P < 0.001). The shorter OS of CLL/HL patients persisted after adjusting for differences in age and Ann Arbor stage of disease. The International Prognostic score (IPS) developed for de novo HL stratified prognosis among CLL/HL patients with median survival of not reached, 6.2, 2.4, and 0.3 years (P = 0.006) for those with IPS scores of </=2, 3, 4, and >/=5, respectively. In summary, approximately 1 of every 200 CLL patients will develop HL within 10 years. Survival after HL diagnosis in patients with CLL is shorter than de novo HL patients.

Clinical trial data may not reflect the full AE profile of BCR-ABL inhibitors because of stringent study entry criteria, relatively small sample size, and limited duration of follow-up. To determine the utility of the FDA AE Reporting System (FAERS) surveillance database for identifying AEs possibly associated with the BCR-ABL inhibitors imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib in the postmarketing patient population, we conducted Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker disproportionality analyses of FAERS reports on AEs in relevant system organ classes. Signals consistent with the known safety profiles of these agents as well as signals for less well-described AEs were detected. Bone marrow necrosis, conjunctival hemorrhage, and peritoneal fluid retention events were uniquely associated with imatinib. AEs that most commonly reached the threshold for dasatinib consisted of terms relating to hemorrhage and fluid retention, including pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. Most terms that reached the threshold solely with nilotinib were related to peripheral and cardiac vascular events. Although this type of analysis cannot determine AE incidence or establish causality, these findings elucidate the AEs reported in patients treated with BCR-ABL inhibitors across multiple clinical trials and in the community setting for all approved and nonapproved indications, suggesting drug-AE associations warrant further investigation.

Similar to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), early studies suggested a pro-tumorigenic role of NOTCH in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), mainly based on the increased expression levels of the genes within the pathway. Recently, data from exome sequencing analyses unexpectedly pointed to a tumour suppressor role for NOTCH in HNSCC by identifying loss-of-function mutations in the NOTCH1 gene in a significant proportion of patients. These data have questioned the accepted role of NOTCH in HNSCC and the possible rationale of targeting NOTCH in this disease. This review summarises the current information on NOTCH signalling in HNSCC and discusses how this pathway can apparently exert opposing effects within the same disease.","['Yap, L F', 'Lee, D', 'Khairuddin, Anm', 'Pairan, M F', 'Puspita, B', 'Siar, C H', 'Paterson, I C']","['Yap LF', 'Lee D', 'Khairuddin A', 'Pairan MF', 'Puspita B', 'Siar CH', 'Paterson IC']","['Department of Oral Biology & Biomedical Sciences and Oral Cancer Research & Coordinating Centre, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Oral Biology & Biomedical Sciences and Oral Cancer Research & Coordinating Centre, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Oral Biology & Biomedical Sciences and Oral Cancer Research & Coordinating Centre, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Oral Biology & Biomedical Sciences and Oral Cancer Research & Coordinating Centre, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Oral Biology & Biomedical Sciences and Oral Cancer Research & Coordinating Centre, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Oro-Maxillofacial Surgical & Medical Sciences, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Oral Biology & Biomedical Sciences and Oral Cancer Research & Coordinating Centre, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150129,Denmark,Oral Dis,Oral diseases,9508565,,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Notch/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/genetics']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2016/12/20 06:00,['2015/01/13 06:00'],"['2014/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/odi.12309 [doi]'],ppublish,Oral Dis. 2015 Oct;21(7):850-7. doi: 10.1111/odi.12309.

We investigated the in vitro effects of rigosertib on an MDS-derived cell line MDS-L and a myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60. Rigosertib suppressed the proliferation of both HL-60 and MDS-L cells and induced apoptosis by inhibition of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway. As the effects on cell cycle, rigosertib treatment promoted the phosphorylation of histone H2AX and led to the DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest. In addition, an immunofluorescence staining study demonstrated the abnormal localization of aurora A kinase, suggesting that rigosertib causes perturbation of spindle assembly and deregulated mitotic patterns towards cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We also found that rigosertib exerted growth inhibitory effects on two lymphoid cell lines, Jurkat and Ramos. We further examined the molecular pathways influenced by rigosertib from the gene expression profiling data of MDS-L cells and found a possible involvement of rigosertib treatment in the upregulation of the genes related to microtubule kinetics and the downregulation of the mRNA degradation system. The gene set enrichment analysis showed the suppression of ""nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)"" as the most significantly affected gene set. These data provide a new aspect and a potential utility of rigosertib for the treatment of refractory hematopoietic malignancies.","['Hyoda, Tomoko', 'Tsujioka, Takayuki', 'Nakahara, Takako', 'Suemori, Shin-ichiro', 'Okamoto, Shuichiro', 'Kataoka, Mikio', 'Tohyama, Kaoru']","['Hyoda T', 'Tsujioka T', 'Nakahara T', 'Suemori S', 'Okamoto S', 'Kataoka M', 'Tohyama K']","['Division of Medical Technology, Kawasaki College of Allied Health Professions, Okayama, Japan; Department of Medical Technology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150220,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Aurora Kinase A/pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glycine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Spindle Apparatus/genetics', 'Sulfones/*pharmacology']",PMC4376437,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/06/16 06:00,['2015/01/13 06:00'],"['2014/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12605 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2015 Mar;106(3):287-93. doi: 10.1111/cas.12605.

Region II in northern Chile experienced very high concentrations of inorganic arsenic in drinking water, especially in the main city Antofagasta from 1958 until an arsenic removal plant was installed in 1970. METHODS: We investigated breast cancer mortality from 1950 to 2010 among women in Region II compared to Region V, which had low arsenic water concentrations. We conducted studies on human breast cancer cell lines and compared arsenic exposure in Antofagasta with concentrations inducing apoptosis in laboratory studies. FINDINGS: Before 1958, breast cancer mortality rates were similar, but in 1958-1970 the rates in Region II were half those in Region V (rate ratio RR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.40-0.66; p<0.0001). Women under the age of 60 experienced a 70% reduction in breast cancer mortality during 1965-1970 (RR=0.30, 0.17-0.54; p<0.0001). Breast cancer cell culture studies showed apoptosis at arsenic concentrations close to those estimated to have occurred in people in Region II. INTERPRETATION: We found biologically plausible major reductions in breast cancer mortality during high exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water which could not be attributed to bias or confounding. We recommend clinical trial assessment of inorganic arsenic in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.","['Smith, Allan H', 'Marshall, Guillermo', 'Yuan, Yan', 'Steinmaus, Craig', 'Liaw, Jane', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Wood, Lily', 'Heirich, Marissa', 'Fritzemeier, Rebecca M', 'Pegram, Mark D', 'Ferreccio, Catterina']","['Smith AH', 'Marshall G', 'Yuan Y', 'Steinmaus C', 'Liaw J', 'Smith MT', 'Wood L', 'Heirich M', 'Fritzemeier RM', 'Pegram MD', 'Ferreccio C']","['Arsenic Research Group, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA (Prof AH Smith MD, Y Yuan MPH, Assoc Prof C Steinmaus MD, J Liaw MPH);

Exposure of B-cells to an anti-CD20 Fab'-morpholino oligonucleotide1 (MORF1) conjugate decorated the cell surface with MORF1; further exposure of the decorated cells to multivalent polymer-oligonucleotide2 conjugates (P-MORF2) resulted in CD20 clustering at the cell surface with induction of apoptosis. We evaluated this concept in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells isolated from 10 patients. Apoptosis and cytotoxicity were observed in eight samples, including 2 samples with the 17p13 deletion, which suggested a p53-independent mechanism of apoptosis induction. When compared to an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb), the nanotherapeutic showed significantly more potent apoptosis-inducing activity and cytotoxicity. This was due to the multivalency effect (8 binding sites per polymer chain) of our design in comparison to the divalent mAb.

We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIR) to compare VACS and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results rates. RESULTS: Compared to chart review, both Veterans Affairs Central Cancer Registry (VACCR) and ICD-9 diagnoses had approximately 90% sensitivity; however, VACCR had higher positive predictive value (96% versus 63%). There were 6,010 VACCR and 13,386 ICD-9 incident cancers among 116,072 veterans. Although ICD-9 rates tended to be double VACCR rates, most IRRs were in the same direction and of similar magnitude, regardless of data source. Using either source, all cancers combined, most viral-infection-related cancers, lung cancer, melanoma, and leukemia had significantly elevated IRRs. Using ICD-9, eight additional IRRs were significantly elevated, most likely due to false positive diagnoses. Most ICD-9 SIRs were significantly elevated and all were higher than the corresponding VACCR SIR. CONCLUSIONS: ICD-9 may be used with caution for estimating IRRs, but should be avoided when estimating incidence or SIRs. Elevated cancer risk based on VACCR diagnoses among HIV-infected veterans was consistent with other studies.","['Park, Lesley S', 'Tate, Janet P', 'Rodriguez-Barradas, Maria C', 'Rimland, David', 'Goetz, Matthew Bidwell', 'Gibert, Cynthia', 'Brown, Sheldon T', 'Kelley, Michael J', 'Justice, Amy C', 'Dubrow, Robert']","['Park LS', 'Tate JP', 'Rodriguez-Barradas MC', 'Rimland D', 'Goetz MB', 'Gibert C', 'Brown ST', 'Kelley MJ', 'Justice AC', 'Dubrow R']","['Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT, USA ; Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA ; Department of General Internal Medicine, Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, West Haven, CT, USA.', 'Infectious Diseases Section, Michael E.

In the last years, many studies have been performed on the anticancer effects of flavonoids. Echinophora platyloba DC plant (Khousharizeh) is one of the indigenous medicinal plants which is used as a food seasoning and medicine in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extract was evaluated in terms of antimutagenicity properties by a standard reverse mutation assay (Ames Test). This was performed with histidine auxotroph strain of Salmonella typhimurium (TA100). Thus, it requires histidine from a foreign supply to ensure its growth. The afore mentioned strain gives rise to reverted colonies when expose to carcinogen substance (Sodium Azide). The other objective of this study was to examine the in vitro cytotoxic activity of cell death of crude methanolic extracts prepared from Echinophora platyloba on Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia cell line (NB4). Cytotoxicity and viability of methanolic extract was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and dye exclusion assay. RESULTS: In Ames test the extract prevented the reverted mutations and the hindrance percent was 93.4% in antimutagenicity test. Data obtained from this assay indicated that the extract significantly reduced the viability of NB4 cells and inhibited cell growth in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the antimutagenicity effect of Echinophora Platyloba and suggests that it has a potential as an anticancer agent.","['Entezari, Maliheh', 'Dabaghian, Fataneh Hashem', 'Hashemi, Mehrdad']","['Entezari M', 'Dabaghian FH', 'Hashemi M']","['Department of Genetics, Islamic Azad University, Tehran Medical Branch, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,India,J Cancer Res Ther,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,101249598,IM,"['Antimutagenic Agents/*chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry', 'Apiaceae/*chemistry', 'Carcinogens/chemistry', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Histidine/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Methanol', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens', 'Plant Extracts/*chemistry', 'Salmonella', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/13 06:00'],"['2015/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['JCanResTher_2014_10_4_1004_137907 [pii]', '10.4103/0973-1482.137907 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Ther. 2014 Oct-Dec;10(4):1004-7. doi: 10.4103/0973-1482.137907.,"['0 (Antimutagenic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', 'Y4S76JWI15 (Methanol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We here report on the construction and selection of bispecific FLT3 X CD3 antibodies in a new recombinant format, termed Fabsc, that resembles the normal antibody structure more closely than the well-established bispecific single chain (bssc)-format. Our preferred antibody, which emerged from an initial selection procedure utilizing different FLT3- and CD3-antibodies, contains the FLT3-antibody 4G8 and the CD3-antibody UCHT1. The 4G8 X UCHT1 Fabsc-antibody was found to be superior to a bssc-antibody with identical specificities with respect to (i) affinity to the target antigen FLT3, (ii) production yield by transfected cells, and (iii) the diminished formation of aggregates. T-cell activation in the presence and absence of cultured leukemic cells and killing of these cells was comparable for both molecules. In addition, the 4G8 X UCHT1 Fabsc-antibody was found to induce T-cell activation and efficient killing of leukemic blasts in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. In these experiments, the bispecific molecule was clearly superior to an Fc-optimized monospecific FLT3-antibody described previously, indicating that within PBMC of AML patients the recruitment of T cells is more effective than that of natural killer cells.","['Durben, Michael', 'Schmiedel, Dominik', 'Hofmann, Martin', 'Vogt, Fabian', 'Nubling, Tina', 'Pyz, Elwira', 'Buhring, Hans-Jorg', 'Rammensee, Hans-Georg', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Grosse-Hovest, Ludger', 'Jung, Gundram']","['Durben M', 'Schmiedel D', 'Hofmann M', 'Vogt F', 'Nubling T', 'Pyz E', 'Buhring HJ', 'Rammensee HG', 'Salih HR', 'Grosse-Hovest L', 'Jung G']","['1] Department of Immunology, Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany [2] Present address: Synimmune GmbH, Auf der Morgenstelle 15, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', '1] Department of Immunology, Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany [2] Present address: Synimmune GmbH, Auf der Morgenstelle 15, Tubingen, Germany.', '1] Department of Immunology, Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany [2] German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 2, Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 2, Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', '1] Department of Immunology, Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany [2] German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', '1] Department of Internal Medicine 2, Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany [2] Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', '1] Department of Immunology, Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany [2] Present address: Synimmune GmbH, Auf der Morgenstelle 15, Tubingen, Germany.', '1] Department of Immunology, Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany [2] German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150112,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/*therapeutic use', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*immunology']",PMC4395786,,2015/01/13 06:00,2016/04/06 06:00,['2015/01/13 06:00'],"['2014/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)30084-3 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2015.2 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2015 Apr;23(4):648-55. doi: 10.1038/mt.2015.2.

The aim of this study is to investigate the occurrence of apoptosis and autophagy after treated by protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)-mediated SDT (PpIX-SDT) on human leukemia K562 cells as well as the relationship between them. Firstly, mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis was observed through morphological observation and biochemical analysis. Meanwhile, SDT was shown to induce autophagy in K562 cells, which caused an increase in EGFP-LC3 puncta cells, a conversion of LC3 II/I, formation of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs) and co-localization between LC3 and LAMP2 (a lysosome marker). Besides, pretreatment with autophagy inhibitor 3-MA or bafilomycin A1 was shown to provide protection against autophagy and to enhance SDT-induced apoptosis and necrosis, while the apoptosis suppressor z-VAD-fmk failed to affect formation of autophagic vacuoles or partially prevented SDT-induced cytotoxicity, which suggested that SDT-induced autophagy functioned as a survival mechanism. Additionally, this study reported apparent apoptosis and autophagy with dependence on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Preliminary data showed that ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) effectively blocked the SDT induced accumulation of ROS, reversed sono-damage, cell apoptosis and autophagy. Taken together, these data indicate that autophagy may be cytoprotective in our experimental system, and the ROS caused by PpIX-SDT treatment may play an important role in initiating apoptosis and autophagy.","['Su, Xiaomin', 'Wang, Pan', 'Yang, Shuang', 'Zhang, Kun', 'Liu, Quanhong', 'Wang, Xiaobing']","['Su X', 'Wang P', 'Yang S', 'Zhang K', 'Liu Q', 'Wang X']","[""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", ""Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ministry of Education, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Developing of Endangered Chinese Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.

BIN1 attenuation has been reported in several solid tumors; however, the role of BIN1 in lymphomagenesis remains unexplored. We recently demonstrated that BIN1 transcript levels are significantly downregulated in CD4(+)CD7(-) Sezary cells from patients with Sezary syndrome (SS), a subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). We have now demonstrated that restored BIN1 expression in CTCL cells leads to a significant reduction in cell proliferation, an increase in spontaneous and Fas/Fas ligand (Fas/FasL)-induced apoptosis in vitro and inhibition of tumorigenic activity of CTCL cells in vivo. Interestingly, restoration of BIN1 expression in CTCL cells downregulates the expression of c-FLIP, an important inhibitor of Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis, and activates the caspase cascade; these phenotypes can be rescued by knockdown of BIN1. Importantly, significantly reduced BIN1 expression and increased c-FLIP expression are observed in primary CTCL patient samples, and high BIN1 and low c-FLIP mRNA levels correlate with better survival rate in SS patients. These results indicate that BIN1 regulates Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis through c-FLIP and that BIN1 deficiency may have an important role in CTCL pathogenesis by causing apoptosis resistance. Thus BIN1 and c-FLIP represent potential therapeutic targets in CTCL.","['Esmailzadeh, S', 'Huang, Y', 'Su, M-W', 'Zhou, Y', 'Jiang, X']","['Esmailzadeh S', 'Huang Y', 'Su MW', 'Zhou Y', 'Jiang X']","['1] Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada [2] Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', '1] Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada [2] Molecular Medicine Laboratory, Department of Dermatology and Skin Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada [3] Chieng Genomics Center, Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', '1] Molecular Medicine Laboratory, Department of Dermatology and Skin Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada [2] Chieng Genomics Center, Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', '1] Molecular Medicine Laboratory, Department of Dermatology and Skin Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada [2] Chieng Genomics Center, Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', '1] Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada [2] Department of Medical Genetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150112,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fas Ligand Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/01/13 06:00'],"['2014/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20159 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jun;29(6):1402-13. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.9.

Plerixafor, a specific antagonist of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, can rescue some but not all patients who failed to mobilize with G-CSF alone.

To discover alternative targetable pathways to enhance HSC mobilization, we studied the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and the effect of HIF-1alpha pharmacological stabilization on HSC mobilization in mice. We demonstrate in mice with HSC-specific conditional deletion of the Hif1a gene that the oxygen-labile transcription factor HIF-1alpha is essential for HSC mobilization in response to G-CSF and Plerixafor. Conversely, pharmacological stabilization of HIF-1alpha with the 4-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor FG-4497 synergizes with G-CSF and Plerixafor increasing mobilization of reconstituting HSCs 20-fold compared with G-CSF plus Plerixafor, currently the most potent mobilizing combination used in the clinic.","['Forristal, C E', 'Nowlan, B', 'Jacobsen, R N', 'Barbier, V', 'Walkinshaw, G', 'Walkley, C R', 'Winkler, I G', 'Levesque, J P']","['Forristal CE', 'Nowlan B', 'Jacobsen RN', 'Barbier V', 'Walkinshaw G', 'Walkley CR', 'Winkler IG', 'Levesque JP']","['Blood and Bone Diseases Program, Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'Blood and Bone Diseases Program, Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', '1] Blood and Bone Diseases Program, Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia [2] School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Blood and Bone Diseases Program, Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', 'Fibrogen Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA.', ""Stem Cell Regulation Unit, St Vincent's Institute and University of Melbourne, St Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia."", 'Blood and Bone Diseases Program, Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.', '1] Blood and Bone Diseases Program, Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia [2] School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150112,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzylamines', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclams', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Prolyl Hydroxylases/*physiology', 'Prolyl-Hydroxylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",PMC4498452,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/01/13 06:00'],"['2014/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/28 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20158 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Jun;29(6):1366-78. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.8.

Axl, a member of the Tyro3, Axl, Mer (TAM) receptor family, mediates proliferation and survival of AML cells and is upregulated upon cytostatic treatment. In addition, AML cells induce expression of the Axl ligand growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) in bone marrow stroma cells, which further amplifies their growth and therapy resistance. Interruption of Axl signaling by pharmacological approaches, including the small molecule Axl inhibitor BGB324, decreased disease burden and prolonged survival of AML mice. The Gas6-Axl pathway has translational relevance because Axl is expressed by approximately 50% of AML patients and Axl-targeting approaches can block growth of primary human AML cells. Thus, Axl represents a potential novel target in AML and BGB324 is now in clinical development.","['Janning, Melanie', 'Ben-Batalla, Isabel', 'Loges, Sonja']","['Janning M', 'Ben-Batalla I', 'Loges S']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, BMT with Section of Pneumology, Hubertus Wald Tumorzentrum, University Comprehensive Cancer Center Hamburg, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Editorial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150112,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/11/13 06:00,['2015/01/13 06:00'],"['2015/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1586/17474086.2015.997704 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2015 Apr;8(2):135-8. doi: 10.1586/17474086.2015.997704.

The main aim of this study was to analyze the nature of gene mutations in a cohort of Indian patients with FHL2 and to utilize this knowledge for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. METHODS: 13 HLH patients with abnormal perforin expression on NK cells by flow cytometry were included in the study. The entire coding region and intronic splice sites of the PRF1 gene were sequenced from the genomic DNA of these patients. RESULTS: 10 patients from the present series had an early presentation with severe clinical manifestations, while 3 had a delayed onset with unusual presenting features viz Hodgkin's lymphoma, tuberculosis and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Sequence analysis revealed 11 different mutations (8 novel and 3 previously reported) spread over the entire coding region of PRF1 gene. Missense mutation Trp129Ser in heterozygous state was present in all the 3 patients with a delayed onset of the disease. CONCLUSION: A wide heterogeneity was observed in the nature of mutations in Indian FHL2 patients. Molecular characterization of PRF1 gene was not only used in the confirmation of diagnosis but also in genetic counseling and pre-natal diagnosis in affected families.","['Mhatre, Snehal', 'Madkaikar, Manisha', 'Desai, Mukesh', 'Ghosh, Kanjaksha']","['Mhatre S', 'Madkaikar M', 'Desai M', 'Ghosh K']","['National Institute of Immunohaematology, 13th floor KEM Hospital, Parel, Mumbai 400012, India.', 'National Institute of Immunohaematology, 13th floor KEM Hospital, Parel, Mumbai 400012, India.

QSAR studies indicated electrophilicity of these compounds towards cellular nucleophiles may have a key role to play in their cytostatic activity. Representative compounds were also tested for topoisomerase IIalpha inhibitory potential, which indicated strong catalytic inhibition of the enzyme in vitro. The data showed that the fatty acid conjugates also possessed robust antioxidant activity in multiple analyses. This study also indicated that these compounds prompted significantly lower cellular damage in human fibroblasts than a currently used cancer drug sorafenib in vitro.

Little is known, however, about mechanisms of thrombogenesis in patients with PV. This report provides an overview of thrombogenesis pathophysiology in patients with PV and elucidates the roles of conventional and nonconventional thrombotic risk factors. In addition to several conventional risk factors for thrombosis, clinical data have implicated increased hematocrit and red blood cell adhesiveness, activated platelets, leukocytosis, and elevated JAK2(V617F) allele burden in patients with PV. Furthermore, PV-related inflammation may exacerbate thrombogenesis through varied mechanisms, including endothelial damage, inhibition of natural anticoagulant pathways, and secretion of procoagulant factors. These findings suggest a direct link between myeloproliferation and thrombogenesis in PV, which is likely to provide new opportunities for targeted antithrombotic interventions aimed at decreasing PV-related morbidity and mortality.","['Kroll, Michael H', 'Michaelis, Laura C', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Kroll MH', 'Michaelis LC', 'Verstovsek S']","['Section of Benign Hematology, Division of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 1464, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

Analysis of 30 years' epidemiologic data].",98-104,10.1556/OH.2015.30047 [doi],"INTRODUCTION: In their previous work, the authors reported 27-year' findings on the epidemiology of extranodal lymphomas in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county, Hungary. There are no other studies on this topic available in Hungary. AIM: The aim of this study was to analyse in detail the epidemiologic data of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who were recorded in the leukaemia/lymphoma registry of Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county during a 30-year period, to compare the main epidemiologic features of the extranodal and nodal forms, and compare the results with data reported in the international literature. METHOD: Between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 2012, 1123 adult patients with newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were recorded in the leukaemia/lymphoma registry of Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county. Of those, 347 patients suffered from extranodal, and 776 patients from nodal form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The authors compared the incidence of the extranodal and nodal forms, the age and sex distribution of patients, the ratio of B- and T-cell, as well as the indolent and aggressive forms, the geographic distribution and the association with carcinomas. In addition, they studied the occurrence of familial appearance and the localisation of extranodal forms. RESULTS: The occurrence of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas indicated an increasing tendency in their county. This tendency was true for both the extranodal and nodal forms, but it was more remarkable in the extranodal form of lymphomas. They found no substantial difference between the main epidemiologic features of the two forms. The gastrointestinal tract was the most frequent site of presentation for extranodal lymphomas. CONCLUSIONS: These observations are in line with data reported in the international literature. The data are essentially similar to those published in populations from Western European countries and the United States.","['Jako, Janos', 'Szerafin, Laszlo']","['Jako J', 'Szerafin L']","['Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg Megyei Josa Andras Oktatokorhaz Hematologiai Osztaly Nyiregyhaza.', 'Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg Megyei Josa Andras Oktatokorhaz Hematologiai Osztaly Nyiregyhaza.']",['hun'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Hungary,Orv Hetil,Orvosi hetilap,0376412,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hungary/epidemiology', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Sex Distribution', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/04/04 06:00,['2015/01/12 06:00'],"['2015/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['L071460607H36576 [pii]', '10.1556/OH.2015.30047 [doi]']",ppublish,Orv Hetil. 2015 Jan 18;156(3):98-104. doi: 10.1556/OH.2015.30047.,,['NOTNLM'],"['a noi es a ferfi genitalis traktus lymphomai', 'breast lymphoma', 'borlymphoma', 'central nervous system lymphoma', 'cutaneous lymphoma', 'emlolymphoma', 'epidemiology', 'epidemiologia', 'gastrointestinal lymphoma', 'gastrointestinalis lymphoma', 'kozponti idegrendszeri lymphoma', 'lymphoma of soft tissues', 'lymphoma of the thyroid gland', 'lymphomas of the female and male genital tract', 'lagyresz-lymphoma', 'nodal and extranodal lymphomas', 'nodalis es extranodalis lymphomak', 'non-Hodgkin-lymphoma', ""non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"", 'pajzsmirigylymphoma', 'tonsillalymphoma', 'tonsillar lymphoma']",,,,,,,,Extranodalis lymphomak Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg megye felnott lakossaga koreben. 30 ev adatainak elemzese.,,,,,

This study included 60 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia that were in remission for at least 2 years and 30 healthy controls. Systolic and diastolic function of myocardium was evaluated using conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging of the left ventricle, interventricular septum and right ventricle. Median age of patients was 11.7 years (range 10-14.9 years), and the median duration of remission was 4 years (range 2.5-5 years). All patients were treated with a low cumulative dose of adriamycin (100 mg/m(2)) according to the St. Jude Total-XIIIA protocol. The ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening were normal in the patient and control groups, even though EF values were significantly lower in the patients (69.5 +/- 2.3 vs. 72.7 +/- 3 %, P < 0.01). Myocardial systole (S m), early diastole (E m) and late diastole (A m) velocities in all segments of the myocardium were significantly lower in the patient group (P < 0.01 for all segments). Cardiotoxicity was noted in all segments of the myocardium in the patient group, despite the fact that they were all treated with a low cumulative dose of adriamycin. Based on these findings, we think that there is no safe dose for anthracyclines and periodic echocardiographic evaluation of both the left and right ventricles must be performed in all patients treated with anthracyclines, even at low doses.","['Bayram, Cengiz', 'Cetin, Ilker', 'Tavil, Betul', 'Yarali, Nese', 'Ekici, Filiz', 'Isik, Pamir', 'Tunc, Bahattin']","['Bayram C', 'Cetin I', 'Tavil B', 'Yarali N', 'Ekici F', 'Isik P', 'Tunc B']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Ankara Children's Hematology and Oncology Hospital, Ankara, Turkey, cengizbayram2013@gmail.com.""]",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20150111,United States,Pediatr Cardiol,Pediatric cardiology,8003849,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Cardiotoxicity/*diagnostic imaging/*etiology', 'Child', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Echocardiography, Doppler', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2015/01/12 06:00'],"['2014/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00246-015-1096-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Cardiol. 2015 Apr;36(4):862-6. doi: 10.1007/s00246-015-1096-6.

However, emerging data indicate that mTOR inhibitors are most effective when combined with other target agents. One strategy is to combine with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, since B-ALL is often characterized by epigenetic changes that silence the expression of pro-apoptotic factors. Here we tested combinations of mTOR and pan-HDAC inhibitors on B-ALL cells, including both Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) and non-Ph cell lines. We found that mTOR kinase inhibitors (TOR-KIs) synergize with HDAC inhibitors to cause apoptosis in B-ALL cells and the effect is greater when compared to rapamycin plus HDAC inhibitors. The combination of TOR-KIs with the clinically approved HDAC inhibitor vorinostat increased apoptosis in primary pediatric B-ALL cells in vitro. Mechanistically, TOR-KI and HDAC inhibitor combinations increased expression of pro-death genes, including targets of the Forkhead Box O (FOXO) transcription factors, and increased sensitivity to apoptotic triggers at the mitochondria. These findings suggest that targeting epigenetic factors can unmask the cytotoxic potential of TOR-KIs towards B-ALL cells.","['Beagle, Brandon R', 'Nguyen, Duc M', 'Mallya, Sharmila', 'Tang, Sarah S', 'Lu, Mengrou', 'Zeng, Zhihong', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Vo, Thanh-Trang', 'Fruman, David A']","['Beagle BR', 'Nguyen DM', 'Mallya S', 'Tang SS', 'Lu M', 'Zeng Z', 'Konopleva M', 'Vo TT', 'Fruman DA']","['Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA.']",['eng'],"['P30-CA062203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32-CA189629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50-CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA158383/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA189629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA9054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA062203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA158383/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC4385838,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/11 06:00'],"['2014/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2992 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2992 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Feb 10;6(4):2088-100. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2992.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been known that silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) display anti-leukemic activity via ROS overproduction. Hence, we hypothesized that AgNPs could improve therapeutic efficacy of ROS-generating agents against leukemia cells. In the current study, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR), a synthetic retinoid, was used as a drug model of ROS induction to investigate its synergistic effect with AgNPs. The data exhibited that AgNPs with uniform size prepared by an electrochemical method could localize in the lysosomes, mitochondria and cytoplasm of SHI-1 cells. More importantly, AgNPs together with 4-HPR could exhibit more cytotoxicity and apoptosis via overproduction of ROS in comparison with that alone. Taken together, these results reveal that AgNPs combined with ROS-generating drugs could potentially enhance therapeutic efficacy against leukemia cells, thereby providing a novel strategy for AgNPs in leukemia therapy.","['Guo, Dawei', 'Zhang, Junren', 'Huang, Zhihai', 'Jiang, Shanxiang', 'Gu, Ning']","['Guo D', 'Zhang J', 'Huang Z', 'Jiang S', 'Gu N']","['Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University, 1 Weigang, Nanjing 210095, PR China.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University, 1 Weigang, Nanjing 210095, PR China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Biomaterials and Devices, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, 2 Sipailou, Nanjing 210096, PR China.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Nanjing Agricultural University, 1 Weigang, Nanjing 210095, PR China.

Most current ex vivo expansion methods use co-culture with feeder cells (FC), but their use poses challenges for wide clinical application. We developed a particle-based NK cell expansion technology that uses plasma membrane particles (PM-particles) derived from K562-mbIL15-41BBL FCs. These PM-particles induce selective expansion of NK cells from unsorted PBMCs, with NK cells increasing 250-fold (median, 35; 10 donors; range, 94 to 1492) after 14 days of culture and up to 1265-fold (n = 14; range, 280 to 4426) typically after 17 days. The rate and efficiency of NK cell expansions with PM-particles and live FCs are comparable and far better than stimulation with soluble 41BBL, IL-15, and IL-2. Furthermore, NK cells expand selectively with PM-particles to 86% (median, 35; range, 71% to 99%) of total cells after 14 days. The extent of NK cell expansion and cell content was PM-particle concentration dependent. These NK cells were highly cytotoxic against several leukemic cell lines and also against patient acute myelogenous leukemia blasts. Phenotype analysis of these PM-particle-expanded NK cells was consistent with an activated cytotoxic phenotype. This novel NK cell expansion methodology has promising clinical therapeutic implications.","['Oyer, Jeremiah L', 'Igarashi, Robert Y', 'Kulikowski, Alexander R', 'Colosimo, Dominic A', 'Solh, Melhem M', 'Zakari, Ahmed', 'Khaled, Yasser A', 'Altomare, Deborah A', 'Copik, Alicja J']","['Oyer JL', 'Igarashi RY', 'Kulikowski AR', 'Colosimo DA', 'Solh MM', 'Zakari A', 'Khaled YA', 'Altomare DA', 'Copik AJ']","['Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida, College of Medicine, Orlando, Florida.', 'Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida, College of Medicine, Orlando, Florida.', 'Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida, College of Medicine, Orlando, Florida.', 'Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida, College of Medicine, Orlando, Florida.', 'Florida Hospital Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida; University of Central Florida, College of Medicine, Orlando, Florida.', 'Florida Hospital Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida.', 'Florida Hospital Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida.', 'Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida, College of Medicine, Orlando, Florida.', 'Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Central Florida, College of Medicine, Orlando, Florida.

This analysis, using peptide/MHC tetramers, is often ambiguous. From a leukemia cell line, we identified a CDK4-derived peptide epitope, UNC-CDK4-1 (ALTPVVVTL), that bound HLA-A*02:01 with high affinity and could induce CD8(+) T-cell responses in vitro. We identified UNC-CDK4-1/HLA-A*02:01 tetramer(+) populations in 3 of 6 patients with acute myeloid leukemia who had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Using tetramer-based, single-cell sorting and T-cell receptor beta (TCRbeta) sequencing, we identified recurrent UNC-CDK4-1 tetramer-associated TCRbeta clonotypes in a patient with a UNC-CDK4-1 tetramer(+) population, suggesting in vivo T-cell expansion to UNC-CDK4-1. In parallel, we measured the patient's TCRbeta repertoire and found it to be highly restricted/oligoclonal. The UNC-CDK4-1 tetramer-associated TCRbeta clonotypes represented >17% of the entire TCRbeta repertoire-far in excess of the UNC-CDK4-1 tetramer(+) frequency-indicating that the recurrent TCRbeta clonotypes identified from UNC-CDK-4-1 tetramer(+) cells were likely a consequence of the extremely constrained T-cell repertoire in the patient and not in vivo UNC-CDK4-1-driven clonal T-cell expansion. Mapping recurrent TCRbeta clonotype sequences onto TCRbeta repertoires can help confirm or refute antigen-specific T-cell expansion in vivo.","['Hunsucker, Sally A', 'McGary, Colleen S', 'Vincent, Benjamin G', 'Enyenihi, Atim A', 'Waugh, Jennifer P', 'McKinnon, Karen P', 'Bixby, Lisa M', 'Ropp, Patricia A', 'Coghill, James M', 'Wood, William A', 'Gabriel, Don A', 'Sarantopoulos, Stefanie', 'Shea, Thomas C', 'Serody, Jonathan S', 'Alatrash, Gheath', 'Rodriguez-Cruz, Tania', 'Lizee, Gregory', 'Buntzman, Adam S', 'Frelinger, Jeffrey A', 'Glish, Gary L', 'Armistead, Paul M']","['Hunsucker SA', 'McGary CS', 'Vincent BG', 'Enyenihi AA', 'Waugh JP', 'McKinnon KP', 'Bixby LM', 'Ropp PA', 'Coghill JM', 'Wood WA', 'Gabriel DA', 'Sarantopoulos S', 'Shea TC', 'Serody JS', 'Alatrash G', 'Rodriguez-Cruz T', 'Lizee G', 'Buntzman AS', 'Frelinger JA', 'Glish GL', 'Armistead PM']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Thirty-two cases of primary mediastinal seminomas were reviewed; and representative whole-tissue sections were selected for immunohistochemical studies using antibodies directed against high molecular weight cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), low molecular weight cytokeratin (CAM5.2), octamer-binding transcription factor 3/4 (OCT3/4), spalt-like transcription factor 4 (SALL4), GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3), sry-related HMG box 2 (SOX2), SOX17, human T cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 (TCL1), glypican 3, melanoma associated antigen C2 (MAGEC2), and paired box gene 8 (Pax8). The percentage of positive tumor cells as well as the intensity of staining was evaluated and scored. Thirty-one cases (97%) expressed SOX17, whereas 29 cases (91%) were positive for OCT3/4 and SALL4, respectively. Twenty-eight cases (88%) expressed MAGEC2 and CAM5.2, respectively. Two cases (6%) were positive for Pax8, and a single case (3%) was positive for TCL1. None of the cases stained with CK5/6, GATA-3, SOX2, or glypican 3. Similar to testicular seminomas, mediastinal seminomas show consistent expression of OCT3/4, SALL4, SOX17, and MAGEC2 and are negative for SOX2, glypican 3, GATA-3, and CK5/6. Pax8 positivity is only inconsistently identified in mediastinal seminomas. Contrary to their testicular counterparts, mediastinal tumors show diffuse expression of low-molecular-weight cytokeratin in up to 90% of cases and are commonly negative for TCL1. Although there is some immunohistochemical overlap between testicular and mediastinal seminomas, considerable differences also exist and should be acknowledged when dealing with these tumors.","['Weissferdt, Annikka', 'Rodriguez-Canales, Jaime', 'Liu, Hui', 'Fujimoto, Junya', 'Wistuba, Ignacio I', 'Moran, Cesar A']","['Weissferdt A', 'Rodriguez-Canales J', 'Liu H', 'Fujimoto J', 'Wistuba II', 'Moran CA']","['Department of Pathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.

METHODS: We retrospectively identified 72 consecutive patients at our institution with ATLL between October 2000 and March 2014. The cases included acute type (n = 20), lymphoma type (n = 21), smouldering type (n = 24) and chronic type (n = 7). Sixteen (7 men, 9 women; aged 36-85 years, mean 63.3 years) of 31 patients (24 with smouldering and seven with chronic type; 51.6 %) developed acute transformation of ATLL, and had undergone chest HRCT examinations. Parenchymal abnormalities, enlarged lymph nodes, pericardial effusion, pleural effusion and skin lesions were evaluated on HRCT. RESULTS: Chest HRCT of 15 of the 16 patients showed abnormal findings, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) (n = 8), consolidation (n = 5), interlobular septal thickening (n = 5) and nodules (n = 5). Pleural effusion was found in five patients, lymph node enlargement in 10 patients and multiple skin thickening in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all patients with acute transformation of ATLL had abnormal findings on chest HRCT, which consisted mainly of lymph node enlargement, GGO, interlobular septal thickening, nodules and bilateral pleural effusions. KEY POINTS: * The recognition of CT findings of acute transformation is important * Almost all patients with acute transformation have abnormal findings on HRCT * Characteristic CT features are present in acute transformation of indolent ATLL.","['Okada, Fumito', 'Sato, Haruka', 'Omeri, Ahmad Khalid', 'Ono, Asami', 'Tokuyama, Kouhei', 'Ando, Yumiko', 'Matsumoto, Akira', 'Ogata, Masao', 'Kohno, Kazuhiro', 'Takano, Kuniko', 'Mori, Hiromu']","['Okada F', 'Sato H', 'Omeri AK', 'Ono A', 'Tokuyama K', 'Ando Y', 'Matsumoto A', 'Ogata M', 'Kohno K', 'Takano K', 'Mori H']","['Department of Radiology, Oita University Faculty of Medicine, 1-1 Idaigaoka, Hasama-machi, Yufu, Oita, 879-5593, Japan, fumitook@oita-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150111,Germany,Eur Radiol,European radiology,9114774,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/complications/*diagnostic imaging', 'Lymph Nodes/diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Pulmonary Nodules/complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Pleural Effusion/complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Radiography, Thoracic/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods', 'Ventricular Septum/diagnostic imaging']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/11 06:00'],"['2014/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00330-014-3565-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Radiol. 2015 Jun;25(6):1607-13. doi: 10.1007/s00330-014-3565-3.

METHODS: Studies were identified and reviewed using specific inclusion criteria. The effect size was odds ratio (OR) of the prevalence of overweight/obese BMI (>/= 25 kg/m(2)) in ALL survivors versus comparison groups. Study data were coded and validated. Fixed-effects (FE) and random-effects (RE) estimates of the effect size were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 9 studies met our inclusion criteria. Survivors were more likely to be overweight/obese compared to comparison groups (FE OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.06-1.18 and RE OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.07-1.53). When limited to studies from North American samples, female survivors were overweight/obese more often than the comparison groups (FE OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.19-1.43). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent and adult survivors of pediatric ALL, especially female survivors, may be at a higher risk of being overweight/obese compared to individuals without cancer. However, few studies provided detailed information on patient and treatment factors (e.g., cranial radiation) that can impact BMI. Standardized reporting of study content is vital for providing robust information on the risk of developing late effects among cancer survivors. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Adolescent and adult survivors of pediatric ALL require additional weight management resources such as targeted counseling for physical activity and dietician support both early in treatment and after the end of their therapy. Female survivors may need additional guidance to develop healthy eating practices and to participate in exercise programs.","['Nam, Gina E', 'Kaul, Sapna', 'Wu, Yelena P', 'Nelson, Richard E', 'Wright, Jennifer', 'Fluchel, Mark N', 'Hacking, Claire C', 'Kirchhoff, Anne C']","['Nam GE', 'Kaul S', 'Wu YP', 'Nelson RE', 'Wright J', 'Fluchel MN', 'Hacking CC', 'Kirchhoff AC']","['Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, 2000 Circle of Hope, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150110,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2016/09/08 06:00,['2015/01/11 06:00'],"['2014/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-014-0415-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2015 Sep;9(3):412-21. doi: 10.1007/s11764-014-0415-x.

OBJECTIVES: Based on systematic reviews (SRs) and published case-control studies, the current evidence on nonallergic comorbidities of AD is summarized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed in Medline and Embase (Search period: through 15 November 2014). RESULTS: In total, nine systematic reviews were included. Six reviews investigating the association between AD and cancer suggested a decreased risk of glioma, meningioma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients with current or previous AD. One SR reported a consistent positive association of AD with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In comparison, two SRs focusing on the relationship between AD and diabetes mellitus type 1 and multiple sclerosis showed that there is no evidence supporting an association. A further screening of individual observational studies concerning immunological and psychiatric diseases pointed out that AD seems to be a significant risk factor for Crohn's disease, affective, schizophrenic, and behavior disorders. CONCLUSION: Further longitudinal studies are needed to verify the existence of causal relationships. Interdisciplinary working groups are desirable to investigate explanations for genetic and physiologic mechanisms of described associations between AD and nonallergic comorbidities.","['Deckert, S', 'Schmitt, J']","['Deckert S', 'Schmitt J']","['Zentrum fur Evidenzbasierte Gesundheitsversorgung (ZEGV), Medizinische Fakultat Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307, Dresden, Deutschland.']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",,Germany,Hautarzt,"Der Hautarzt; Zeitschrift fur Dermatologie, Venerologie, und verwandte Gebiete",0372755,IM,"['Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/*epidemiology', 'Causality', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/*epidemiology', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Incidence', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2015/01/11 06:00'],"['2015/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00105-014-3568-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Hautarzt. 2015 Feb;66(2):103-7. doi: 10.1007/s00105-014-3568-7.,,,,,,,,,,,Nichtallergische Komorbiditaten bei atopischer Dermatitis.,,,,,

CHF6001 was 7- and 923-fold more potent than roflumilast and cilomilast, respectively, in inhibiting PDE4 enzymatic activity (IC50 = 0.026 +/- 0.006 nM). CHF6001 inhibited PDE4 isoforms A-D with equal potency, showed an elevated ratio of high-affinity rolipram binding site versus low-affinity rolipram binding site (i.e., >40) and displayed >20,000-fold selectivity versus PDE4 compared with a panel of PDEs. CHF6001 effectively inhibited (subnanomolar IC50 values) the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, human acute monocytic leukemia cell line macrophages (THP-1), and rodent macrophages (RAW264.7 and NR8383). Moreover, CHF6001 potently inhibited the activation of oxidative burst in neutrophils and eosinophils, neutrophil chemotaxis, and the release of interferon-gamma from CD4(+) T cells. In all these functional assays, CHF6001 was more potent than previously described PDE4 inhibitors, including roflumilast, UK-500,001 [2-(3,4-difluorophenoxy)-5-fluoro-N-((1S,4S)-4-(2-hydroxy-5-methylbenzamido)cyclo hexyl)nicotinamide], and cilomilast, and it was comparable to GSK256066 [6-((3-(dimethylcarbamoyl)phenyl)sulfonyl)-4-((3-methoxyphenyl)amino)-8-methylqui noline-3-carboxamide]. When administered intratracheally to rats as a micronized dry powder, CHF6001 inhibited liposaccharide-induced pulmonary neutrophilia (ED50 = 0.205 mumol/kg) and leukocyte infiltration (ED50 = 0.188 mumol/kg) with an efficacy comparable to a high dose of budesonide (1 mumol/kg i.p.). In sum, CHF6001 has the potential to be an effective topical treatment of conditions associated with pulmonary inflammation, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","['Moretto, Nadia', 'Caruso, Paola', 'Bosco, Raffaella', 'Marchini, Gessica', 'Pastore, Fiorella', 'Armani, Elisabetta', 'Amari, Gabriele', 'Rizzi, Andrea', 'Ghidini, Eleonora', 'De Fanti, Renato', 'Capaldi, Carmelida', 'Carzaniga, Laura', 'Hirsch, Emilio', 'Buccellati, Carola', 'Sala, Angelo', 'Carnini, Chiara', 'Patacchini, Riccardo', 'Delcanale, Maurizio', 'Civelli, Maurizio', 'Villetti, Gino', 'Facchinetti, Fabrizio']","['Moretto N', 'Caruso P', 'Bosco R', 'Marchini G', 'Pastore F', 'Armani E', 'Amari G', 'Rizzi A', 'Ghidini E', 'De Fanti R', 'Capaldi C', 'Carzaniga L', 'Hirsch E', 'Buccellati C', 'Sala A', 'Carnini C', 'Patacchini R', 'Delcanale M', 'Civelli M', 'Villetti G', 'Facchinetti F']","['Corporate Pre-Clinical R & D, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., Parma, Italy (N.M., P.C., R.B., G.M., F.P., E.A., G.A., A.R., E.G., R.D.F., Ca.C., L.C., Ch.C., R.P.

Here we report on the pharmacological profile of volasertib, a potent and selective Plk inhibitor, in multiple preclinical models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) including established cell lines, bone marrow samples from AML patients in short-term culture, and subcutaneous as well as disseminated in vivo models in immune-deficient mice. Our results indicate that volasertib is highly efficacious as a single agent and in combination with established and emerging AML drugs, including the antimetabolite cytarabine, hypomethylating agents (decitabine, azacitidine), and quizartinib, a signal transduction inhibitor targeting FLT3. Collectively, these preclinical data support the use of volasertib as a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of AML patients, and provide a foundation for combination approaches that may further improve and prolong clinical responses.","['Rudolph, Dorothea', 'Impagnatiello, Maria Antonietta', 'Blaukopf, Claudia', 'Sommer, Christoph', 'Gerlich, Daniel W', 'Roth, Mareike', 'Tontsch-Grunt, Ulrike', 'Wernitznig, Andreas', 'Savarese, Fabio', 'Hofmann, Marco H', 'Albrecht, Christoph', 'Geiselmann, Lena', 'Reschke, Markus', 'Garin-Chesa, Pilar', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Moll, Jurgen', 'Adolf, Gunther R', 'Kraut, Norbert']","['Rudolph D', 'Impagnatiello MA', 'Blaukopf C', 'Sommer C', 'Gerlich DW', 'Roth M', 'Tontsch-Grunt U', 'Wernitznig A', 'Savarese F', 'Hofmann MH', 'Albrecht C', 'Geiselmann L', 'Reschke M', 'Garin-Chesa P', 'Zuber J', 'Moll J', 'Adolf GR', 'Kraut N']","['Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria (D.R., M.A.I., U.T.-G., A.W., F.S., M.H.H., C.A., L.G., M.R., P.G.-C., J.M., G.R.A., N.K.);

In this study, we found that the histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase RBP2 (also called JARID1A and KDM5A) is underexpressed in CML-BP. The RBP2 histone demethylase stimulates leukemia cell differentiation and inhibits cell proliferation. We identified miR-21 was directly downregulated by RBP2 and found that miR-21 downregulated PDCD4 expression in leukemia cells. By binding to miR-21 promoter and by demethylating of trimethylated H3K4 at the miR-21 locus, RBP2 downregulated miR-21 expression. This in turn activated PDCD4.

Additionally, the impact of poor adherence in resistance has been little explored. Using sensitive and resistance CML cell lines, we investigated the expression of influx/efflux transporters, like P-gP and OCT1. In the therapeutic interruption model, we observed decrease of influx and increase in efflux transporters combined with BCR-ABL over-expression. Comparatively, resistant cells obtained by continuous TKI exposure only demonstrated alterations in drug's transporters. By exploring P-gP expression of resistant cells, we observed the potential of P-gP inhibitor in circumventing Imatinib resistance. Our results revealed the importance of treatment interruptions for expected response levels and show the complexity of Imatinib resistant process.

To evaluate the cancer-height relationship, we carried out a study using international data, comparing various cancer rates with average adult height of women and men in different countries. METHODS: An ecological analysis of the relationship between country-specific cancer incidence rates and average adult height was conducted for twenty-four anatomical cancer sites. Age-standardized rates were obtained from GLOBOCAN 2008. Average female (112 countries) and male (65 countries) heights were sourced and compiled primarily from national health surveys. Graphical and weighted regression analysis was conducted, taking into account BMI and controlling for the random effect of global regions. RESULTS: A significant positive association between a country's average adult height and the country's overall cancer rate was observed in both men and women. Site-specific cancer incidence for females was positively associated with height for most cancers: lung, kidney, colorectum, bladder, melanoma, brain and nervous system, breast, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, corpus uteri, ovary, and leukemia. A significant negative association was observed with cancer of the cervix uteri. In males, site-specific cancer incidence was positively associated with height for cancers of the brain and nervous system, kidney, colorectum, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, prostate, testicular, lip and oral cavity, and melanoma. CONCLUSION: Incidence of cancer was associated with tallness in the majority of anatomical/cancer sites investigated. The underlying biological mechanisms are unclear, but may include nutrition and early-life exposure to hormones, and may differ by anatomical site.","['Jiang, Yannan', 'Marshall, Roger J', 'Walpole, Sarah C', 'Prieto-Merino, David', 'Liu, Dong-Xu', 'Perry, Jo K']","['Jiang Y', 'Marshall RJ', 'Walpole SC', 'Prieto-Merino D', 'Liu DX', 'Perry JK']","['Department of Statistics, University of Auckland, Auckland, 1023, New Zealand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150110,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Body Height', 'Body Mass Index', 'Ecology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'International Cooperation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research Design', 'Sex Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2016/03/30 06:00,['2015/01/11 06:00'],"['2014/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-014-0520-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2015 Mar;26(3):493-9. doi: 10.1007/s10552-014-0520-1.

Some recent studies have shown that low-level benzene exposure (<1 ppm) disturbs the haematopoietic system. However, other studies showed inconsistent results. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between low-level benzene exposure and blood cell counts in Korean workers. METHODS: Blood cell counts of benzene-exposed workers were extracted from a nationwide Special Health Examination Database from 2000 to 2008. If a worker did not take a blood test for benzene between 2000 and 2004, the worker was selected for analysis. In total, 8679 personal air benzene measurements were extracted from the nationwide Workplace Environment Measurement Database from 2004 to 2008. Mean benzene levels were calculated and assigned to benzene-exposed workers using various combinations of factory/industry/process codes. Mixed-effects models were used to examine dose-related associations between benzene levels and white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), platelet, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. RESULTS: In total, 21 140 blood samples were tested from 10 702 workers between 2005 and 2008; 40% of the workers had repeated blood tests (average, 3.4 times). RBC counts in male workers showed a significant negative association with low-level benzene exposure. WBC, platelet, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts did not show a consistent association with low-level benzene exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the potential haematotoxicity of low-level benzene exposure (<1 ppm). A longitudinal study with direct benzene measurements for exposed workers is needed to confirm the toxicity of low-level benzene exposure.","['Koh, Dong-Hee', 'Jeon, Hee-Kyung', 'Lee, Sang-Gil', 'Ryu, Hyang-Woo']","['Koh DH', 'Jeon HK', 'Lee SG', 'Ryu HW']","[""Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency, Ulsan, Korea [Current affiliation] Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, International St. Mary's Hospital, Catholic Kwandong University, Incheon, Korea."", 'Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency, Ulsan, Korea.', 'Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency, Ulsan, Korea.', 'Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency, Ulsan, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150109,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,"['Adult', 'Air Pollution, Indoor/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Benzene/analysis/*toxicity', '*Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Cells/*drug effects', '*Chemical Industry', 'Environmental Monitoring/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/07/18 06:00,['2015/01/11 06:00'],"['2014/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['oemed-2014-102227 [pii]', '10.1136/oemed-2014-102227 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2015 Jun;72(6):421-7. doi: 10.1136/oemed-2014-102227.

It has been demonstrated that it can promote tumor growth by modulation multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. However, MTDH expression, significance, and related mechanism in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are still unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of MTDH in CLL and the involvement of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in MTDH effects. Overexpression of MTDH mRNAs was seen in CLL samples. MTDH expression was associated with Rai stage classification of CLL, and altered levels of beta2-MG and lactate dehydrogenase in serum samples from patients. Overexpression of MTDH protein was seen in 87 % of CLL samples. Specific siRNAs inhibited MEC-1 cell growth and enhanced cell apoptosis (P < 0.05). Inhibition of MTDH expression resulted in decreased expression levels of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF-1), and its downstream target genes c-myc and cyclin D1. And there was a strong correlation between MTDH and LEF-1 protein expression in 14 patients with CLL. The results demonstrate that MTDH is specifically expressed in B cell of CLL and exert a preservative role through activation of Wnt signaling pathway. Our findings indicated that MTDH may be a potential therapeutic target of CLL.","['Li, Pei-Pei', 'Feng, Li-Li', 'Chen, Na', 'Ge, Xue-Ling', 'Lv, Xiao', 'Lu, Kang', 'Ding, Mei', 'Yuan, Dai', 'Wang, Xin']","['Li PP', 'Feng LL', 'Chen N', 'Ge XL', 'Lv X', 'Lu K', 'Ding M', 'Yuan D', 'Wang X']","['Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, No. 324, Jingwu Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150110,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/*physiology', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2015/01/11 06:00'],"['2014/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-014-0479-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2015 Feb;32(2):479. doi: 10.1007/s12032-014-0479-5.

Detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) has the potential to improve risk stratification, and its routine monitoring may allow timely therapeutic actions such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The current review will discuss challenges and available evidence for clinical application of MRD detection in AML management. RECENT FINDINGS: The heterogeneous nature of AML, variations in genetic aberrations and immunophenotypes among patients and between malignant subclones coexisting within a single patient, is a challenge for the development of a reliable MRD test in AML. MRD value was demonstrated in subtypes of AML in which reliable leukemia-specific genetic marker is present (e.g., core-binding leukemia, AML positive for NPM1 mutation). Multicolor flow cytometry and quantitative PCR monitoring for Wilms tumor 1 gene transcript have also been shown to correlate with disease progression. MRD results should always be interpreted within patient-specific clinical context considering other risk factors and timing of MRD eradication. SUMMARY: Introduction of MRD testing into routine clinical practice is a challenge in AML. An improvement in laboratory techniques along with identification of additional leukemia-specific markers is required.","['Ofran, Yishai', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Ofran Y', 'Rowe JM']","['aDepartment of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Healthcare Campus, Haifa bDepartment of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem cBruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Disease Management', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000113 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2015 Mar;22(2):139-45. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000113.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Newer cytotoxic agents, used as salvage chemotherapy, or in novel conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplant may represent improvement over prior regimens. FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene inhibitors and other targeted therapies currently in clinical trials show promise for select patients. Hypomethylating agents provide benefit to patients who are not candidates for other therapies.

Differential diagnosis of CNL includes reactive or secondary granulocytosis and other myeloid neoplasms, such as atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Herein, we focus on recently described mutations in CNL and their impact on diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2013, membrane-proximal CSF3R mutations, most frequently CSF3RT618I, were described in CNL and aCML. Subsequent studies confirmed the presence of such mutations in nearly all patients with CNL but not in aCML. Furthermore, the majority of the patients with CSF3R-mutated CNL also expressed other mutations, such as SETBP1 and ASXL1, which might be prognostically detrimental. Laboratory studies revealed that CSF3RT618I induced JAK inhibitor-sensitive activation of JAK-STAT and CNL-like disease in mice. Case reports have indicated palliative but not disease-modifying activity of JAK inhibitor therapy in CSF3R-mutated CNL. SUMMARY: CNL is now a morphologically and molecularly defined myeloid malignancy, and no longer a diagnosis of exclusion. The identification of CNL-specific molecular markers provides a much needed pathogenetic insight and also offers the opportunity to revise current diagnostic criteria and identify prognostic biomarkers and potential drug targets.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Elliott, Michelle', 'Pardanani, Animesh']","['Tefferi A', 'Elliott M', 'Pardanani A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Mutation', 'Neutropenia/congenital/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000114 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2015 Mar;22(2):171-6. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000114.,"['0 (CSF3R protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aim at increasing awareness and research in the field of preleukemia that will nurture targeted therapy for the earlier steps of leukemia evolution. RECENT FINDINGS: Emerging evidence supports the role of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells carrying recurrent leukemia-related mutations as the cell of origin of both myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. The preleukemic stem cells can maintain at least to some extent their functionality; however, they have increased fitness endowed by the preleukemic mutations that lead to clonal expansion. SUMMARY: The latent preleukemic period before overt leukemia presents can take years, and the majority of carriers will never develop leukemia in their lifetime. The preleukemic state is not rare, with greater than 1% of individuals having acquired one or more of the recognized preleukemic lesions. The high frequency of such abnormalities in the population may be the cost of growing old; however, another view could be that in order to survive to old age, the hematopoietic system must adapt to create robust hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells with an increased fitness and clonal expansion. Hence, leukemia does not necessarily start as a disease, but rather as a need, with the normally functioning preleukemic hematopoietic stem cells trying to maintain health for years but in time succumbing to their own acquired virtues.","['Shlush, Liran I', 'Minden, Mark D']","['Shlush LI', 'Minden MD']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Progression', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Preleukemia/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000111 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2015 Mar;22(2):77-84. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000111.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although previously considered a subtype of the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), CMML is now recognized as a distinct entity with unique biologic and clinical features. This change has created a scientific and clinical research landscape that makes it difficult to discern CMML-specific validated conclusions versus speculative extrapolation from more general MDS data. RECENT FINDINGS: Here, we review recent biologic observations that support the current CMML WHO classification, such as the high frequency of SRSF2 and ASXL1 mutations compared with MDS and critical dependence of CMML cells on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor signaling. In addition, we discuss CMML-specific prognostic tools and therapeutic results of agents developed for MDS in patients with CMML.

Treatment of relapse post-HSCT is frequently ineffective and outcomes are poor, necessitating preventive strategies that are reviewed below. RECENT FINDINGS: Current strategies to prevent relapse after HSCT are geared towards four general principles: improving the antitumour effects of conditioning regimens prior to HSCT, improving graft selection and engineering to augment the graft-versus-leukaemia effect, post-HSCT chemotherapeutic interventions to impair growth of residual clonal cells and post-HSCT immune-mediated interventions to enhance the graft-versus-leukaemia effect. Strategies based on cell manipulation, namely natural killer (NK) cell enrichment and adoptive T cell transfer, are emerging. Targeted therapies including vaccinations, FLT3 inhibitors, mAbs and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy represent a new avenue of treating acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Studies are underway to incorporate all of these strategies in the clinical setting to determine their impact on relapse and survival after HSCT. SUMMARY: The most recent evidence suggests that strategies using NK cell therapy and targeted immune therapies after HSCT may change the current landscape of HSCT for AML and MDS.","['Kekre, Natasha', 'Koreth, John']","['Kekre N', 'Koreth J']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Donor Selection', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000116 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2015 Mar;22(2):116-22. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000116.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 65% of patients harbor mutations in genes that encode subunits or regulators of the cohesin complex, including NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, and HDAC8. Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WDSTS), which shares CdLS phenotypic features, is caused by mutations in lysine-specific methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A). Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 2 male siblings clinically diagnosed with WDSTS; this revealed a hemizygous, missense mutation in SMC1A that was predicted to be deleterious. Extensive clinical evaluation and WES of 32 Turkish patients clinically diagnosed with CdLS revealed the presence of a de novo heterozygous nonsense KMT2A mutation in 1 patient without characteristic WDSTS features. We also identified de novo heterozygous mutations in SMC3 or SMC1A that affected RNA splicing in 2 independent patients with combined CdLS and WDSTS features. Furthermore, in families from 2 separate world populations segregating an autosomal-recessive disorder with CdLS-like features, we identified homozygous mutations in TAF6, which encodes a core transcriptional regulatory pathway component. Together, our data, along with recent transcriptome studies, suggest that CdLS and related phenotypes may be ""transcriptomopathies"" rather than cohesinopathies.","['Yuan, Bo', 'Pehlivan, Davut', 'Karaca, Ender', 'Patel, Nisha', 'Charng, Wu-Lin', 'Gambin, Tomasz', 'Gonzaga-Jauregui, Claudia', 'Sutton, V Reid', 'Yesil, Gozde', 'Bozdogan, Sevcan Tug', 'Tos, Tulay', 'Koparir, Asuman', 'Koparir, Erkan', 'Beck, Christine R', 'Gu, Shen', 'Aslan, Huseyin', 'Yuregir, Ozge Ozalp', 'Al Rubeaan, Khalid', 'Alnaqeb, Dhekra', 'Alshammari, Muneera J', 'Bayram, Yavuz', 'Atik, Mehmed M', 'Aydin, Hatip', 'Geckinli, B Bilge', 'Seven, Mehmet', 'Ulucan, Hakan', 'Fenercioglu, Elif', 'Ozen, Mustafa', 'Jhangiani, Shalini', 'Muzny, Donna M', 'Boerwinkle, Eric', 'Tuysuz, Beyhan', 'Alkuraya, Fowzan S', 'Gibbs, Richard A', 'Lupski, James R']","['Yuan B', 'Pehlivan D', 'Karaca E', 'Patel N', 'Charng WL', 'Gambin T', 'Gonzaga-Jauregui C', 'Sutton VR', 'Yesil G', 'Bozdogan ST', 'Tos T', 'Koparir A', 'Koparir E', 'Beck CR', 'Gu S', 'Aslan H', 'Yuregir OO', 'Al Rubeaan K', 'Alnaqeb D', 'Alshammari MJ', 'Bayram Y', 'Atik MM', 'Aydin H', 'Geckinli BB', 'Seven M', 'Ulucan H', 'Fenercioglu E', 'Ozen M', 'Jhangiani S', 'Muzny DM', 'Boerwinkle E', 'Tuysuz B', 'Alkuraya FS', 'Gibbs RA', 'Lupski JR']",,['eng'],"['U54 HG006542/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54HG006542/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150109,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Codon, Nonsense', '*De Lange Syndrome/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Exome', 'Exonucleases', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Heterozygote', 'Histone Deacetylases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Phenotype', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Transcriptome']",PMC4319410,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/04/11 06:00,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2014/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['77435 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI77435 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2015 Feb;125(2):636-51. doi: 10.1172/JCI77435.

Overall, one or more genetic lesions correlate with expression levels of ~20% of all genes, explaining 20-65% of observed expression variability. Differential expression patterns vary between mutations and reflect the underlying biology, such as aberrant polycomb repression for ASXL1 and EZH2 mutations or perturbed gene dosage for copy-number changes. In predicting survival, genomic, transcriptomic and diagnostic clinical variables all have utility, with the largest contribution from the transcriptome.

RO3280 was recently identified as a novel PLK1 inhibitor; however its therapeutic effects in leukemia treatment are still unknown. We found that the PLK1 protein was highly expressed in leukemia cell lines as well as 73.3% (11/15) of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. PLK1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in AML samples compared with control samples (82.95 +/- 110.28 vs. 6.36 +/- 6.35; p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that shorter survival time correlated with high tumor PLK1 expression (p = 0.002). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of RO3280 for acute leukemia cells was between 74 and 797 nM. The IC50 of RO3280 in primary acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and AML cells was between 35.49 and 110.76 nM and 52.80 and 147.50 nM, respectively. RO3280 induced apoptosis and cell cycle disorder in leukemia cells. RO3280 treatment regulated several apoptosis-associated genes. The regulation of DCC, CDKN1A, BTK, and SOCS2 was verified by western blot. These results provide insights into the potential use of RO3280 for AML therapy; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined.","['Wang, Na-Na', 'Li, Zhi-Heng', 'Zhao, He', 'Tao,

Despite major improvement in outcome, it remains a life-threatening malignancy. Demographic and clinical data on pediatric AML is lacking among the Lebanese population. PURPOSE: We aimed to identify clinical, molecular and outcome data in children with AML in Lebanon. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of children with AML diagnosed in three Lebanese hospitals during the past 8 years was conducted. RESULTS: From May 2002 through March 2010, we identified 24 children with AML in Saint George Hospital University Medical Center, University Medical Center Rizk Hospital, and Abou-Jaoude Hospital. Males and females were equally represented; median age at diagnosis was 9 years (range 1-24) and median WBC at diagnosis was 31 x 10(9)/L (range: 2.1-376 x 10(9)/L). Twenty five percent of patients (6 out of 24) had acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Karyotype was normal in 33% of patients; t(8;21), inv (16), t(8;9), t(7;11), t(9;11), complex chromosomal abnormality, monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 were the most common cytogenetic abnormalities encountered. Patients were treated on different European and North American protocols. Twelve patients (50%) achieved morphologic CR after cycle 1, 6 of them (50%) had bone marrow relapse within 11 months from diagnosis. Nine patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant, and 3 of them are alive at 5 years post-transplant. Early death rate was 16.6% of patients, mainly those with APL and a presenting WBC > 10 x 10(9)/L. Fifty per cent of APL patients had an early death due to DIC despite starting ATRA therapy. Overall, median survival for AML patients who died from disease progression was 25.8 months (range: 1-60 months). Overall disease-free survival was 30.4%. Patients < 10 years of age had a 50% survival rate compared to 0% in patients > 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our report highlights the needs in Lebanon for better supportive care of children with APL, including faster ATRA administration and, aggressive transfusions, easy access to stem cell transplant for high-risk AML patients and the need for a national homogenous treatment strategy for children with AML.","['Farah, Roula A', 'Horkos, Jessy G', 'Bustros, Youssef D', 'Farhat, Hussein Z', 'Abla, Oussama']","['Farah RA', 'Horkos JG', 'Bustros YD', 'Farhat HZ', 'Abla O']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Saint George Hospital University Medical Center, Beirut-Lebanon.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Saint George Hospital University Medical Center, Beirut-Lebanon.', 'Department of Surgery, Saint George Hospital University Medical Center, Beirut-Lebanon.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Medical Center Rizk Hospital, Beirut- Lebanon.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Toronto Sick Children's Hospital.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150101,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,PMC4283923,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/01/13 06:01,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2014/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2015.012 [doi]', 'mjhid-7-1-e2015012 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2015 Jan 1;7(1):e2015012. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2015.012. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to study the prognostic value of Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) expression in Egyptian children with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on fifty children with newly diagnosed B-lineage ALL, admitted to Oncology Unit, Pediatric Department, Tanta University Hospitals in the period from August 2010 to March 2014. This series included 32 males and 18 females with ages ranging from 3-17 years and a mean value of 9 +/- 3.5 years. Twenty healthy children, age and sex matched, were also included in this study as a control group. For all patients, the following examens were done: Bone marrow aspiration, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping and estimation of Neuropilin-1 expression on blast cells by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The present study revealed highly significant differences in Neuropilin-1 expression between B-lineage ALL lymphoblasts and control lymphocytes. A significant higher Neuropilin-1 expression was found in pre-B ALL (74.04%) compared with early pre-B (23.55%). Neuropilin-1 positive expression was associated with significantly higher white blood cells count (Mean = 69.3+/-18.53 x10(3)/mm(3) versus 32.5+/-11.64 x10(3)/mm(3) and p=0.003), bone marrow blasts percentage (Mean=76.12+/-21.4 % versus 41.2+/-19.71% and p= 0.003), serum lactate dehydrogenase levels (Mean=1992.2 +/- 58.6 unit/L versus 955.1+/- 234.7 unit/L and p=0.001) at diagnosis compared with negative Neuropilin-1 expression. The levels of Neuropilin-1 on BM blasts at diagnosis were higher in patients who subsequently relapsed (Mean=53.8 +/- 27.1) or later died (Mean=81.51 +/- 9.94) during the period of follow-up compared to those who achieved and maintained complete remission (Mean=18.17 +/- 10.4) with p value of 0.001. Furthermore, patients with higher Neuropilin-1 expression had significantly shorter overall survival (Median 27.99 months and p= 0.0133) and disease-free survival (Median=10.23 months and p= 0.0002) than patients with low Neuropilin-1 expression (Median disease-free survival was 38.7 months). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that Neuropilin-1 is a poor prognosis factor in children with B-lineage ALL and so we recommend the inclusion of Neuropilin-1 as a prognostic marker in children with B-lineage ALL. Its presence at high levels suggests a poor prognosis, and the necessity of intensive therapeutic intervention.","['Hagag, Adel A', 'Nosair, Nahla A']","['Hagag AA', 'Nosair NA']","['Pediatric Department, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150101,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,PMC4283925,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/01/13 06:01,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2014/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2015.009 [doi]', 'mjhid-7-1-e2015009 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2015 Jan 1;7(1):e2015009. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2015.009. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to prolonged administration of IM, the questions about the possible impact on the development of secondary malignancies (SM) are raised. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and clinical outcome of secondary malignancies during IM therapy for CML. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The records of 221 CML patients treated with IM between 2003-2013 in a single institution were reviewed. The Poisson regression model was used to estimate the relative risks for SM and death in CML patients. RESULTS: Secondary malignancies developed in eight out of the 221 patients (3.6%) receiving IM for a median of 61 months (range, 10-137 months). Female/male ratio was 5/3. Two patients were diagnosed with their CML at accelerated phase whereas 6 had chronic phase. The median age at IM initiation was 58 years (range, 31-72 years). Five of these 8 SM patients received IM after other treatments failure: interferon alpha (n=5), hydroxyurea (n=4) and cytarabine (n=1). Three patients received IM as a frontline therapy. All patients were on IM at 400mg daily at SM occurrence. The therapy for SM included surgery (n=3), chemotherapy only (n=3), and chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (n=1). One patient did not receive treatment due to disseminated disease. All CML patients were in hematologic and complete cytogenetic response (CCR) at the time of SM development. All of them also met the criteria for major molecular response (BCR-ABL(IS) </=0.1%). They continued their IM while receiving treatment for SM. Among eight patients with SM, five patients are alive and remain in CCR on IM whereas three patients died due to SM. The risks for SM development as well as death due to SM in CML patients were not statistically increased if compared to age-adjusted population. CONCLUSIONS: The association between IM therapy for CML and SM development has not been found.","['Helbig, Grzegorz', 'Bober, Grazyna', 'Seweryn, Marek', 'Wichary, Ryszard', 'Tukiendorf, Andrzej', 'Sedlak, Lech', 'Oleksy, Tomasz', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien, Slawomira']","['Helbig G', 'Bober G', 'Seweryn M', 'Wichary R', 'Tukiendorf A', 'Sedlak L', 'Oleksy T', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien S']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Statistics, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Student Research Group, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.', 'Student Research Group, Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150101,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,PMC4283924,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/01/13 06:01,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2014/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2015.003 [doi]', 'mjhid-7-1-e2015003 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2015 Jan 1;7(1):e2015003. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2015.003. eCollection 2015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 325 Chinese patients with CHB were enrolled in this retrospective, hospital-based study. Patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), or primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) were included, with healthy donors acting as controls. A panel of autoantibodies that serologically define AIH and PBC was tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay and line immunoassay. The AIH-related autoantibody profile included homogeneous anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA-H), smooth-muscle antibodies, anti-liver kidney microsome type 1, anti-liver cytosolic antigen type 1, and anti-soluble liver antigen/liver pancreas; the PBC-related antibodies were characterized by ANA-nuclear dots/membranous rim-like, anti-mitochondrial antibodies-M2 (AMA-M2), anti-BPO (recombinant antigen targeted by AMA-M2), anti-Sp100, anti-promyelocytic leukemia protein (anti-PML), and anti-gp210. The dichotomization of clustering was used to unequivocally designate the AIH or PBC profiles for each case. Anti-Ro52 antibodies were also tested. RESULTS: The prevalence of any autoantibody in CHB amounted to 58.2%, which was similar to the 66.2% prevalence in CHC, significantly higher than the 6.7% in the healthy controls (P < 0.001), and lower than the 100% found in AIH and PBC (P = 0.004 and P < 0.001, respectively). There were more anti-PML and anti-gp210 antibodies among the CHB patients than the CHC patients (11.1% vs 0%, P = 0.003; 12.6% vs 0%, P < 0.001, respectively). The prevalence and titer of AMA, anti-BPO, anti-PML, and anti-gp210 were higher in PBC than in those with CHB. Among the CHB patients, the prevalence of ANA, especially ANA-H, was significantly lower in patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis compared with patients without cirrhosis. Thirty-eight cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in CHB showed a significant difference compared with non-HCC patients in the prevalence of anti-PML (0% vs 12.5%, P = 0.013). Dichotomization of the autoantibodies revealed that the PBC profile was more prevalent in patients with CHB than in those with CHC, and that it was strongly correlated with both compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. In contrast, the prevalence of the AIH profile was significantly higher in non-cirrhosis patients with CHB than in those with compensated cirrhosis (18.5% vs 8.2%, P = 0.039). Moreover, the AIH profile was also closely associated with hepatitis B e-antigen positivity. CONCLUSION: ANA-H could be an indicator of early-stage CHB. Dichotomizing the autoantibody profiles revealed that the PBC profile is strongly associated with cirrhosis in CHB.","['Li, Bo-An', 'Liu, Jia', 'Hou, Jun', 'Tang, Jie', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Xu, Jun',

Cancer stem cells (CSCs), which were first identified in acute myeloid leukemia and subsequently in a large array of solid tumors, play important roles in cancer initiation, dissemination and recurrence. CSCs are often transformed tissue-specific stem cells or de-differentiated transit amplifying progenitor cells. Several populations of multipotent gastric stem cells (GSCs) that reside in the stomach have been determined to regulate physiological tissue renewal and injury repair. These populations include the Villin+ and Lgr5+ GSCs in the antrum, the Troy+ chief cells in the corpus, and the Sox2+ GSCs that are found in both the antrum and the corpus. The disruption of tumor suppressors in Villin+ or Lgr5+ GSCs leads to GC in mouse models. In addition to residing GSCs, bone marrow-derived cells can initiate GC in a mouse model of chronic Helicobacter infection. Furthermore, expression of the cell surface markers CD133 or CD44 defines gastric CSCs in mouse models and in human primary GC tissues and cell lines. Targeted elimination of CSCs effectively reduces tumor size and grade in mouse models. In summary, the recent identification of normal GSCs and gastric CSCs has greatly improved our understanding of the molecular and cellular etiology of GC and will aid in the development of effective therapies to treat patients.","['Zhao, Yue', 'Feng, Fei', 'Zhou, Yong-Ning']","['Zhao Y', 'Feng F', 'Zhou YN']","['Yue Zhao, Yong-Ning Zhou, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, the First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Key Laboratory for Gastrointestinal Disease of Gansu Province, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Province, China.', 'Yue Zhao, Yong-Ning Zhou, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, the First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Key Laboratory for Gastrointestinal Disease of Gansu Province, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Province, China.', 'Yue Zhao, Yong-Ning Zhou, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, the First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Key Laboratory for Gastrointestinal Disease of Gansu Province, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Province, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cadherins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/pathology', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Helicobacter Infections/complications/microbiology', 'Helicobacter pylori/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/metabolism/microbiology/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/microbiology/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/microbiology/*pathology/therapy']",PMC4284326,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/09/15 06:00,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2014/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3748/wjg.v21.i1.112 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2015 Jan 7;21(1):112-23. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v21.i1.112.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CDH1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD133', 'CD44', 'Cancer stem cells', 'E-cadherin', 'Gastric cancer', 'Lgr5', 'Sox2', 'Troy', 'Villin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe the characteristics, causes of discontinuation, and outcomes in patients who discontinued treatment with ibrutinib. One hundred twenty-seven patients were enrolled in various clinical trials of ibrutinib, with or without rituximab, at our center. Thirty-three (26%) patients have discontinued ibrutinib to date. The majority of those patients had high-risk features: 94% with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene rearrangement, 58% with del(17p) by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and 54% with a complex karyotype. Causes of discontinuation were disease transformation (7), progressive CLL (7), stem cell transplantation (3), adverse events (11), serious adverse events/deaths (3), and miscellaneous reasons (2). Twenty five patients (76%) died after discontinuing ibrutinib; the median overall survival was 3.1 months after discontinuation. Most patients with RR-CLL who discontinued ibrutinib early were difficult to treat and had poor outcomes.","['Jain, Preetesh', 'Keating, Michael', 'Wierda, William', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Jain, Nitin', 'George, Binsah', 'James, Danelle', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Burger, Jan', ""O'Brien, Susan""]","['Jain P', 'Keating M', 'Wierda W', 'Estrov Z', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Jain N', 'George B', 'James D', 'Kantarjian H', 'Burger J', ""O'Brien S""]","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical School at Houston, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Pharmacyclics, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20150108,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/chemically induced', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/mortality', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', '*Withholding Treatment/statistics & numerical data']",PMC4467871,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31860-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-09-603670 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Mar 26;125(13):2062-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-09-603670.

To identify mechanisms of TKI resistance that are independent of BCR-ABL1 kinase activity, we introduced a lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library targeting approximately 5000 cell signaling genes into K562(R), a CML cell line with BCR-ABL1 kinase-independent TKI resistance expressing exclusively native BCR-ABL1. A customized algorithm identified genes whose shRNA-mediated knockdown markedly impaired growth of K562(R) cells compared with TKI-sensitive controls. Among the top candidates were 2 components of the nucleocytoplasmic transport complex, RAN and XPO1 (CRM1). shRNA-mediated RAN inhibition or treatment of cells with the XPO1 inhibitor, KPT-330 (Selinexor), increased the imatinib sensitivity of CML cell lines with kinase-independent TKI resistance. Inhibition of either RAN or XPO1 impaired colony formation of CD34(+) cells from newly diagnosed and TKI-resistant CML patients in the presence of imatinib, without effects on CD34(+) cells from normal cord blood or from a patient harboring the BCR-ABL1(T315I) mutant. These data implicate RAN in BCR-ABL1 kinase-independent imatinib resistance and show that shRNA library screens are useful to identify alternative pathways critical to drug resistance in CML.","['Khorashad, Jamshid S', 'Eiring, Anna M', 'Mason, Clinton C', 'Gantz, Kevin C', 'Bowler, Amber D', 'Redwine, Hannah M', 'Yu, Fan', 'Kraft, Ira L', 'Pomicter, Anthony D', 'Reynolds, Kimberly R', 'Iovino, Anthony J', 'Zabriskie, Matthew S', 'Heaton, William L', 'Tantravahi, Srinivas K', 'Kauffman, Michael', 'Shacham, Sharon', 'Chenchik, Alex', 'Bonneau, Kyle', 'Ullman, Katharine S', ""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Deininger, Michael W']","['Khorashad JS', 'Eiring AM', 'Mason CC', 'Gantz KC', 'Bowler AD', 'Redwine HM', 'Yu F', 'Kraft IL', 'Pomicter AD', 'Reynolds KR', 'Iovino AJ', 'Zabriskie MS', 'Heaton WL', 'Tantravahi SK', 'Kauffman M', 'Shacham S', 'Chenchik A', 'Bonneau K', 'Ullman KS', ""O'Hare T"", 'Deininger MW']","['Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; Beijing Tsinghua Chang Gung Hospital, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics, Natick, MA; and.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics, Natick, MA; and.', 'Cellecta, Mountain View, CA.', 'Cellecta, Mountain View, CA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, The University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT;']",['eng'],"['P01CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA093247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA042014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA093247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P30CA042014-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA042014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA178397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150108,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/pharmacology', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Karyopherins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Triazoles/pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'ran GTP-Binding Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",PMC4357584,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35164-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-08-588855 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Mar 12;125(11):1772-81. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-08-588855.

Induction of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) has been shown to exert beneficial effects in different liver injury models. Therefore, we examined the effect of pretreating rats with cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), an HO-1 inducer, on apoptosis in liver during BD and elucidated the mechanisms involved. First, rats were killed at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after BD induction to examine the expression of hepatic HO-1. Second, rats were randomly divided into four groups (n=6): (S group) rats undergoing sham operation, (CS group) rats pretreated with CoPP for 24 h before the sham operation, (B group) rats undergoing BD for 6 h, (CB group) rats pretreated with CoPP for 24 h before BD induction. The expression levels of hepatic HO-1 mRNA and protein in rats increased at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6h after BD induction, compared with sham operated rats. In the CB group compared with the B group, the increased hepatic expression of HO-1 correlated with a significant decrease in serum ALT/AST levels, fewer apoptotic cells in liver, increased hepatic expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, and decreased hepatic expression of Bax, cytosolic cytochrome c and cleaved caspase-3. CoPP inhibits apoptosis in liver of BD rats in part via modulating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.

The results from testing thousands of cells reveal that lymphocytes from CLL patients have higher stiffness (i.e., lower deformability), as compared to lymphocytes in healthy samples, which was also confirmed by AFM indentation tests.

Mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene are uncommon in infant MLL-ALL, and drugs that release p53 from inhibitory mechanisms may be beneficial. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of the orally available nutlin, RG7112, against patient-derived MLL-ALL xenografts. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eight MLL-ALL patient-derived xenografts were established in immune-deficient mice, and their molecular features compared with B-lineage ALL and T-ALL xenografts. The sensitivity of MLL-ALL xenografts to RG7112 was assessed in vitro and in vivo, and the ability of RG7112 to induce p53, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis in vivo was evaluated. RESULTS: Gene-expression analysis revealed that MLL-ALL, B-lineage ALL, and T-ALL xenografts clustered according to subtype. Moreover, genes previously reported to be overexpressed in MLL-ALL, including MEIS1, CCNA1, and members of the HOXA family, were significantly upregulated in MLL-ALL xenografts, confirming their ability to recapitulate the clinical disease. Exposure of MLL-ALL xenografts to RG7112 in vivo caused p53 upregulation, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis. RG7112 as a single agent induced significant regressions in infant MLL-ALL xenografts. Therapeutic enhancement was observed when RG7112 was assessed using combination treatment with an induction-type regimen (vincristine/dexamethasone/L-asparaginase) against an MLL-ALL xenograft. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of targeting the p53-MDM2 axis in combination with established drugs for the management of infant MLL-ALL warrants further investigation.","['Richmond, Jennifer', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Evans, Kathryn', 'High, Laura', 'Mendomo, Agnes', 'Robbins, Alissa', 'Meyer, Claus', 'Venn, Nicola C', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Henderson, Michelle', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Kurmasheva, Raushan T', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Smith, Malcolm A', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Richmond J', 'Carol H', 'Evans K', 'High L', 'Mendomo A', 'Robbins A', 'Meyer C', 'Venn NC', 'Marschalek R', 'Henderson M', 'Sutton R', 'Kurmasheva RT', 'Kees UR', 'Houghton PJ', 'Smith MA', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/Diagnostic Center of Acute Leukemia (DCAL), Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/Diagnostic Center of Acute Leukemia (DCAL), Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."", ""Center for Childhood Cancer, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", 'Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", 'Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia. rlock@ccia.unsw.edu.au.""]",['eng'],"['N01 CM042216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-91001-03/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CM42216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA199297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150108,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin A1/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Imidazolines/*therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4359964,['NIHMS654865'],2015/01/13 06:00,2016/02/05 06:00,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-14-2300 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-2300 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2015 Mar 15;21(6):1395-405. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-2300.

In most patients, the disease is diagnosed at advanced stages and cannot be cured using conventional therapeutic approaches. To assess the role of cytogenetic abnormalities in therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (tMNs), we studied the clinicopathologic and cytogenetic features of treated FL patients who subsequently developed a new acquired cytogenetic clone (ACC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five treated FL patients developed new cytogenetic abnormalities from 2009 to 2012. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on the presence and absence of tMNs: group 1, ACC without tMNs after a median follow-up of 15 months; group 2, ACC with possible tMN after silent ACC detection; group 3, tMNs present at the first ACC detection. RESULTS: The most frequent cytogenetic aberrations involved chromosome 7. Compared with group 1, group 3 had significantly greater size of ACC, higher frequency of chromosome 7 aberrations, more likely showed dysplasia, and lower platelet count (P = .03). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the presence of ACC alone is insufficient for diagnosis of tMNs. The proportion of cells with specific aberrations at first ACC, bone marrow dysplasia, and low platelet counts might predict outcome of ACC.","['Wang, Xiaohong I', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Qazilbash, Muzaffar H', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Lu, Gary']","['Wang XI', 'Yin CC', 'Qazilbash MH', 'Hu S', 'Lu G']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UT Health Medical School, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplant, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

We aimed to develop a protocol for the efficient isolation and in vitro expansion of donor-derived Treg and to establish the proof-of-concept for the clinical application of ex vivo-generated Treg preparations in five patients with otherwise treatment-refractory chronic GvHD (cGvHD). METHODS: Allogeneic Treg were isolated from unstimulated leukapheresis products of the corresponding human leukocyte antigen-matched donors by use of clinical-grade magnetic-activated bead sorting. To increase the amount and purity, Treg were cultivated for 7-12 days and infused after a median time of 35 months after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. RESULTS: Final products contained Treg with a median purity of 84.1% CD4(+)CD25(high)CD127(low)FOXP3(+)of CD45(+) cells and a mean quantity of 2.4 x 10(6) Treg per kg body wt. All isolated cell products showed in vitro suppressive activity. On transfusion, two of five patients showed a clinical response with improvement of cGvHD symptoms. The other three patients showed stable cGvHD symptoms for up to 21 months. In four of five patients, increased counts of Treg were detectable on Treg transfusion, immunosuppressive treatment could be reduced and suppression of CD69 activation marker expression on T-effector cells was observed. However, one patient had development of malignant melanoma and another patient had Bowen skin cancer 4 months and 11 months after Treg transfusion, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a feasible and reproducible approach of isolating functional Treg in high quantity and purity for clinical application and show opportunities and risks of adoptive Treg transfer into patients with cGvHD.","['Theil, Anke', 'Tuve, Sebastian', 'Oelschlagel, Uta', 'Maiwald, Anja', 'Dohler, Diana', 'Ossmann, Dennis', 'Zenkel, Anja', 'Wilhelm, Carmen', 'Middeke, Jan Moritz', 'Shayegi, Nona', 'Trautmann-Grill, Karolin', 'von Bonin, Malte', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Bonifacio, Ezio', 'Bornhauser, Martin']","['Theil A', 'Tuve S', 'Oelschlagel U', 'Maiwald A', 'Dohler D', 'Ossmann D', 'Zenkel A', 'Wilhelm C', 'Middeke JM', 'Shayegi N', 'Trautmann-Grill K', 'von Bonin M', 'Platzbecker U', 'Ehninger G', 'Bonifacio E', 'Bornhauser M']","['DFG Center for Regenerative Therapies, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'DFG Center for Regenerative Therapies, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'DFG Center for Regenerative Therapies, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany; Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'DFG Center for Regenerative Therapies, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'DFG Center for Regenerative Therapies, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany; Medical Clinic I, University Hospital Dresden, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.

METHODS: Retrospective analyses were conducted for 4 patients with T315I mutation of CML undergoing allo-HSCT from June 2012 to January 2014, including 2 cases in acceleration phase and 2 in chronic phase. There were 2 males and 2 females with ages from 26 to 45 years. Two patients received HLA-matched sibling allo-geneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT) while another 2 unrelated cord blood stem cell transplantation (UCBT). No splenomegaly was found before transplantation. One case had F317L mutation. All of them were treated with imatinib before transplantation. And the time from medication to T315I mutation was 20-35 months. All of them were conditioned with myeloablative regimen and received a combination of cyclosporine A (CsA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for preventing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). RESULTS: Myeloid implantation was achieved in all of them. The time of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >/= 0.5x10(9)/L were 10-28 days. One patient whose platelet was not implanted died from severe pulmonary infection at Day 88 post-transplantation. For 3 patients, platelet >/= 20x10(9)/L were 15-33 days. But the marrow short tandem repeat (STR)-PCR was 100% donor type at the time of 30 days post-transplantation in all patients. One case of UCBT developed pre-implantation immune response syndrome (PES) and one acute GVHD of gradeI at Day 12 after allo-PBSCT. However both were controlled after treatment with methylprednisolone. And 1/3 evaluatable patients developed chronic GVHD. BCR/ABL transcript was detected by qualitative PCR after transplantation. And all BCR/ABL fusion genes turned negative after 30 days of transplantation. Up to the follow-up endpoint, there was no relapse except for one mortality.

Consecutive bone marrow samples of 498 patients, including 70 therapy-related (28 MDS and 42 AML) and 428 de novo (147 MDS and 281 AML) were analyzed using a modified-TruSeq Amplicon Cancer Panel (Illumina) covering mutation hotspots of 53 genes. Overall, mutation(s) were detected in 58.6% of t-MDS/AML and 56.8% of de novo MDS/AML. Of therapy-related cases, mutations were detected in 71.4% of t-AML versus 39.3% t-MDS (p=0.0127). TP53 was the most common mutated gene in t-MDS (35.7%) as well as t-AML (33.3%), significantly higher than de novo MDS (17.7%) (p=0.0410) and de novo AML (12.8%) (p=0.0020). t-AML showed more frequent PTPN11 but less NPM1 and FLT3 mutations than de novo AML. In summary, t-MDS/AML shows a mutation profile different from their de novo counterparts. TP53 mutations are highly and similarly prevalent in t-MDS and t-AML but mutations in genes other than TP53 were more frequent in t-AML than t-MDS. The molecular genetic profiling further expands our understanding in this group of clinically aggressive yet heterogeneous myeloid neoplasms.","['Ok, Chi Young', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Routbort, Mark J', 'Fu, Bin', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Goswami, Maitrayee', 'Singh, Rajesh', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Pierce, Sherry A', 'Young, Ken H', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Wang, Sa A']","['Ok CY', 'Patel KP', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Routbort MJ', 'Fu B', 'Tang G', 'Goswami M', 'Singh R', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Pierce SA', 'Young KH', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Luthra R', 'Wang SA']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Hematology, Central South University Xiangya Hospital, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

Following incubation with various concentrations of ZGDHu1, fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) was used in order to detect changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability in Kasumi1 cells. Western blot analysis was performed in order to analyze the expression of nuclear factorkappaB, inhibitor of kappaB and AML1/ETO. In addition FACS was used to analyze leukemia cell cycles and the expression levels of cyclin, cyclindependent kinases and cyclindependent kinase inhibitors in G2/M phase were determined using FACS and western blot analysis. The upregulation of reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial membrane permeability was ascribed to apoptosis. The growth of Kasumi1 cells was inhibited through the downregulation of nuclear factorkappaB, degradation of AML1/ETO fusion protein and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. This study documented that G2/M regulatory molecules, including cyclin B1, cell division control (cdc)2 and cdc25c were downregulated and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), p53, p27, phosphocdc25c, phosphoCHK1 and phosphop53 were upregulated following treatment with ZGDHu1. In the present study, pretreatment with CHIR124, a selective CHK1 inhibitor, abrogated G2/M arrest via ZGDHu1. These results demonstrated the antitumor activity of ZGDHu1, which may therefore a potential target for further investigation and may be useful for the treatment of patients with t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia.","['Xia, Jun', 'Chen, Su-Feng', 'Lv, Ya-Ping', 'Lu, Ling-Na', 'Hu, Wei-Xiao', 'Zhou, Yong-Lie']","['Xia J', 'Chen SF', 'Lv YP', 'Lu LN', 'Hu WX', 'Zhou YL']","[""Centre of Laboratory Medicine, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, P.R.

We studied the kinetics of BCR-ABL1 transcript in 41 Ph+ B-LL patients in correlation with their clinical outcome. A total of 23 patients achieved complete molecular remission at 6 months post-treatment. This was associated with a lower relapse risk and better overall survival. Likewise, sustainable complete molecular remission in 27 patients was associated with superior clinical outcome. Sporadic low level BCR-ABL1 was detected in 12 of 27 patients who had attained complete molecular remission. The relapse rate was significantly higher in non-transplant patients with persistent positive BCR-ABL1 than patients transplanted when BCR-ABL1 was detectable. All eight patients harboring ABL1 kinase domain mutations died of disease or were transferred to hospice care. We concluded that monitoring the level of BCR-ABL1 transcript after hematologic remission has predictive value to the long-term outcome.","['Zhang, Linsheng', 'Ramjit, Ruan T', 'Hill, Charles E', 'Arellano, Martha', 'Khoury, H Jean', 'Mann, Karen P']","['Zhang L', 'Ramjit RT', 'Hill CE', 'Arellano M', 'Khoury HJ', 'Mann KP']","['a Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine , Emory University , Atlanta, Georgia.', 'a Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine , Emory University , Atlanta, Georgia.', 'a Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine , Emory University , Atlanta, Georgia.', 'b Division of Hematology/Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University , Atlanta, Georgia.', 'b Division of Hematology/Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University , Atlanta, Georgia.', 'a Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine , Emory University , Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150806,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/01/13 06:01,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:01 [medline]', '2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428194.2014.1003059 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2016 Feb;57(2):364-369. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2014.1003059.

In this study, we sought to evaluate risk factors for IMD in our patient population. METHODS: Between May 2007 and July 2009, all HCT recipients from 8 Brazilian centers were followed prospectively until 1 year post transplant. Cases of IMD were classified as early (before day +40) or late (after day +40). Patients with IMD (cases) were compared with controls (patients without IMD) using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Among 345 HCT recipients, 28 IMDs were diagnosed. Risk factors for early IMD were acute myeloid leukemia (hazard ratio [HR] 2.95, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.13-7.68, P = 0.03) and transplant with a human leukocyte antigen-mismatched donor (HR 3.38, 95% CI 1.18-9.68, P = 0.02), and for late IMD risk factors were lymphoma (HR 8.49, 95% CI 2.35-30.68, P = 0.001), cytomegalovirus reactivation (HR 5.51, 95% CI 1.15-26.47, P = 0.03), and neutropenia (HR 3.49, 95% CI 1.01-12.13, P = 0.049). CONCLUSION: The variables identified in this study may help to define risk groups, and to tailor special preventive measures to patients at higher risk to develop IMD.","['Atalla, A', 'Garnica, M', 'Maiolino, A', 'Nucci, M']","['Atalla A', 'Garnica M', 'Maiolino A', 'Nucci M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150109,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brazil', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cytomegalovirus/*physiology', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Virus Activation', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2017/04/14 06:00,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2014/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tid.12328 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2015 Feb;17(1):7-13. doi: 10.1111/tid.12328.

The prostate cancer cell line PC-3 was lentivirally transfected to silence endogenous MLF1IP gene expression, which was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Cellomics ArrayScan VTI imaging and MTT assays were conducted to assess cell proliferation. Cell cycle phase arrest and apoptosis were assayed by flow cytometry. Colony formation was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. MLF1IP gene expression was also analyzed by RT-qPCR in sixteen prostate cancer tissue samples and six healthy control prostate tissue samples from human patients. Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited in MLF1IP-silenced cells relative to control cells. G1 phase, S and G2/M phase cell counts were not significantly changed in MLF1IP-silenced cells relative to control cells. Apoptosis was significantly increased in MLF1IP-silenced cells, while MLF1IP-silenced cells displayed a significantly reduced number of cell colonies, compared to control cells. The 16 human prostate cancer tissue samples revealed no clear upregulation or downregulation in MLF1IP gene expression. MLF1IP significantly promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and colony formation and significantly inhibits apoptosis without affecting cell cycle phase arrest. Further study is required to conclusively determine whether MLF1IP is upregulated in human prostate cancer tumors and to determine the precise cellular mechanism(s) for MLF1IP in prostate carcinogenesis.","['Zhang, Lei', 'Ji, Guoqing', 'Shao, Yuzhang', 'Qiao, Shaoyi', 'Jing, Yuming', 'Qin, Rongliang', 'Sun, Huiming', 'Shao, Chen']","['Zhang L', 'Ji G', 'Shao Y', 'Qiao S', 'Jing Y', 'Qin R', 'Sun H', 'Shao C']","[""Department of Epidemiology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, 710032, Shaanxi, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150109,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcriptome', 'Transfection']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/10/16 06:00,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-014-0454-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2015 Feb;32(2):454. doi: 10.1007/s12032-014-0454-1.

Notwithstanding limitations, existence of refractory/progressive disease at allografting yields worse nonrelapse mortality, more relapse and inferior overall survival. Advanced age results in higher nonrelapse mortality and increased relapse risk. Presence of poor-risk cytogenetics increases post-transplant relapse risk, but its impact on overall survival appears controversial. Developing prognostic models using large multicenter data could help better understand the effect of these and other variables on post-transplant outcomes. Newly discovered mutations as well as response (or not) to new potent therapies, such as ibrutinib or others, would likely be incorporated in such models.","['Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A']",['Kharfan-Dabaja MA'],"['Department of Blood & Marrow Transplantation, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, 12902 Magnolia Drive, FOB-3, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Immunotherapy,Immunotherapy,101485158,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Allografts', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*mortality/*therapy', '*Models, Biological', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/imt.14.100 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunotherapy. 2015;7(1):47-56. doi: 10.2217/imt.14.100.,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",['NOTNLM'],"['allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'prognostic markers', 'reduced intensity conditioning']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the activity and mechanisms of ATO in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A panel of SCLC cell lines (H841, DMS79, H526, H69 and H187) was employed to demonstrate the activity of ATO. Cell viability, apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane depolarization were assessed. Western blotting was performed to determine the alteration of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic mediators. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) (hydrogen peroxide and superoxide) and intracellular glutathione (GSH) were measured. Antioxidants, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), were applied to restore GSH content and reduce production of ROS. All SCLC cell lines were relatively sensitive to ATO with IC50 values below 10 microM. ATO induced cell death mainly through apoptosis in H841 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Hydrogen peroxide was the major ROS in SCLC cells induced by ATO. Along with GSH depletion and Bcl-2 downregulation, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization was enhanced, followed by release of AIF and SMAC from mitochondria to initiate different cell death pathways. NAC reversed cell death and molecular changes induced by ATO via restoring GSH and reducing ROS content. BHA inhibited hydrogen peroxide production completely and partially restored GSH content accounting for partial reversal of cell inhibition and mitochondrial dysfunction. Nonetheless, ATO reduced both reduced and oxidized form of thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) with no effect on Trx1 redox potential. ATO led to cell death in SCLC mainly through mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting from altered cellular redox homeostasis, namely, hydrogen peroxide generation, GSH depletion and Trx1 downregulation.","['Zheng, Chun-Yan', 'Lam, Sze-Kwan', 'Li, Yuan-Yuan', 'Ho, James Chung-Man']","['Zheng CY', 'Lam SK', 'Li YY', 'Ho JC']","['Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, SAR, P.R.

This neoplasia is characterized by male predominance, high-risk features and poor outcome, mainly in recurrence patients and adults. In recent years, advances in the success of childhood ALL treatment were verified, and the rate of cure is over 80 % of individuals. However, there is a considerable scope for improving therapeutic outcome in this neoplasia. Improvements in ALL therapy might readily be achieved by developing additional biomarkers that can predict and refine prognosis in patients with ALL. In normal hematopoietic cells, cytokines provide the stimulus for proliferation, survival, self-renewal, differentiation and functional activation. Abnormalities of cytokines are characteristic in all forms of leukemia, including ALL. The stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12) is a member of the CXC chemokine family that binds to CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis appears to play a role in dissemination of solid tumors and hematopoietic diseases. Understanding the mechanisms by which ALL cells are disseminated will provide additional information to expand therapeutic approach. Therefore, this review summarizes information relating to ALL cell biology, focusing specifically in a cytokine receptor important axis, CXCL12/CXCR4, that may have implications for novel treatment strategies to improve life expectancy of patients with this neoplasia.","['de Lourdes Perim, Aparecida', 'Amarante, Marla Karine', 'Guembarovski, Roberta Losi', 'de Oliveira, Carlos Eduardo Coral', 'Watanabe, Maria Angelica Ehara']","['de Lourdes Perim A', 'Amarante MK', 'Guembarovski RL', 'de Oliveira CE', 'Watanabe MA']","['Laboratory of Hematology, Department of Pathology, Clinical and Toxicological Analysis, Health Sciences Center, State University of Londrina, Av.

Ruxolitinib reduces splenomegaly and systemic symptoms in myelofibrosis and improves overall survival; however, the mechanism by which JAK inhibitors achieve efficacy has not been delineated. Patients with MPN present with increased levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines, which are mitigated by JAK inhibitor therapy. We sought to elucidate mechanisms by which JAK inhibitors attenuate cytokine-mediated pathophysiology. Single-cell profiling demonstrated that hematopoietic cells from myelofibrosis models and patient samples aberrantly secrete inflammatory cytokines. Pan-hematopoietic Stat3 deletion reduced disease severity and attenuated cytokine secretion, with similar efficacy as observed with ruxolitinib therapy. In contrast, Stat3 deletion restricted to MPN cells did not reduce disease severity or cytokine production. Consistent with these observations, we found that malignant and nonmalignant cells aberrantly secrete cytokines and JAK inhibition reduces cytokine production from both populations. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that JAK-STAT3-mediated cytokine production from malignant and nonmalignant cells contributes to MPN pathogenesis and that JAK inhibition in both populations is required for therapeutic efficacy. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms by which JAK kinase inhibition achieves therapeutic efficacy in MPNs.","['Kleppe, Maria', 'Kwak, Minsuk', 'Koppikar, Priya', 'Riester, Markus', 'Keller, Matthew', 'Bastian, Lennart', 'Hricik, Todd', 'Bhagwat, Neha', 'McKenney, Anna Sophia', 'Papalexi, Efthymia', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Rampal, Raajit', 'Marubayashi, Sachie', 'Chen, Jonathan J', 'Romanet, Vincent', 'Fridman, Jordan S', 'Bromberg, Jacqueline', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Murakami, Masato', 'Radimerski, Thomas', 'Michor, Franziska', 'Fan, Rong', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Kleppe M', 'Kwak M', 'Koppikar P', 'Riester M', 'Keller M', 'Bastian L', 'Hricik T', 'Bhagwat N', 'McKenney AS', 'Papalexi E', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Rampal R', 'Marubayashi S', 'Chen JJ', 'Romanet V', 'Fridman JS', 'Bromberg J', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Murakami M', 'Radimerski T', 'Michor F', 'Fan R', 'Levine RL']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.

Some studies indicated the association of diagnosed WT1 higher expression (WT1(H)) and poor outcome in the AML patients, while other studies had different opinions. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the controversial prognostic significance of diagnosed WT1(H) in AML. Eligible studies were identified from several databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library (up to September 2014). The primary end point was overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was chosen as secondary end point. If possible, we would pool estimate effects (hazard ratio [HR] with 95 % confidence interval [CI]) of outcomes in both fixed and random effects models. Eleven studies, covering 1497 AML patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled HRs indicated that diagnosed WT1(H) had a poor impact on the survival of AML patients (HR for OS, 1.37; HR for DFS, 1.38). Furthermore, diagnosed WT1(H) appeared to be an adverse prognostic indicator in adult AML (HR for OS, 1.43; HR for DFS, 1.41) and non-promyelocytic AML (non-M3 AML) (HR for OS, 1.46; HR for DFS, 1.41). Diagnosed WT1(H) had slightly but significantly poor prognostic impact on OS and DFS of patients with AML in total population and some specific subgroups.","['Yi-Ning, Yang', 'Xiao-rui, Wang', 'Chu-xian, Zhao', 'Chun, Wang', 'You-wen, Qin']","['Yi-Ning Y', 'Xiao-rui W', 'Chu-xian Z', 'Chun W', 'You-wen Q']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai JiaoTong University Affiliated Shanghai General Hospital, No. 100 Haining Rd., Shanghai, 200080, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20150110,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'WT1 Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/07/25 06:00,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2014/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-014-2295-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Jun;94(6):929-38. doi: 10.1007/s00277-014-2295-6.

In multivariate analysis, overall survival (OS) was inferior in minor MM hematopoietic cell transplantations (median 2.1 versus 6.3 years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19 to 2.05; P = .001) in comparison with ABO-matched grafts.

The study combines four approaches, i.e., cell viability, apoptosis rate, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and immunoblotting to develop personalized therapy protocols based on the cell sensitivity to drug exposure of individual CLL patients. The complementary analyses were performed on 28 peripheral blood samples from previously untreated CLL patients before therapy. The induction and progress of apoptosis in CLL cells exposed in vitro to purine analogs combined with mafosfamide, i.e., cladribine + mafosfamide (CM) and fludarabine + mafosfamide (FM) were assessed using the above approaches. The changes in thermal profiles (decrease/loss of transition at 95+/-5 C) coincided with an accumulation of apoptotic cells, a decrease in the number of viable cells, and differences in the expression of the apoptosisrelated protein PARP1. No significant changes were observed in the thermal profiles of nuclei isolated from CLL cells resistant to the treatment. The complementary assays revealed a strong relationship between both the in vitro sensitivity of leukemia cells to drugs and the clinical response of the patients, determined usually after the sixth course of treatment (after ~6 months of therapy). As a summary of studies followed by complementary tests, our findings demonstrate the value of in vitro exposure of CLL cell samples to drugs intended to treat CLL patients, before their administration in order to recommend the most suitable and effective therapy for individual patients.","['Rogalinska, Malgorzata', 'Blonski, Jerzy Z', 'Goralski, Pawel', 'Wawrzyniak, Ewa', 'Hartman, Mariusz', 'Rogalska, Aneta', 'Robak, Pawel', 'Koceva-Chyla, Aneta', 'Piekarski, Henryk', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Kilianska, Zofia M']","['Rogalinska M', 'Blonski JZ', 'Goralski P', 'Wawrzyniak E', 'Hartman M', 'Rogalska A', 'Robak P', 'Koceva-Chyla A', 'Piekarski H', 'Robak T', 'Kilianska ZM']","['Department of Cytobiochemistry, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Physical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Cytobiochemistry, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Thermobiology, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Thermobiology, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Physical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Cytobiochemistry, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150108,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,,2015/01/13 06:00,2015/10/06 06:00,['2015/01/10 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2015.2823 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2015 Mar;46(3):1259-67. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2015.2823.

METHODS: Human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CEM was cultured in vitro. The 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of oridonin against CEM cells was examined using modified MTT assay. The cellular morphologic changes were observed using a light microscope. The percent of apoptosis of CEM cells after drug treatment was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis. The active levels of AKT/mTOR, RAF/MEK/ ERK, STAT5 signaling pathways and the expression levels of Bcl-2 and BAX were examined by Western blot. RESULTS: Oridonin inhibited the growth of CEM cells in time- and dose dependent manner and the ICs0 of oridonin was (7. 37+/- 1. 99) mumol/L after 72 h treatment. The cellular membrane of CEM cells treated with oridonin became unsharp, some of them disintegrated. Oridonin induced apoptosis in CEM cells and the percent of apoptosis rate after 0, 5, 7.5, 10 mumol/L oridonin treatment for 24 h were (4. 8+/-2. 11)%, (19.03+/-12.54)% ,(40.27+/- 3.31) / and (57. 23 +/- 6. 69)% respectively. Oridonin inhibited activation of mTOR, P70S6, 4EBP1, RAF. ERK and STAT5 signaling protein, which were constitutively activated in CEM cells, however, oridonin had no inhibitory effect on AKT kinase. Oridonin down-regulated the level of anti apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and up-regulated the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax. CONCLUSION: Oridonin exerted antileukemia effect in CEM cells by inhibiting the activation of mTOR/P70/4EBP1, RAF/ERK and STATS signaling pathways, down-regulating the expression of Bel-2 and up-regulating the expression of BAX.","['Guo, Yong', 'Shan, Qing-qing', 'Gong, Yu-ping', 'Lin, Juan', 'Yang, Xi']","['Guo Y', 'Shan QQ', 'Gong YP', 'Lin J', 'Yang X']","['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Sichuan da xue xue bao.

The experimental group was given fentanyl 1 to 2 mug/kg intravenously first, then etomidate 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg intravenously after the pipe washed. The patients younger than 1.5 years or who did not achieve satisfied sedative and analgesic situation received an additional time of etomidate (0.1-0.3 mg/kg). The patients were given oxygen at the rate of 4-5 L/min during the whole operation, and the finger pulse oximeter was used simultaneously to detect the changes in heart rate (HR) and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). The doctors who performed the procedures assessed the quality of sedation and analgesia.In the experimental group, the patients' HR increased slightly after given fentanyl combined with etomidate. The patients' SpO2 was stable. Most patients achieved a good sedative and analgesic state within 1 to 2 minutes, and no case of respiration depression or cardiac arrhythmias occurred during the whole operation. The wake-up time was 55.42 +/- 20.62 min. In the control group, the patients were not very cooperative during the intrathecal injection, which made the procedures very difficult.During intrathecal injection, pain obviously reduced and the success rate of single lumbar puncture increased. It is safe and effective to apply fentanyl combined with etomidate for sedation and analgesia.","['Yang, Chun-Hui', 'Tian, Xin', 'Yin, Hai-Bin', 'Gao, Xiao-Hui', 'Li, Na']","['Yang CH', 'Tian X', 'Yin HB', 'Gao XH', 'Li N']","[""From the Dali University, Dali (C-HY, X-HG); Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Kunming Medical University (XT, NL); and Kunming Medical University, Kunming, Yunnan, PR China (H-BY).""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['Anesthetics, Intravenous/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Etomidate/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fentanyl/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Pain/etiology/*prevention & control']",PMC4602823,,2015/01/09 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2015/01/09 06:00'],"['2015/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000000361 [doi]', '00005792-201501010-00020 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2015 Jan;94(1):e361. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000000361.,"['0 (Anesthetics, Intravenous)', 'UF599785JZ (Fentanyl)', 'Z22628B598 (Etomidate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between January 2010 and December 2011, all children following stem cell transplantation (SCT) or with HR leukemia were prospectively included. Serum samples for GMA were taken once-twice weekly. Results >.5 were considered positive. Patients suspected of having IPA were stratified as possible, probable, and definite. Forty-six children (median age, 8 years) were included, 38 after SCT (32 allogeneic), 8 with HR leukemia. A total of 510 samples were taken; screening period was 1-6 months for 34 patients. GMA was negative in 28 patients, all but one without suspicion of IPA. Eighteen patients had positive GMA: while four (22%) were upgraded to probable IPA, fourteen (78%) were considered as false positives (FP), some associated with piperacillin-tazobactam treatment. GMA sensitivity and specificity were 0.8 and 0.66, respectively; positive- and negative-predictive values (PPV, NPV) were 0.22 and 0.96, respectively. GMA may have a role in evaluating HR children for IPA. Both NPV and FP rates are high.

We have previously demonstrated that p30(II) interacts with the c-MYC oncoprotein and enhances c-MYC-dependent transcriptional and oncogenic functions. However, the molecular and biochemical events that mediate the cooperation between p30(II) and c-MYC remain to be completely understood. Herein we demonstrate that p30(II) induces lysine-acetylation of the c-MYC oncoprotein. Acetylation-defective c-MYC Lys-->Arg substitution mutants are impaired for oncogenic transformation with p30(II) in c-myc(-/-) HO15.19 fibroblasts. Using dual-chromatin-immunoprecipitations (dual-ChIPs), we further demonstrate that p30(II) is present in c-MYC-containing nucleoprotein complexes in HTLV-1-transformed HuT-102 T-lymphocytes. Moreover, p30(II) inhibits apoptosis in proliferating cells expressing c-MYC under conditions of genotoxic stress. These findings suggest that c-MYC-acetylation is required for the cooperation between p30(II)/c-MYC which could promote proviral replication and contribute to HTLV-1-induced carcinogenesis.","['Romeo, Megan M', 'Ko, Bookyung', 'Kim, Janice', 'Brady, Rebecca', 'Heatley, Hayley C', 'He, Jeffrey', 'Harrod, Carolyn K', 'Barnett, Braden', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Lairmore, Michael D', 'Martinez, Ernest', 'Luscher, Bernhard', 'Robson, Craig N', 'Henriksson, Marie', 'Harrod, Robert']","['Romeo MM', 'Ko B', 'Kim J', 'Brady R', 'Heatley HC', 'He J', 'Harrod CK', 'Barnett B', 'Ratner L', 'Lairmore MD', 'Martinez E', 'Luscher B', 'Robson CN', 'Henriksson M', 'Harrod R']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design, and Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design, and Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design, and Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design, and Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design, and Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design, and Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design, and Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design, and Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, USA.', 'Departments of Medicine and Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.', 'University of California-Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95618, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, Klinikum, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52057 Aachen, Germany.', 'Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, The Medical School, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Microbiology, Cell and Tumor Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, and The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design, and Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX 75275-0376, USA.

Monacolin K inhibits the proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but underlying mechanisms remain to be identified. The present study demonstrates that monacolin K inhibits the proliferation of human AML cell line U937 in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, morphological, DNA fragmentation, and image cytometry analyses indicated that monacolin K induced U937 cell apoptosis. Monacolin K could inactivate Ras translocation from cytosol to cell membrane. Monacolin K could also reduce the Ras-dependent phosphorylation of ERK and Akt, and the subsequent translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) from cytosol to nucleus in U937 cells. The underlying mechanisms of apoptotic activity of monacolin K were associated with inhibition of the Ras/Raf/ERK and Ras/PI3K/Akt signals and down-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase and glyoxalase 1. On the basis of results obtained using specific inhibitors U0126, LY294002, and JSH-23, the Ras/Raf/ERK/NF-kappaB/GLO1 and Ras/Akt/NF-kappaB/GLO1 pathways were proposed for the apoptotic effect of monacolin K in U937 cells.","['Chen, Chun-Chia', 'Wu, Mei-Li', 'Ho, Chi-Tang', 'Huang, Tzou-Chi']","['Chen CC', 'Wu ML', 'Ho CT', 'Huang TC']","['Department of Food Science, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology , Pingtung 91201, Taiwan.', 'Department of Food Science, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology , Pingtung 91201, Taiwan.', 'Department of Food Science, Rutgers University , New Brunswick, New Jersey 08901, United States.', 'Department of Food Science, National Pingtung University of Science and Technology , Pingtung 91201, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150122,United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,,,,,2015/01/09 06:00,2015/01/09 06:01,['2015/01/09 06:00'],"['2015/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/09 06:01 [medline]', '2015/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jf505275s [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2015 Feb 4;63(4):1186-1195. doi: 10.1021/jf505275s.

This step is subjective and scarcely reproducible. Therefore, the development of subjective and potentially automatable methods for the recognition of typical AML/MDS cells is necessary. Here we have used Raman spectroscopy for distinguishing myeloblasts, promyelocytes, abnormal promyelocytes and erhytroblasts, which have to be counted for a correct diagnosis and morphological classification of AML and MDS. BM samples from patients affected by four different AML subtypes, mostly characterized by the presence of the four subpopulations selected for this study, were analyzed. First, each cell was scanned by acquiring 4096 spectra, thus obtaining Raman images which demonstrate an accurate description of morphological features characteristic of each subpopulation. Raman imaging coupled with hierarchical cluster analysis permitted the automatic discrimination and localization of the nucleus, the cytoplasm, myeloperoxidase containing granules and haemoglobin. Second, the averaged Raman fingerprint of each cell was analysed by multivariate analysis (principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis) in order to study the typical vibrational features of each subpopulation and also for the automatic recognition of cells. The leave-one-out cross validation of a Raman-based classification model demonstrated the correct classification of myeloblasts, promyelocytes (normal/abnormal) and erhytroblasts with an accuracy of 100%. Normal and abnormal promyelocytes were distinguished with 95% accuracy. The overall classification accuracy considering the four subpopulations was 98%. This proof-of-concept study shows that Raman micro-spectroscopy could be a valid approach for developing label-free, objective and automatic methods for the morphological classification and counting of cells from AML/MDS patients, in substitution of the manual examination of BM and PB stained smears.","['Vanna, R', 'Ronchi, P', 'Lenferink, A T M', 'Tresoldi, C', 'Morasso, C', 'Mehn, D', 'Bedoni, M', 'Picciolini, S', 'Terstappen, L W M M', 'Ciceri, F', 'Otto, C', 'Gramatica, F']","['Vanna R', 'Ronchi P', 'Lenferink AT', 'Tresoldi C', 'Morasso C', 'Mehn D', 'Bedoni M', 'Picciolini S', 'Terstappen LW', 'Ciceri F', 'Otto C', 'Gramatica F']","['Laboratory of Nanomedicine and Clinical Biophotonics, Fond.

Imatinib-resistant chronic phase CML patients treated with dasatinib (n=10) and nilotinib (n=12) were enrolled. The mRNA expression of the OCT-1, ABCG2, and ABCB1 genes was quantified by using paired bone marrow samples obtained before administering imatinib and at the point of detecting imatinib resistance (just before starting second-generation TKIs). The expression levels of OCT-1 and ABCG2 were lower in follow-up than in imatinib-naive samples. ABCB1 revealed highly variable expression levels before and after imatinib treatment. In addition, median ABCB1 expression in follow-up samples was lower in patients achieving complete cytogenetic response or major molecular response during imatinib treatment than in failed patients. Higher ABCG2 expression in imatinib-exposed samples showed a negative impact on optimal response to dasatinib. Patients with higher ABCG2 expression in imatinib-exposed samples also had shorter progression- free survival with dasatinib treatment. However, no significant correlation was found between these drug transporter expression levels in imatinib-naive or imatinib- exposed samples and responses to nilotinib. In imatinib-resistant CML, OCT-1 and ABCG2 mRNA expression decreased after imatinib treatment. Patients with higher ABCG2 expression in imatinib-exposed samples showed poor treatment outcome with dasatinib. On the other hand, a higher expression level of ABCB1 in imatinib-exposed samples did not affect second-generation TKI responses but was correlated with poor imatinib responses.","['Kim, Yeo-Kyeoung', 'Lee, Seung-Shin', 'Jeong, Sung-Hoon', 'Ahn, Jae-Sook', 'Yang, Deok-Hwan', 'Lee, Je-Jung', 'Shin, Myung-Geun', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon']","['Kim YK', 'Lee SS', 'Jeong SH', 'Ahn JS', 'Yang DH', 'Lee JJ', 'Shin MG', 'Kim HJ']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hematology Clinics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hematology Clinics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hematology Clinics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hematology Clinics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hematology Clinics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hematology Clinics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Hematology Clinics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Gwangju, Korea. ; Genome Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141217,Korea (South),Chonnam Med J,Chonnam medical journal,101564659,,,PMC4276791,,2015/01/09 06:00,2015/01/09 06:01,['2015/01/09 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4068/cmj.2014.50.3.102 [doi]'],ppublish,Chonnam Med J. 2014 Dec;50(3):102-11. doi: 10.4068/cmj.2014.50.3.102.

The major therapeutic challenge is the characterization of the leukemic stem cell as a target for the eradication of the disease. Until now the biology of AML-associated fusion proteins (AAFPs), such as the t(15;17)-PML/RARalpha, t(8;21)-RUNX1/RUNX1T1 and t(6;9)-DEK/NUP214, all able to induce AML in mice, was investigated in different models and genetic backgrounds, not directly comparable to each other. To avoid the bias of different techniques and models we expressed these three AML-inducing oncogenes in an identical genetic background and compared their influence on the HSC compartment in vitro and in vivo. These AAFPs exerted differential effects on HSCs and PML/RARalpha, similar to DEK/NUP214, induced a leukemic phenotype from a small subpopulation of HSCs with a surface marker pattern of long-term HSC and characterized by activated STAT3 and 5. In contrast the established AML occurred from mature populations in the bone marrow. The activation of STAT5 by PML/RARalpha and DEK/NUP214 was confirmed in t(15;17)(PML/RARalpha) and t(6;9)(DEK/NUP214)-positive patients as compared to normal CD34+ cells. The activation of STAT5 was reduced upon the exposure to Arsenic which was accompanied by apoptosis in both PML/RARalpha- and DEK/NUP214-positive leukemic cells. These findings indicate that in AML the activation of STATs plays a decisive role in the biology of the leukemic stem cell. Furthermore we establish exposure to arsenic as a novel concept for the treatment of this high risk t(6;9)-positive AML.","['Oancea, Claudia', 'Ruster, Brigitte', 'Brill, Boris', 'Roos, Jessica', 'Heinssmann, Maria', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Mian, Afsar Ali', 'Guillen, Nathalie Andrea', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Henschler, Reinhard', 'Ruthardt, Martin']","['Oancea C', 'Ruster B', 'Brill B', 'Roos J', 'Heinssmann M', 'Bug G', 'Mian AA', 'Guillen NA', 'Kornblau SM', 'Henschler R', 'Ruthardt M']","['Department of Hematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Biomedical Research, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany ; University Clinic Munich, Department for Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapy and Hemostaseology, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,PMC4279436,,2015/01/09 06:00,2015/01/09 06:01,['2015/01/09 06:00'],"['2014/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/09 06:01 [medline]']","['39 [pii]', '10.18632/genesandcancer.39 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2014 Nov;5(11-12):378-92. doi: 10.18632/genesandcancer.39.,,['NOTNLM'],"['STAT5', 'arsenic trioxide', 'leukemia initiating cell', 't(6:9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although several anti-HIV cellular microRNAs have been described, such a regulation for HTLV-1 has not been reported. In this study, we found that miR-28-3p inhibits HTLV-1 virus expression and its replication by targeting a specific site within the genomic gag/pol viral mRNA. Because miR-28-3p is highly expressed in resting T cells, which are resistant to HTLV-1 infection, we investigated a potential protective role of miR-28-3p against de novo HTLV-1 infection. To this end, we developed a new sensitive and quantitative assay on the basis of the detection of products of reverse transcription. We demonstrate that miR-28-3p does not prevent virus receptor interaction or virus entry but, instead, induces a post-entry block at the reverse transcription level. In addition, we found that HTLV-1, subtype 1A isolates corresponding to the Japanese strain ATK-1 present a natural, single-nucleotide polymorphism within the miR-28-3p target site. As a result of this polymorphism, the ATK-1 virus sequence was not inhibited by miR-28. Interestingly, genetic studies on the transmission of the virus has shown that the ATK-1 strain, which carries a Thr-to-Cys transition mutation, is transmitted efficiently between spouses, suggesting that miR-28 may play an important role in HTLV-1 transmission.","['Bai, Xue Tao', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Bai XT', 'Nicot C']","['From the University of Kansas Medical Center, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Center for Viral Oncology, Kansas City, Kansas 66160.', 'From the University of Kansas Medical Center, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Center for Viral Oncology, Kansas City, Kansas 66160 cnicot@kumc.edu.']",['eng'],"['P30 GM103326/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI058944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI058944/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150107,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HTLV-I Infections/*genetics/virology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation, Missense', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",PMC4342455,,2015/01/09 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2015/01/09 06:00'],"['2015/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)46816-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.626325 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Feb 27;290(9):5381-90. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.626325.

His clinical course was troubled by recurrent hospitalisations and complications that delayed investigations and potential treatments. Radiographic findings revealed stable CLL, mild sigmoid diverticulitis and a small renal mass. Small renal masses (less than 4 cm) are considered low risk for metastasising and are, thus, often observed or ablated, rather than resected. Furthermore, gastrointestinal metastases from RCC are rare.

The purpose of the present study was to further evaluate the biologic significance of the CD22DeltaE12 molecular lesion and determine if it could serve as a molecular target for corrective repair using RNA trans-splicing therapy. We show that both pediatric and adult B-lineage lymphoid malignancies are characterized by a very high incidence of the CD22DeltaE12 genetic defect. We provide experimental evidence that the correction of the CD22DeltaE12 genetic defect in human CD22DeltaE12(+) BPL cells using a rationally designed CD22 RNA trans-splicing molecule (RTM) caused a pronounced reduction of their clonogenicity. The RTM-mediated correction replaced the downstream mutation-rich segment of Intron 12 and remaining segments of the mutant CD22 pre-mRNA with wildtype CD22 exons 10-14, thereby preventing the generation of the cis-spliced aberrant CD22DeltaE12 product. The anti-leukemic activity of this RTM against BPL xenograft clones derived from CD22DeltaE12(+) leukemia patients provides the preclinical proof-of-concept that correcting the CD22DeltaE12 defect with rationally designed CD22 RTMs may provide the foundation for therapeutic innovations that are needed for successful treatment of high-risk and relapsed BPL patients.","['Uckun, Fatih M', 'Qazi, Sanjive', 'Ma, Hong', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Mitchell, Lloyd G']","['Uckun FM', 'Qazi S', 'Ma H', 'Reaman GH', 'Mitchell LG']","[""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA), Mailstop 160, 4650 Sunset Boulevard, Smith Research Tower Suite 300-316, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. uckun@usc.edu fmuckun@chla.usc.edu.""]",['eng'],"['R43 CA177067/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R43CA177067/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA154471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA151837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01-CA-151837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Integr Biol (Camb),Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro,101478378,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*genetics', 'Targeted Gene Repair/*methods', '*Trans-Splicing', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4373651,['NIHMS654381'],2015/01/09 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/09 06:00'],"['2015/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c4ib00221k [doi]'],ppublish,Integr Biol (Camb). 2015 Feb;7(2):237-49. doi: 10.1039/c4ib00221k.,"['0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data for children with at least one CT between 1980 and 2010 were abstracted from 20 hospitals. Cancer cases occurring between 1980 and 2010 were identified by stochastic linkage with the German Childhood Cancer Registry (GCCR). For all cases and a sample of non-cases, radiology reports were reviewed to assess the underlying medical conditions at time of the CT. Cases were only included if diagnosis occurred at least 2 years after the first CT and no signs of cancer were recorded in the radiology reports. Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) using incidence rates from the general population were estimated. The cohort included information on 71,073 CT examinations in 44,584 children contributing 161,407 person-years at risk with 46 cases initially identified through linkage with the GCCR. Seven cases had to be excluded due to signs possibly suggestive of cancer at the time of first CT. Overall, more cancer cases were observed (O) than expected (E), but this was mainly driven by unexpected and possibly biased results for lymphomas. For leukaemia, the SIR (SIR = O/E) was 1.72 (95 % CI 0.89-3.01, O = 12), and for CNS tumours, the SIR was 1.35 (95 % CI 0.54-2.78, O = 7). Despite careful examination of the medical information, confounding by indication or reverse causation cannot be ruled out completely and may explain parts of the excess. Furthermore, the CT exposure may have been underestimated as only data from the participating clinics were available. This should be taken into account when interpreting risk estimates.","['Krille, L', 'Dreger, S', 'Schindel, R', 'Albrecht, T', 'Asmussen, M', 'Barkhausen, J', 'Berthold, J D', 'Chavan, A', 'Claussen, C', 'Forsting, M', 'Gianicolo, E A L', 'Jablonka, K', 'Jahnen, A', 'Langer, M', 'Laniado, M', 'Lotz, J', 'Mentzel, H J', 'Queisser-Wahrendorf, A', 'Rompel, O', 'Schlick, I', 'Schneider, K', 'Schumacher, M', 'Seidenbusch, M', 'Spix, C', 'Spors, B', 'Staatz, G', 'Vogl, T', 'Wagner, J', 'Weisser, G', 'Zeeb, H', 'Blettner, M']","['Krille L', 'Dreger S', 'Schindel R', 'Albrecht T', 'Asmussen M', 'Barkhausen J', 'Berthold JD', 'Chavan A', 'Claussen C', 'Forsting M', 'Gianicolo EAL', 'Jablonka K', 'Jahnen A', 'Langer M', 'Laniado M', 'Lotz J', 'Mentzel HJ', 'Queisser-Wahrendorf A', 'Rompel O', 'Schlick I', 'Schneider K', 'Schumacher M', 'Seidenbusch M', 'Spix C', 'Spors B', 'Staatz G', 'Vogl T', 'Wagner J', 'Weisser G', 'Zeeb H', 'Blettner M']","['Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University Medical Center Mainz, Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 69, 55131, Mainz, Germany.', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer, 69372, Lyon, France.', 'Leibniz -

However, fluoroquinolone use has been associated with development of multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli. Due to a presumed risk of multi-drug resistance associated with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, patients admitted to our hospital with neutropenic fever receive empiric carbapenem therapy until cultures are negative for 72 h or identification of an organism. Our study seeks to identify the incidence of multi-drug-resistant organism colonization and bacteremia among patients who receive fluoroquinolone prophylaxis and to evaluate duration of empiric carbapenem therapy. A retrospective review of adult patients with acute leukemia receiving a fluoroquinolone as outpatient infection prophylaxis, admitted to our tertiary cancer center for treatment of neutropenic fever was completed. Surveillance and blood cultures were reviewed for antibiotic resistance. Duration of empiric carbapenem therapy was reviewed. One hundred patients and 177 admissions for neutropenic fever were included. Six patients harbored a piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant organism found during routine surveillance. Among these patients, two bacteremias were identified, one of which was a piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant organism. Five bacteremias were identified among 83 patients with negative surveillance cultures. Among the bloodstream infections, five organisms isolated were fluoroquinolone resistant. No cefepime-resistant organism was isolated on surveillance or bloodstream cultures. Adherence to the institution guideline of narrowing antibiotics after 72 h of negative cultures occurred in only 13% of neutropenic fever cases. The average duration of carbapenem therapy in 177 neutropenic fever episodes was 4.4 days. Our findings show that among our patient population, there is a low risk of bacteremia with a piperacillin-tazobactam-resistant or cefepime-resistant organism.

METHODS: PL-DNR was prepared by dry lipid hydration and remote loading, and its physicochemical indexes were analyzed. The inhibiting effect of PL-DNR on leukemia cells was observed in terms of in vitro cytotoxicity experiment. The therapeutic effect in vivo was assessed by tumor inhibition in leukemia L1210-bearing mice. Apoptosis in cardiomyocytes was detected using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling method (TUNEL staining). RESULTS: The average diameter of PL-DNR was (110 +/- 10)nm and the encapsulation efficiency was 94.21%. The in vitro cytotoxicity experiment showed that the inhibiting ability of PL-DNR in the treatment groups was continuously enhanced as the experiment proceeded. The in vivo pharmacodynamic experiment also indicated obvious tumor-inhibiting effect of PL-DNR. At the end of the experiment, the tumor volume of the PL-DNR group was (433.71 +/- 234.77)mm(3), significantly smaller than that of (1 293.77 +/- 381.26) mm(3) in the DNR group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the tumor weight of the PL-DNR group was (0.66 +/- 0.29)g and that of the DNR group was (1.25 +/- 0.43)g (P < 0.05). The myocardial toxicity experiment showed that the median apoptosis index of cardiomyocytes in the PL-DNR group was 13.83%, significantly lower than that of 42.67% in the DNR group (P < 0.05), indicating a lower toxicity of PL-DNR to the myocardium.

METHODS: In total, 263 Chinese intermediate-risk AML patients treated with anthracycline and cytarabine were enrolled. G2677T, C1236T, and C3435T of the ABCB1 gene were analyzed by the allele-specific matrix-assisted laser desorption. Expression of ABCB1 messenger RNA (mRNA) was tested in 101 patients of known genotype and haplotype for ABCB1 polymorphisms. Basic clinical characteristics of these patients were collected from medical records. RESULTS: Survival analysis showed that patients with AML (TTT haplotype) had a longer overall survival (OS) (p < 0.001, 29.2 months, 95 % confidence interval [CI], 26.9-31.5 months) and relapse-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.005, 21.8 months, 95 % CI, 19.5-24.0 months) compared with those without TTT haplotype (21.9 months, 95 % CI, 19.6-24.2 months; 16.5 months, 95 % CI, 14.6-18.5 months). After adjusting for age; gender; leukocyte count; hemoglobin level; platelet levels; French, American, and British classification; lactate dehydrogenase levels; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status; nucleophosmin gene; and fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 gene, the multivariate survival analysis showed that the TTT haplotype appeared to be a predicting factor for OS (p = 0.001, hazard ratio = 1.854, 95 % CI, 1.301-2.641) and RFS (p = 0.009, hazard ratio = 1.755, 95 % CI, 1.153-2.671). Moreover, a significant association between the TTT haplotype and relapse in AML patients was observed in this study (p = 0.002, odds ratio = 0.410, 95 % CI, 0.235-0.715). Gene expression level was significantly lower in patients with the TTT haplotype than in the patients with the other haplotypes (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested the TTT haplotype was possibly related to the OS, RFS, and relapse in Chinese patients with AML.","['He, Hui', 'Yin, Jiye', 'Li, Xi', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Xu, Xiaojing', 'Zhai, Ming', 'Chen, Juan', 'Qian, Chenyue', 'Zhou, Honghao', 'Liu, Zhaoqian']","['He H', 'Yin J', 'Li X', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu X', 'Zhai M', 'Chen J', 'Qian C', 'Zhou H', 'Liu Z']","[""Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410008, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150109,Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthracyclines/*therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Asians/*genetics', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2015/01/09 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2015/01/09 06:00'],"['2014/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00228-014-1795-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2015 Mar;71(3):293-302. doi: 10.1007/s00228-014-1795-6.

From gene expression profiling data of 130 Japanese pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, we found that EVI1 and MEL1 were overexpressed in ~30% of patients without obvious translocations of these gene loci, and that their high expression was significantly associated with inferior survival. High EVI1 expression was detected mainly in myelomonocytic-lineage (designated as e-M4/M5 subtype) leukemia with MLL rearrangements and in megakaryocytic-lineage (designated as e-M7 subtype) leukemia, and its prognostic association was observed in the e-M4/M5 subtype but not in the e-M7 subtype. On the other hand, high MEL1 expression was detected in myelocytic-lineage (designated as e-M0/M1/M2 subtype) and e-M4/M5 subtype leukemia without MLL rearrangements, and its prognostic association was independent from the subtypes. Because of their subtype-dependent and mutually exclusive expression, a combined evaluation of their high expression enabled a clear distinction of patients with inferior survival (P<0.00001 in event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS)). This association was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis of an independent cohort of 81 patients (P=0.00017 in EFS, P=0.00028 in OS). We propose that the combined estimation of EVI1 and MEL1 expression will be an effective method to predict the prognosis of pediatric AML.","['Jo, A', 'Mitani, S', 'Shiba, N', 'Hayashi, Y', 'Hara, Y', 'Takahashi, H', 'Tsukimoto, I', 'Tawa, A', 'Horibe, K', 'Tomizawa, D', 'Taga, T', 'Adachi, S', 'Yoshida, T', 'Ichikawa, H']","['Jo A', 'Mitani S', 'Shiba N', 'Hayashi Y', 'Hara Y', 'Takahashi H', 'Tsukimoto I', 'Tawa A', 'Horibe K', 'Tomizawa D', 'Taga T', 'Adachi S', 'Yoshida T', 'Ichikawa H']","['Division of Genetics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Genetics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', ""1] Department of Hematology/Oncology, Gunma Children's Medical Center, Shibukawa, Japan [2] Department of Pediatrics, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Gunma Children's Medical Center, Shibukawa, Japan."", ""1] Department of Hematology/Oncology, Gunma Children's Medical Center, Shibukawa, Japan [2] Department of Pediatrics, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan."", 'Graduate School of Horticulture, Chiba University, Matsudo, Japan.', 'Department of First Pediatrics, Toho University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Hospital Organization Osaka National Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Japan.', 'Human Health Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Genetics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', '1] Division of Genetics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan [2] Department of Clinical Genomics, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan [3] Division of Translational Research, Exploratory Oncology Research and Clinical Trial Center, National Cancer Center, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150108,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromosomes/ultrastructure', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2015/01/09 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2015/01/09 06:00'],"['2014/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['leu20155 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 May;29(5):1076-83. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.5.

The exact role of methylation in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. However, aberrations (e.g. loss-/gain-of-function or up-/down-regulation) in components of epigenetic transcriptional regulation in general, and of the methylation machinery in particular, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In addition, many of these components have been identified as therapeutic targets for patients with MDS/AML, and are also being assessed as potential biomarkers of response or resistance to hypomethylating agents (HMAs). The HMAs 5-azacitidine (AZA) and 2'-deoxy-5-azacitidine (decitabine, DAC) inhibit DNA methylation and have shown significant clinical benefits in patients with myeloid malignancies. Despite being viewed as mechanistically similar drugs, AZA and DAC have differing mechanisms of action. DAC is incorporated 100% into DNA, whereas AZA is incorporated into RNA (80-90%) as well as DNA (10-20%). As such, both drugs inhibit DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs; dependently or independently of DNA replication) resulting in the re-expression of tumor-suppressor genes; however, AZA also has an impact on mRNA and protein metabolism via its inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, resulting in apoptosis. Herein, we first give an overview of transcriptional regulation, including DNA methylation, post-translational histone-tail modifications, the role of micro-RNA and long-range epigenetic gene silencing. We place special emphasis on epigenetic transcriptional regulation and discuss the implication of various components in the pathogenesis of MDS/AML, their potential as therapeutic targets, and their therapeutic modulation by HMAs and other substances (if known). The main focus of this review is laid on dissecting the rapidly evolving knowledge of AZA and DAC with a special focus on their differing mechanisms of action, and the effect of HMAs on transcriptional regulation.","['Pleyer, Lisa', 'Greil, Richard']","['Pleyer L', 'Greil R']","['3rd Medical Department with Hematology and Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University Hospital Salzburg, Center for Clinical Cancer and Immunology Trials at Salzburg Cancer Research Institute , Salzburg , Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150108,England,Drug Metab Rev,Drug metabolism reviews,0322067,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Histone Code', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/etiology/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/etiology/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC4733942,,2015/01/09 06:00,2016/03/19 06:00,['2015/01/09 06:00'],"['2015/01/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/03602532.2014.995379 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Metab Rev. 2015 May;47(2):252-79. doi: 10.3109/03602532.2014.995379.

These patients have a high incidence of malignant transformation. No familial case is known and the etiopathogenic cause remains unknown. In enchondromatosis (Ollier disease, OD), which is comprised of enchondromas only, 4 mutations in the PTHR1 gene have been identified in 4 patients; 3 were somatic and 1 was germline. No PTHR1 mutations have been detected in MS, whereas somatic IDH1 and, more rarely, IDH2 mutations have been observed in 77% of patients with MS and 81% of patients with OD. These genetic alterations are shared with other tumors, including glioma, leukemia and carcinoma. To search for underlying somatic genomic causes, we screened MS tissues using Affymetrix SNP-chips. We looked for CNVs, LOH and uniparental isodisomy (UPID) by performing pairwise analyses between allelic intensities in tumoral DNA versus the corresponding blood-extracted DNA. While common chromosomal anomalies were absent in constitutional DNA, several shared CNVs were identified in MS-associated tumors. The most frequently encountered somatic alterations were localized in 2p22.3, 2q24.3 and 14q11.2, implicating these chromosomal rearrangements in the formation of enchondromas and spindle cell hemangiomas in MS. In one chondrosarcoma specimen, large amplifications and/or deletions were observed in chromosomes 3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 19. Some of these genetic changes have been reported in other chondrosarcomas suggesting an etiopathogenic role. No LOH/UPID was observed in any Maffucci tissue. Our findings identify frequent somatic chromosomal rearrangements on 2p22.3, 2q24.3 and 14q11.2, which may unmask mutations leading to the lesions pathognomonic of MS.","['Amyere, Mustapha', 'Dompmartin, Anne', 'Wouters, Vinciane', 'Enjolras, Odile', 'Kaitila, Ilkka', 'Docquier, Pierre-Louis', 'Godfraind, Catherine', 'Mulliken, John Butler', 'Boon, Laurence Myriam', 'Vikkula, Miikka']","['Amyere M', 'Dompmartin A', 'Wouters V', 'Enjolras O', 'Kaitila I', 'Docquier PL', 'Godfraind C', 'Mulliken JB', 'Boon LM', 'Vikkula M']","['Laboratory of Human Molecular Genetics, de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Dermatology, Universite de Caen Basse Normandie, CHU Caen, Caen, France.', 'Laboratory of Human Molecular Genetics, de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Consultation des Angiomes, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Division of Orthopedic Surgery, Division of Plastic Surgery, Cliniques Universitaires St-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, Division of Plastic Surgery, Cliniques Universitaires St-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.', ""Department of Plastic and Oral Surgery, Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass., USA."", 'Laboratory of Human Molecular Genetics, de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium ; Center for Vascular Anomalies, Division of Plastic Surgery, Cliniques Universitaires St-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Human Molecular Genetics, de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium ; Walloon Excellence in Lifesciences and Biotechnology (WELBIO), Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],['P01 AR048564/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20140826,Switzerland,Mol Syndromol,Molecular syndromology,101525192,,,PMC4281579,,2015/01/08 06:00,2015/01/08 06:01,['2015/01/08 06:00'],"['2014/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000365898 [doi]', 'msy-0005-0259 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Syndromol. 2014 Dec;5(6):259-67. doi: 10.1159/000365898.

In this study, we aimed to explore the efficacy and mechanism of As4S4 in gastric cancer. METHODS: The effect of As4S4 on cell proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells was investigated by MTT assay, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, and annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining using gastric cancer cell lines AGS (harboring wild-type p53) and MGC803 (harboring mutant p53) in vitro. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins was measured by Western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry analysis. Mouse xenograft models were established by inoculation with MGC803 cells, and the morphology and the proportion of apoptotic cells in tumor tissues were detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, respectively. RESULTS: As4S4 inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis of AGS and MGC803 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. As4S4 upregulated the expression of Bax and MDM2 while downregulated the expression of Bcl-2. The expression of p53 increased significantly in the AGS cells but did not readily increase in the MGC803 cells, which harbored mutant p53. Pifithrin-alpha, a p53 inhibitor, blocked the modulation of As4S4 on AGS cells, but not on MGC803 cells. Using xenograft as a model, we showed that As4S4 suppressed tumor growth and induced apoptosis in vivo and that the expression of p53 increased accordingly. CONCLUSION: As4S4 is a potent cytotoxic agent for gastric cancer cells, as it induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo through a p53-dependent pathway. Our data indicate that As4S4 may have therapeutic potential in gastric cancer.","['Zhang, Lian', 'Tian, Wei', 'Kim, Sungkyoung', 'Ding, Wenping', 'Tong, Yingying', 'Chen, Siyu']","['Zhang L', 'Tian W', 'Kim S', 'Ding W', 'Tong Y', 'Chen S']","[""Department of Oncology, Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China ; Department of Oncology, Central Hospital of Zibo, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Xin Hua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141216,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenicals/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4274045,,2015/01/08 06:00,2016/03/10 06:00,['2015/01/08 06:00'],"['2015/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S74379 [doi]', 'dddt-9-079 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2014 Dec 16;9:79-92. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S74379. eCollection 2015.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Sulfides)', '44SIJ800OX (arsenic trisulfide)']",['NOTNLM'],"['As4S4', 'antitumor', 'p53', 'realgar', 'xenograft']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in response to treatment, it is not really known how cells can survive senescence and how irreversible this pathway is. In this study, we analyzed cell escape in response to irinotecan, a first line treatment used in colorectal cancer that induced senescence. We detected subpopulations of cells that adapted to chemotherapy and resumed proliferation. Survival led to the emergence of more transformed cells that induced tumor formation in mice and grew in low adhesion conditions. A significant amount of viable polyploid cells was also generated following irinotecan failure. Markers such as lgr5, CD44, CD133 and ALDH were downregulated in persistent clones, indicating that survival was not associated with an increase in cancer initiating cells. Importantly, malignant cells which resisted senescence relied on survival pathways induced by Mcl-1 signaling and to a lesser extent by Bcl-xL. Depletion of Mcl-1 increased irinotecan efficiency, induced the death of polyploid cells, prevented cell emergence and inhibited growth in low-adhesion conditions. We therefore propose that Mcl-1 targeting should be considered in the future to reduce senescence escape and to improve the treatment of irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancers.","['Jonchere, Barbara', 'Vetillard, Alexandra', 'Toutain, Bertrand', 'Lam, David', 'Bernard, Anne Charlotte', 'Henry, Cecile', 'De Carne Trecesson, Sophie', 'Gamelin, Erick', 'Juin, Philippe', 'Guette, Catherine', 'Coqueret, Olivier']","['Jonchere B', 'Vetillard A', 'Toutain B', 'Lam D', 'Bernard AC', 'Henry C', 'De Carne Trecesson S', 'Gamelin E', 'Juin P', 'Guette C', 'Coqueret O']","['Paul Papin ICO Cancer Center, INSERM U892, CNRS 6299, Angers University, Angers, France.', 'Paul Papin ICO Cancer Center, INSERM U892, CNRS 6299, Angers University, Angers, France.', 'Paul Papin ICO Cancer Center, INSERM U892, CNRS 6299, Angers University, Angers, France.', 'Paul Papin ICO Cancer Center, INSERM U892, CNRS 6299, Angers University, Angers, France.', 'Paul Papin ICO Cancer Center, INSERM U892, CNRS 6299, Angers University, Angers, France.', 'Paul Papin ICO Cancer Center, INSERM U892, CNRS 6299, Angers University, Angers, France.', 'INSERM U892, CNRS 6299, Nantes University, Nantes, France.', 'Paul Papin ICO Cancer Center, INSERM U892, CNRS 6299, Angers University, Angers, France.', 'INSERM U892, CNRS 6299, Nantes University, Nantes, France.

Here we report translocations targeting the zinc finger E-box-binding transcription factor ZEB2 as a recurrent genetic lesion in immature/ETP-ALL. Using a conditional gain-of-function mouse model, we demonstrate that sustained Zeb2 expression initiates T-cell leukaemia. Moreover, Zeb2-driven mouse leukaemia exhibit some features of the human immature/ETP-ALL gene expression signature, as well as an enhanced leukaemia-initiation potential and activated Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signalling through transcriptional activation of IL7R. This study reveals ZEB2 as an oncogene in the biology of immature/ETP-ALL and paves the way towards pre-clinical studies of novel compounds for the treatment of this aggressive subtype of human T-ALL

To reveal the molecular basis of the strain-dependent function of LIF, we compared the activation of the intracellular signaling pathways downstream of LIF in ESCs with different genetic backgrounds. We found that the JAK-Stat3 pathway was dominantly activated in ESCs derived from 'permissive' mouse strains (129Sv and C57BL6), whereas the MAP kinase pathway was hyperactivated in ESCs from 'non-permissive' strains (NOD, CBA and FVB). Artificial activation of Stat3 supported stable self-renewal of ESCs from non-permissive strains.

We discovered that Scl binds to hematopoietic and cardiac enhancers that become epigenetically primed in multipotent cardiovascular mesoderm, to regulate the divergence of hematopoietic and cardiac lineages. Scl does not act as a pioneer factor but rather exploits a pre-established epigenetic landscape. As the blood lineage emerges, Scl binding and active epigenetic modifications are sustained in hematopoietic enhancers, whereas cardiac enhancers are decommissioned by removal of active epigenetic marks. Our data suggest that, rather than recruiting corepressors to enhancers, Scl prevents ectopic cardiogenesis by occupying enhancers that cardiac factors, such as Gata4 and Hand1, use for gene activation. Although hematopoietic Gata factors bind with Scl to both activated and repressed genes, they are dispensable for cardiac repression, but necessary for activating genes that enable hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell development. These results suggest that a unique subset of enhancers in lineage-specific genes that are accessible for regulators of opposing fates during the time of the fate decision provide a platform where the divergence of mutually exclusive fates is orchestrated.","['Org, Tonis', 'Duan, Dan', 'Ferrari, Roberto', 'Montel-Hagen, Amelie', 'Van Handel, Ben', 'Kerenyi, Marc A', 'Sasidharan, Rajkumar', 'Rubbi, Liudmilla', 'Fujiwara, Yuko', 'Pellegrini, Matteo', 'Orkin, Stuart H', 'Kurdistani, Siavash K', 'Mikkola, Hanna Ka']","['Org T', 'Duan D', 'Ferrari R', 'Montel-Hagen A', 'Van Handel B', 'Kerenyi MA', 'Sasidharan R', 'Rubbi L', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Pellegrini M', 'Orkin SH', 'Kurdistani SK', 'Mikkola HK']","['Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA Eli and Edythe Broad Stem Cell Research Center, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Harvard Stem Cell Institute Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Harvard Stem Cell Institute Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Harvard Stem Cell Institute Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Biological Chemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA Eli and Edythe Broad Stem Cell Research Center, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA Eli and Edythe Broad Stem Cell Research Center, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA hmikkola@mcdb.ucla.edu.']",['eng'],"['T32 HL69766/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL032259/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK049216/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL069766/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30DK049216/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150106,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'Gene Library', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mesoderm/*embryology/metabolism', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myoblasts, Cardiac/*cytology/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",PMC4369313,,2015/01/08 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2015/01/08 06:00'],"['2015/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['embj.201490542 [pii]', '10.15252/embj.201490542 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2015 Mar 12;34(6):759-77. doi: 10.15252/embj.201490542.

The disease is believed to be driven by B-cell receptor (BCR) signals generated by external antigens and/or cell-autonomous BCR interactions, but direct in vivo evidence for this is still lacking. To further define the role of the BCR pathway in the development and progression of CLL, we evaluated the capacity of different types of antigen/BCR interactions to induce leukemia in the Emu-TCL1 transgenic mouse model. We show that cell autonomous signaling capacity is a uniform characteristic of the leukemia-derived BCRs and represents a prerequisite for CLL development. Low-affinity BCR interactions with autoantigens generated during apoptosis are also positively selected, suggesting that they contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. In contrast, high-affinity BCR interactions are not selected, regardless of antigen form or presentation. We also show that the capacity of the leukemic cells to respond to cognate antigen correlates inversely with time to leukemia development, suggesting that signals induced by external antigen increase the aggressiveness of the disease. Collectively, these findings provide in vivo evidence that the BCR pathway drives the development and can influence the clinical course of CLL.","['Iacovelli, Stefano', 'Hug, Eva', 'Bennardo, Sara', 'Duehren-von Minden, Marcus', 'Gobessi, Stefania', 'Rinaldi, Andrea', 'Suljagic, Mirza', 'Bilbao, Daniel', 'Bolasco, Giulia', 'Eckl-Dorna, Julia', 'Niederberger, Verena', 'Autore, Francesco', 'Sica, Simona', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Wang, Hongsheng', 'Cornall, Richard J', 'Clarke, Stephen H', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Bertoni, Francesco', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Efremov, Dimitar G']","['Iacovelli S', 'Hug E', 'Bennardo S', 'Duehren-von Minden M', 'Gobessi S', 'Rinaldi A', 'Suljagic M', 'Bilbao D', 'Bolasco G', 'Eckl-Dorna J', 'Niederberger V', 'Autore F', 'Sica S', 'Laurenti L', 'Wang H', 'Cornall RJ', 'Clarke SH', 'Croce CM', 'Bertoni F', 'Jumaa H', 'Efremov DG']","['Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Rome, Italy;', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Freiburg, Germany;', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Rome, Italy;', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Freiburg, Germany;', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Rome, Italy;', 'Lymphoma and Genomics Research Program, IOR Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland;', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Rome, Italy;', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Rome, Italy;', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Rome, Italy;', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria;', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria;', 'Department of Hematology, Catholic University Hospital ""A.

Approximately 90% of patients carry either somatic or germline mutations of PTPN-11, K-RAS, N-RAS, CBL, or NF1 in their leukemic cells. These genetic aberrations are largely mutually exclusive and activate the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the therapy of choice for most patients with JMML, curing more than 50% of affected children. We recommend that this option be promptly offered to any child with PTPN-11-, K-RAS-, or NF1-mutated JMML and to the majority of those with N-RAS mutations. Because children with CBL mutations and few of those with N-RAS mutations may have spontaneous resolution of hematologic abnormalities, the decision to proceed to transplantation in these patients must be weighed carefully. Disease recurrence remains the main cause of treatment failure after HSCT. A second allograft is recommended if overt JMML relapse occurs after transplantation. Recently, azacytidine, a hypomethylating agent, was reported to induce hematologic/molecular remissions in some children with JMML, and its role in both reducing leukemia burden before HSCT and in nontransplant settings requires further studies.","['Locatelli, Franco', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M']","['Locatelli F', 'Niemeyer CM']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy; Department of Pediatrics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy;"", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany; and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150106,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Genetic Testing', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2015/01/08 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2015/01/08 06:00'],"['2015/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)35269-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-08-550483 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Feb 12;125(7):1083-90. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-08-550483.

Most of those factors belong to the already established Nine amino acid Transactivation Domain (9aaTAD) family. By using available structural data, we found binding analogy for the 9aaTAD in the MLL-KIX and also E2A/HEB-KIX complexes. We recognized two distinct TAD formations in the KIX complex. In the E2A/HEB-KIX complex, the leucine position is determined by the prolonged helical structure including the 9aaTAD and the leucine (long-helical TAD). However in the MLL-KIX complex, the equal position of 9aaTAD and proximal leucine is achieved differently by leucine-turn-helix structural architecture. Furthermore, the FOXO3-KIX complex shares structural analogy with the E2A-KIX complex in respect of both 9aaTAD and proximal leucine. Next, from (i) sequence alignment of the identified 9aaTADs in p53, E2A/HEB and MLL proteins and (ii) the resolved structure of the MLL-KIX and E2A/HEB-KIX complexes, we generated a plausible structural model for p53 that could be used also for other members of the 9aaTAD family. The position of 9aaTADs in Oaf1-, Pdr1- and Gcn4-MED15 KIX complexes and 9aaTAD composition are in good agreement with E2A, MLL, FOXO3 and p53. Analyses of structural data in this study define fundamental structural requirements and shed more light on the ambiguous 9aaTAD domain.","['Piskacek, Martin', 'Vasku, Anna', 'Hajek, Roman', 'Knight, Andrea']","['Piskacek M', 'Vasku A', 'Hajek R', 'Knight A']","['Department of Pathological Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic.

Imaging evidence of toxicity is often asymptomatic, but can be clinically consequential. A young patient, treated for cerebrospinal fluid relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with methotrexate and cytarabine via Ommaya reservoir, presented with acute deterioration of short-term memory. MRI demonstrated extra-ventricular Ommaya catheter position and typical methotrexate-induced changes in the deep white matter, but also signal alteration in the forniceal columns and mammillary bodies, components of the Papez circuit. This case presents a novel mechanism of chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity associated with extra-ventricular Ommaya catheter position. Specifically, the clinical and imaging findings suggest that extra-ventricular Ommaya catheter position may lead to a direct methotrexate-induced toxicity to the Papez circuit. This provides further clinical evidence of the function of the circuit. The possibility that this patient received a supratherapeutic dose of methotrexate may explain why this presentation with profound memory impairment is not more common. However, this case also provides a potential explanation for patients who receive standard dose chemotherapy via extra-ventricular Ommaya catheter and develop milder memory loss.","['Kwan, Benjamin Yin Ming', 'Krings, Timo', 'Bernstein, Mark', 'Mandell, Daniel M']","['Kwan BY', 'Krings T', 'Bernstein M', 'Mandell DM']","['Division of Neuroradiology, Toronto Western Hospital and the University of Toronto, 399 Bathurst Street 3 MCL-426, Toronto, Ontario M5T2S8, Canada; Department of Medical Imaging, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Neuroradiology, Toronto Western Hospital and the University of Toronto, 399 Bathurst Street 3 MCL-426, Toronto, Ontario M5T2S8, Canada.', 'Division of Neurosurgery, Toronto Western Hospital and the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Neuroradiology, Toronto Western Hospital and the University of Toronto, 399 Bathurst Street 3 MCL-426, Toronto, Ontario M5T2S8, Canada.

Our aim was to better characterize the clinicopathologic and molecular relationships in a cohort of GIST patients. METHODS: All GIST patients with tumor samples sent for molecular testing were identified via electronic medical records. Clinicopathologic characteristics of GIST and additional primary malignancies were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 260 patients, 50 (19 %) had at least one additional primary malignancy. In 33 patients, separate primary neoplasms predated their GIST diagnosis and most commonly included: prostate (n = 9), breast (n = 8), and hematologic (n = 5). Renal (n = 4) and hematologic (n = 3) malignancies were the most frequent cancers identified after GIST diagnosis. The majority (8 of 12, 66 %) of malignancies diagnosed after GIST were found incidentally. Patients who developed other malignancies after GIST more often had KIT exon 11 mutations (100 vs. 66 %, P = 0.01). In comparison to patients with only GIST, patients with a second primary neoplasm of any chronology had GISTs with increased mitotic rate (>/=5 per 50 high-power fields) (P = 0.0006). Literature review revealed colorectal cancer, gastric, prostate, renal, leukemia, and desmoid-type fibromatosis as the most common secondary neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS: Nineteen percent of GIST patients develop other malignancies. This is the first report to describe a relationship between additional primary malignancy and both mutation and mitotic rate of GIST. Although the basis of these relationships remains to be investigated, caution in the clinical management of GIST patients with additional lesions is warranted.","['Hechtman, Jaclyn Frances', 'DeMatteo, Ronald', 'Nafa, Khedoudja', 'Chi, Ping', 'Arcila, Maria E', 'Dogan, Snjezana', 'Oultache, Alifya', 'Chen, Wen', 'Hameed, Meera']","['Hechtman JF', 'DeMatteo R', 'Nafa K', 'Chi P', 'Arcila ME', 'Dogan S', 'Oultache A', 'Chen W', 'Hameed M']","['Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA, hechtmaj@mskcc.org.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150107,United States,Ann Surg Oncol,Annals of surgical oncology,9420840,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'INDEL Mutation', 'Incidence', 'Incidental Findings', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitotic Index', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/genetics/therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC4508237,['NIHMS686795'],2015/01/08 06:00,2016/05/18 06:00,['2015/01/08 06:00'],"['2014/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1245/s10434-014-4332-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Surg Oncol. 2015 Aug;22(8):2633-9. doi: 10.1245/s10434-014-4332-z.

METHODS: Western blot was used to detect the effects of RIG-G protein overexpression on p21 protein expression level in leukemia cell line NB4 cells and the phosphorylation of both c-Jun and JNK in U937 cells. The c-Jun expression plasmid and p21 gene promoter-containing reporter plasmid were co-transfected into 293T cells, to explore the regulatory effect of c-Jun protein on p21 gene expression by luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: Western blot showed that the overexpression of RIG-G protein significantly upregulated p21 protein level in the NB4 cells, and the level of p21 protein largely increased along with the induction of endogenous RIG-G protein during the differentiation of NB4 cells treated by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Moreover, the phosphorylation of both c-Jun and JNK decreased in RIG-G-overexpressing U937 cells while total c-Jun and JNK proteins remained unchanged. After using the JNK inhibitor SP600125 to block JNK phosphorylation, the level of c-Jun phosphorylation was still dramatically reduced in the RIG-G-overexpressing U937T-RIG-G cells, compared with the control U937T-pTRE cells. These results indicated that the inhibitory effect of Rig-G protein on c-Jun phosphorylation could not only be through the JNK pathway, but also via some JNK-independent pathways. Luciferase reporter assay showed that when 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 microg c-Jun-expressing plasmids were respectively transfected into 293T cells, compared with the empty vector-transfected group, the relative luciferase activities were (83.0 +/- 1.7)%, (73.7 +/- 0.7)%, (68.9 +/- 0.9)% and (64.1 +/- 0.9)%, indicating that the transcriptional activity of p21 gene could be inhibited by c-Jun protein. CONCLUSIONS: RIG-G protein may suppress the phosphorylation of c-Jun protein through different signal pathways, thereby increasing the expression of p21 gene, arresting the cell cycle and inhibiting the cell growth in U937 cells.","['Zou, Qingping', 'Xu, Guiping', 'Zhuang, Likun', 'Zhang, Zhanglin', 'Yan, Weiwei', 'Zhang, Yingting', 'Lou, Yejiang', 'Tong, Jianhua']","['Zou Q', 'Xu G', 'Zhuang L', 'Zhang Z', 'Yan W', 'Zhang Y', 'Lou Y', 'Tong J']","['Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Faculty of Medical Laboratory Science, State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.

Using human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines as a model, we present evidence that SKI-178 induces prolonged mitosis followed by apoptotic cell death through the intrinsic apoptotic cascade. Further examination of the mechanism of action of SKI-178 implicated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and cyclin-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDK1) as critical factors required for SKI-178-induced apoptosis. In cell cycle synchronized human AML cell lines, we demonstrate that entry into mitosis is required for apoptotic induction by SKI-178 and that CDK1, not JNK, is required for SKI-178-induced apoptosis. We further demonstrate that the sustained activation of CDK1 during prolonged mitosis, mediated by SKI-178, leads to the simultaneous phosphorylation of the prosurvival Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, as well as the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of Mcl-1. Moreover, multidrug resistance mediated by multidrug-resistant protein1 and/or prosurvival Bcl-2 family member overexpression did not affect the sensitivity of AML cells to SKI-178.

One of the most studied microfilament-directed agents has been cytochalasin B, a mycogenic toxin known to disrupt the formation of actin polymers. Therefore, this study sought to expand on our previous work with the microfilament-directed agent, along with other less studied cytochalasin congeners. Materials and Methods We determined whether cytochalasin B exerted significant cytotoxic effects in vitro on adherent M109 lung carcinoma and B16BL6 and B16F10 murine melanomas, or on suspension P388/ADR murine leukemia cells. We also examined whether cytochalasin B, its reduced congener 21, 22-dihydrocytochalasin B (DiHCB), or cytochalasin D could synergize with doxorubicin (ADR) against ADR-resistant P388/ADR leukemia cells, and produce significant cytotoxicity in vitro. For in vivo characterization, cytochalasins B and D were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to Balb/c mice challenged with drug sensitive P388-S or multidrug resistant P388/ADR leukemias. Results Cytochalasin B demonstrated higher cytotoxicity against adherent lung carcinoma and melanoma cells than against suspension P388/ADR leukemia cells, as assessed by comparative effects on cell growth, and IC(5)(0) and IC(8)(0) values. Isobolographic analysis indicated that both cytochalasin B and DiHCB demonstrate considerable drug synergy with ADR against ADR-resistant P388/ADR leukemia, while cytochalasin D exhibits only additivity with ADR against the same cell line. In vivo, cytochalasins B and D substantially increased the life expectancy of mice challenged with P388/S and P388/ADR leukemias, and in some cases, produced long-term survival. Conclusion Taken together, it appears that cytochalasins have unique antineoplastic activity that could potentiate a novel class of chemotherapeutic agents.","['Trendowski, Matthew', 'Mitchell, Joan M', 'Corsette, Christine M', 'Acquafondata, Christopher', 'Fondy, Thomas P']","['Trendowski M', 'Mitchell JM', 'Corsette CM', 'Acquafondata C', 'Fondy TP']","['Department of Biology, Syracuse University, 107 College Place, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA, mrtrendo@syr.edu.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150107,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochalasin B/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasin D/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Melanoma/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4387261,,2015/01/08 06:00,2016/01/20 06:00,['2015/01/08 06:00'],"['2014/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-014-0203-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2015 Apr;33(2):290-9. doi: 10.1007/s10637-014-0203-5.

Fifty-three patients were enrolled in the study. The complete remission (CR) rate was 100 %. No patient died during induction therapy. The 9-year event-free survival (EFS) and 9-year overall survival (OS) for all patients were 79.0 and 83.0 %, respectively. Outcome estimates according to the body mass index (BMI) were carried out. Twenty-three (43.4 %) were underweight/normal (BMI < 23.0 kg/m(2)), whereas 30 patients (56.6 %) were overweight/obese (BMI >/= 23.0 kg/m(2)). Underweight/normal-weight patients had a 9-year OS of 100 %, compared with 73.0 % for overweight/obese patients (P = 0.044).

It is also a heterogeneous disease with a variable clinical outcome. Here, we present a review of currently known (epi)genetic alterations that are related to the etiology, progression and chemo-refractoriness of CLL. Relevant literature was identified through a PubMed search (1994-2014) of English-language papers using the terms CLL, signaling pathway, cytogenetic abnormality, somatic mutation, epigenetic alteration and micro-RNA. RESULTS: CLL is characterized by the presence of gross chromosomal abnormalities, epigenetic alterations, micro-RNA expression alterations, immunoglobulin heavy chain gene mutations and other genetic lesions. The expression of unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) genes, ZAP-70 and CD38 proteins, the occurrence of chromosomal abnormalities such as 17p and 11q deletions and mutations of the NOTCH1, SF3B1 and BIRC3 genes have been associated with a poor prognosis. In addition, mutations in tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53 and ATM, have been associated with refractoriness to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Micro-RNA expression alterations and aberrant methylation patterns in genes that are specifically deregulated in CLL, including the BCL-2, TCL1 and ZAP-70 genes, have also been encountered and linked to distinct clinical parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Specific chromosomal abnormalities and gene mutations may serve as diagnostic and prognostic indicators for disease progression and survival. The identification of these anomalies by state-of-the-art molecular (cyto)genetic techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray-based genomic profiling and next-generation sequencing (NGS) can be of paramount help for the clinical management of these patients, including optimal treatment design. The efficacy of novel therapeutics should to be tested according to the presence of these molecular lesions in CLL patients.","['Shahjahani, Mohammad', 'Mohammadiasl, Javad', 'Noroozi, Fatemeh', 'Seghatoleslami, Mohammad', 'Shahrabi, Saeid', 'Saba, Fakhredin', 'Saki, Najmaldin']","['Shahjahani M', 'Mohammadiasl J', 'Noroozi F', 'Seghatoleslami M', 'Shahrabi S', 'Saba F', 'Saki N']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150107,Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis']",,,2015/01/08 06:00,2016/02/05 06:00,['2015/01/08 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13402-014-0215-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Oncol (Dordr). 2015 Apr;38(2):93-109. doi: 10.1007/s13402-014-0215-3.

The identification of BRAFV600E mutations and the role of aberrant MEK kinase and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) pathways in the pathogenesis of HCL have helped to develop novel targeted therapies for these patients. Currently, the most promising therapeutic strategies for relapsed or refractory HCL include recombinant immunoconjugates targeting CD22 (e.g. moxetumomab pasudotox), BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib and B cell receptor signaling kinase inhibitors such as ibrutinib. Furthermore, the VH4-34 molecular variant of classic HCL has been identified to be less responsive to chemotherapy.

A total of 256 (68%) were treated with standard ""7+3"" induction and high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone containing ""4+3"" consolidation/intensification regimens. Our study focused on patients with presumably very poor prognosis - patients, who did not achieve complete cytogenetic remission (CRc). Twenty-five AML patients without CRc were further analysed for clinical and laboratory parameters. Firstly, the subgroups with or without morphologic CR were compared. Similar cytogenetic abnormalities were observed in both with myelodysplasia related changes being the most common. Complex karyotype with deletion of 5q constituted approximately a third of all karyotypes in both subgroups. There were 1 patient with intermediate risk cytogenetics in the subgroup without morphologic CR and 5 patients in the subgroup with morphologic CR. Interestingly, in 4/25 patients subclones were diminished by the chemotherapy treatment, however cytogenetically less advanced clones proliferated. Secondly, transplanted or nontransplanted patients were analysed. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) was found to be the only curative treatment for patients without CRc after 7+3 and 4+3 regimens. In our cohort, 40% of the patients, who underwent allo-SCT, are alive. Importantly, 67% of the patients, who died after allo-SCT, died of causes unrelated to progression of AML. Nonrelapse mortality is therefore one of the fields where survival could be further improved.

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed with information from STRING and significant KEGG pathways were unveiled. Protein complexes were predicted using ClusterONE from Cytoscape and then validated in terms of pathways, protein domain, cellular localization and literatures. A total of 1712 genes (1911 probes) were found to be differentially expressed in prolactinoma. Interactions were identified among 121 protein products. Nineteen significant pathways (FDR< 0.05) were acquired and pathways in cancer was the top one. Pathways linked to myeloid leukemia and tryptophan metabolism were also enriched in the DEGs. Four protein complexes were predicted and then validated. They were associated with focal adhesion, cytoskeleton, metabolism of tryptophan, arginine and proline as well as aldehyde dehydrogenases. They might play important roles in the pathogenesis of prolactinoma. In present study, not only DEGs were provided, but also PPIs and protein complexes were discussed.

NT/T-AML is categorised as complex cytogenetics and therefore, presumed to have an unfavourable prognosis. Our aim is to further characterise the clinical, morphological, cytogenetic and prognostic features of NT/T-AML. METHODS: We searched our cytogenetic laboratory database from 1991 to 2012 to reveal 13 cases of NT/T-AML. Each case was evaluated with regard to its demographics, morphology, immunophenotype and prognosis. Specific morphological features included blast size, irregularity of nuclear contours, cytoplasmic vacuoles, and presence and lineage of dysplasia. RESULTS: Eleven men and two women had a median age of 68 years. Blasts were predominately large (11/13). Eight of 13 patients had AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. Sixty-nine per cent of patients achieved complete remission (CR). Median overall survival (OS) was 8.6 months. CR rate and median OS in cases with >/= 5 cytogenetic abnormalities were 71% and 6 months, compared with 67% and 18.1 months in cases with <5 abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: NT/T-AML occurs in older males, exhibits large blast size and is associated with myelodysplasia. Unlike previously reported data, our study reveals an overall better prognosis in this older population with NT/T-AML than was expected for a complex karyotype AML. Cytogenetic complexity independent of ploidy status did not greatly affect the high CR rates, but did appear to be a better estimation of prognostic risk in terms of median OS.","['Pang, Changlee S', 'Pettenati, Mark J', 'Pardee, Timothy S']","['Pang CS', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Pardee TS']","['Department of Pathology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston Salem, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston Salem, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston Salem, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],['K08 CA169809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20150106,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Cytogenetics', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', '*Tetraploidy', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4886850,['NIHMS787493'],2015/01/08 06:00,2015/05/21 06:00,['2015/01/08 06:00'],"['2015/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['jclinpath-2014-202697 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2014-202697 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2015 Mar;68(3):236-40. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2014-202697.

Here, we evaluated the treatment effects of SS-BM and G-BM/G-PBSC in human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling transplantation. METHODS: A total of 226 patients (acute myelogenous leukemia-complete remission 1, chronic myelogenous leukemia-chronic phase 1) received SS-BM, G-BM, or G-PBSC from an HLA-identical sibling. Clinical outcomes (graft-versus-host disease [GVHD], overall survival, transplant-related mortality [TRM], and leukemia-free survival [LFS]) were analyzed. RESULTS: When compared to SS-BM, G-BM gave faster recovery time to neutrophil or platelet (P < 0.05). Incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was lower than seen with SS-BM (P < 0.05) and similar to G-PBSC. Although the incidence of cGVHD in the G-BM group was similar to SS-BM, both were lower than G-PBSC (P < 0.05). G-BM and G-PBSC exhibited similar survival, LFS, and TRM, but were significantly different from SS-BM (P < 0.05).

METHODS: This secondary data analysis evaluated 12-month survival (12-ms) in 3 987 children diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 with lymphoid leukemia (LL) and myeloid leukemia (ML) and registered in Argentina's population-based oncopediatric registry. Prognostic groups based on age at diagnosis, gender, socioeconomic index of the province of residence, and migration to a different province to receive health care were identified using the RP method. RESULTS: Overall 12-ms for LL and ML cases was 83.7% and 59.9% respectively. RP detected major gaps in 12-ms. Among 1-10-year-old LL patients from poorer provinces, 12-ms for those who did and did not migrate was 87.0% and 78.2% respectively. Survival of ML patients < 2 years old from provinces with a low/medium socioeconomic index was 38.9% compared to 62.1% for those in the same age group from richer provinces. For 2-14-year-old ML patients living in poor provinces, patient migration was associated with a 30% increase in 12-ms. CONCLUSIONS: Major disparities in leukemia survival among Argentine children were found. Patient migration and socioeconomic index of residence province were associated with survival. The RP method was instrumental in identifying and characterizing vulnerable groups.","['Garibotti, Gilda', 'Moreno, Florencia', 'Dussel, Veronica', 'Orellana, Liliana']","['Garibotti G', 'Moreno F', 'Dussel V', 'Orellana L']","['Centro Regional Universitario Bariloche, Universidad Nacional del Comahue, , garibottig@comahue-conicet.gob.ar.', 'Instituto Nacional del Cancer, Argentine Hospital Oncopediatric Registr, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Efectividad Clinica y Sanitaria, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Calculo, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Rev Panam Salud Publica,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,9705400,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Argentina/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', '*Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Sex Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Rate']",,,2015/01/08 06:00,2016/04/01 06:00,['2015/01/08 06:00'],"['2014/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['S1020-49892014000900006 [pii]'],ppublish,Rev Panam Salud Publica. 2014 Oct;36(4):248-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using MOV10 overexpressed in viral producer cells, MOV10 was shown to reduce the infectivity of XMRV. MOV10 could be incorporated into XMRV, suggesting that MOV10 could undergo encapsidation by XMRV during viral assembly. MOV10 could also restrict the DNA production of XMRV in target cells. We found that the putative RNA-helicase domain of MOV10 maintained most of its XMRV inhibition. These results suggest that MOV10 could be required during the retroviral lifecycle. Perturbation of MOV10 disrupts the generation of infectious viral particles, suggesting that MOV10 has broad antiretroviral activity.

Reduction of Fli1 expression in mice has been shown to result in up-regulation of collagen type I alpha 1 (Col1a1) and alpha 2 (Col1a2) genes and, conversely, in down-regulation of the matrix metalloproteinase 1 (Mmp1) gene, suggesting that Fli1 suppression is involved in activation of the profibrotic gene program. Here we examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes as risk factors for cutaneous (CL) and mucosal leishmaniasis (ML), and leishmaniasis per se, caused by L. braziliensis in humans. SNPs were genotyped in 168 nuclear families (250 CL; 87 ML cases) and replicated in 157 families (402 CL; 39 ML cases). Family-based association tests (FBAT) showed the strongest association between SNPs rs1061237 (combined P=0.002) and rs2586488 (combined P=0.027) at COL1A1 and CL disease. This contributes to our further understanding of the role of wound healing in the resolution of CL disease, providing potential for therapies modulating COL1A1 via drugs acting on FLI1.","['Almeida, Lucas', 'Oliveira, Joyce', 'Guimaraes, Luiz Henrique', 'Carvalho, Edgar M', 'Blackwell, Jenefer M', 'Castellucci, Lea']","['Almeida L', 'Oliveira J', 'Guimaraes LH', 'Carvalho EM', 'Blackwell JM', 'Castellucci L']","['National Institute of Science and Technology in Tropical Diseases, Brazil and Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.

Most of the studies have recruited patients with disseminated disease originating from the liver. This study focuses on disease limited to the liver. AIM: To perform a retrospective analysis of all patients with liver tumors treated by robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy in a single center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 13 patients with 22 lesions. The inclusion criteria were: patients with 1-4 inoperable liver lesions and absence of any extrahepatic disease. All but 3 patients received 3 fractions delivered by the Cyberknife system of a total of 45 grey (Gy). The other 3 patients received 30 Gy. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 10.8 months (range: 7-16). The median dose was 41.5 Gy (range: 30-45). One lesion regressed (8%). In 5 patients, the disease was locally stabilized (38%), and in 7 other patients progression occurred (54%). Twelve patients (92%) are still alive, and 1 patient (8%) died. In 1 patient a new cancer (leukemia) was diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: The SBRT is well tolerated and effective for local control of most liver malignant tumors. It appears that SBRT is best suited for those patients in whom systemic recurrence can be controlled by chemotherapy. Further studies are mandatory to elucidate these effects on tumors of varying histology and to elaborate upon criteria used to select patients who can benefit most from this treatment.","['Fraczek, Mariusz', 'Sobocki, Jacek', 'Pedziwiatr, Katarzyna', 'Skrocki, Edward', 'Piotrkowicz, Norbert', 'Tyc-Szczepaniak, Dobromira', 'Korab-Chrzanowska, Elzbieta', 'Hevelke, Piotr', 'Krasnodebski, Maciej', 'Koszewski, Waldemar']","['Fraczek M', 'Sobocki J', 'Pedziwiatr K', 'Skrocki E', 'Piotrkowicz N', 'Tyc-Szczepaniak D', 'Korab-Chrzanowska E', 'Hevelke P', 'Krasnodebski M', 'Koszewski W']","['Department of General, Transplant and Liver Surgery, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of General, Oncology and Gastrointestinal Surgery, St. Anna Memorial Hospital, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Institute of CyberSurgery, Wieliszew, Poland.', 'Institute of CyberSurgery, Wieliszew, Poland.', 'Institute of CyberSurgery, Wieliszew, Poland.', 'Institute of CyberSurgery, Wieliszew, Poland.', 'Institute of CyberSurgery, Wieliszew, Poland.', 'Institute of CyberSurgery, Wieliszew, Poland.', 'Department of General, Transplant and Liver Surgery, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Institute of CyberSurgery, Wieliszew, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140723,Poland,Wideochir Inne Tech Maloinwazyjne,Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,101283175,,,PMC4280411,,2015/01/07 06:00,2015/01/07 06:01,['2015/01/07 06:00'],"['2014/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5114/wiitm.2014.44258 [doi]', '23250 [pii]']",ppublish,Wideochir Inne Tech Maloinwazyjne. 2014 Dec;9(4):511-6. doi: 10.5114/wiitm.2014.44258.

Epidemiological studies, designed to verify whether EMF exposure may be a potential risk factor for health, have led to controversial results. The possible association between EMFs and an increased incidence of childhood leukemia, brain tumors or neurodegenerative diseases was not fully elucidated. On the other hand, EMFs are widely used, in neurology, psychiatry, rheumatology, orthopedics and dermatology, both in diagnosis and in therapy. In vitro studies may help to evaluate the mechanism by which LF-EMFs affect biological systems. In vitro model of wound healing used keratinocytes (HaCaT), neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) as a model for analysis of differentiation, metabolism and functions related to neurodegenerative processes, and monocytic cell line (THP-1) was used as a model for inflammation and cytokines production, while leukemic cell line (K562) was used as a model for hematopoietic differentiation. MCP-1, a chemokine that regulates the migration and infiltration of memory T cells, natural killer (NK), monocytes and epithelial cells, has been demonstrated to be induced and involved in various diseases. Since, varying the parameters of EMFs different effects may be observed, we have studied MCP-1 expression in HaCaT, SH-SY5Y, THP-1 and K562 exposed to a sinusoidal EMF at 50 Hz frequency with a flux density of 1 mT (rms). Our preliminary results showed that EMF-exposure differently modifies the expression of MCP-1 in different cell types. Thus, the MCP-1 expression needs to be better determined, with additional studies, with different parameters and times of exposure to ELF-EMF.","[""D'Angelo, C"", 'Costantini, E', 'Kamal, M A', 'Reale, M']","[""D'Angelo C"", 'Costantini E', 'Kamal MA', 'Reale M']","['Dept.

METHODS: We detected PBX3 expression in five cell lines and surgical specimens from 111 patients with CRC using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We forced expression of PBX3 in low metastatic HT-29 and SW480 cells and knocked down expression of PBX3 in highly metastatic LOVO and HCT-8 cells. Wound healing and Boyden chamber assays were used to detect cell migration and invasion after altered expression of PBX3. Western blot was performed to detect the change of signaling molecule ERK1/2 following PBX3 overexpression. RESULTS: High level of PBX3 expression was correlated with the invasive potential of CRC cells, and significantly associated with lymph node invasion (P = 0.02), distant metastasis (P = 0.04), advanced TNM stage (P = 0.03) and poor overall survival of patients (P < 0.05). Ectopic expression of PBX3 in low metastatic cells was shown to promote migration and invasion, while inhibited PBX3 expression in highly metastatic cells suppressed migration and invasion. Furthermore, upregulation of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 was found to be one of the targeted molecules responsible for PBX3-induced CRC cell migration and invasion. CONCLUSION: PBX3 induces invasion and metastasis of CRC cells partially through activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.","['Han, Hai-Bo', 'Gu, Jin', 'Ji, Deng-Bo', 'Li, Zhao-Wei', 'Zhang, Yuan', 'Zhao, Wei', 'Wang, Li-Min', 'Zhang, Zhi-Qian']","['Han HB', 'Gu J', 'Ji DB', 'Li ZW', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhao W', 'Wang LM', 'Zhang ZQ']","['Hai-Bo Han, Yuan Zhang, Wei Zhao, Li-Min Wang, Zhi-Qian Zhang, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Cell Biology, Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Hai-Bo Han, Yuan Zhang, Wei Zhao, Li-Min Wang, Zhi-Qian Zhang, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Cell Biology, Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Hai-Bo Han, Yuan Zhang, Wei Zhao, Li-Min Wang, Zhi-Qian Zhang, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Cell Biology, Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Hai-Bo Han, Yuan Zhang, Wei Zhao, Li-Min Wang, Zhi-Qian Zhang, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Cell Biology, Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Hai-Bo Han, Yuan Zhang, Wei Zhao, Li-Min Wang, Zhi-Qian Zhang, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Cell Biology, Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Hai-Bo Han, Yuan Zhang, Wei Zhao, Li-Min Wang, Zhi-Qian Zhang, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Cell Biology, Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Hai-Bo Han, Yuan Zhang, Wei Zhao, Li-Min Wang, Zhi-Qian Zhang, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Cell Biology, Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Hai-Bo Han, Yuan Zhang, Wei Zhao, Li-Min Wang, Zhi-Qian Zhang, Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Cell Biology, Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute, Beijing 100142, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,IM,"['*Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'HT29 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",PMC4277963,,2015/01/07 06:00,2015/10/23 06:00,['2015/01/07 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3748/wjg.v20.i48.18260 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2014 Dec 28;20(48):18260-70. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v20.i48.18260.,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cell invasion', 'Cell migration', 'Colorectal cancer', 'Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway', 'Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 3']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL1 is the best characterized human SET1 family member, which includes MLL1-4 and SETd1A/B. MLL1 assembles with WDR5, RBBP5, ASH2L, DPY-30 (WRAD) to form the MLL1 core complex, which is required for H3K4 dimethylation and transcriptional activation. Because all SET1 family proteins interact with WRAD in vivo, it is hypothesized they are regulated by similar mechanisms. However, recent evidence suggests differences among family members that may reflect unique regulatory inputs in the cell. Missing is an understanding of the intrinsic enzymatic activities of different SET1 family complexes under standard conditions. In this investigation, we reconstituted each human SET1 family core complex and compared subunit assembly and enzymatic activities. We found that in the absence of WRAD, all but one SET domain catalyzes at least weak H3K4 monomethylation. In the presence of WRAD, all SET1 family members showed stimulated monomethyltransferase activity but differed in their di- and trimethylation activities. We found that these differences are correlated with evolutionary lineage, suggesting these enzyme complexes have evolved to accomplish unique tasks within metazoan genomes. To understand the structural basis for these differences, we employed a ""phylogenetic scanning mutagenesis"" assay and identified a cluster of amino acid substitutions that confer a WRAD-dependent gain-of-function dimethylation activity on complexes assembled with the MLL3 or Drosophila trithorax proteins. These results form the basis for understanding how WRAD differentially regulates SET1 family complexes in vivo.","['Shinsky, Stephen A', 'Monteith, Kelsey E', 'Viggiano, Susan', 'Cosgrove, Michael S']","['Shinsky SA', 'Monteith KE', 'Viggiano S', 'Cosgrove MS']","['From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State University of New York Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State University of New York Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State University of New York Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210.', 'From the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, State University of New York Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210 cosgrovm@upstate.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA140522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA140522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20150105,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lysine/genetics', 'Methylation', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', '*Phylogeny', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors']",PMC4358272,,2015/01/07 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2015/01/07 06:00'],"['2015/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)46775-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.627646 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Mar 6;290(10):6361-75. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.627646.

Here, we investigated the anti-cancer activity of morin, a flavone originally isolated from members of the Moraceae family in human leukemic cells, focusing on apoptosis. An anti-cancer effect of morin was screened with several human leukemic cell lines. U937 cells were most sensitive to morin, where it induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. It also induced loss of MMP (DeltaPsim) along with cytochrome c release, down-regulated Bcl-2 protein, and up-regulated BAX proteins. The apoptotic activity of morin was significantly attenuated by Bcl-2 augmentation. In conclusion, morin induced caspase-dependent apoptosis through an intrinsic pathway by upregulating BAD proteins. In addition, Bcl-2 protein expression is also important in morin-induced apoptosis of U937 cells.

Our study demonstrated that fascaplysin induced a cooperative interaction between apoptotic and autophagic pathways to induce cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells. Fascaplysin treatment not only activated pro-apoptotic events like PARP-1 cleavage and caspase activation but also triggered autophagy signaling as shown by the increased expression of LC3-II, ATG7and beclin. Interestingly, it was found that use of pan-caspase inhibitor completely reversed the fascaplysin mediated cell death as analyzed by MTT and cell cycle assays. It was observed that cell death as well as the expression of pro-death proteins was partially reversed, when key autophagy mediators ATG7 was silenced by siRNA in fascaplysin treated cells. Cooperative involvement of autophagy and apoptotic signaling in cytotoxicity was confirmed when combined silencing of pro-apototic (PARP-1) and autophagic (ATG-7) signaling by respective siRNA's lead to substantial rescue of cell death induced by fascaplysin. Although, apoptosis and autophagy are two independent cell death pathways, our findings provide detailed insight by which both the pathways acted cooperatively to elicit fascaplysin induced cell death in HL-60 cells. Our findings provide molecular insight into the anti-cancer potential of fascaplysin by showing that both autophagic and apoptotic signaling can work together in the induction of cell death.","['Kumar, Suresh', 'Guru, Santosh Kumar', 'Pathania, Anup Singh', 'Manda, Sudhakar', 'Kumar, Ajay', 'Bharate, Sandip B', 'Vishwakarma, Ram A', 'Malik, Fayaz', 'Bhushan, Shashi']","['Kumar S', 'Guru SK', 'Pathania AS', 'Manda S', 'Kumar A', 'Bharate SB', 'Vishwakarma RA', 'Malik F', 'Bhushan S']","['Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), New Delhi, 110001, India; Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, CSIR, Jammu, 180001, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",,,2015/01/07 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/01/07 06:00'],"['2015/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.25053 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2015 Jun;116(6):985-97. doi: 10.1002/jcb.25053.,"['0 (Indoles)', '114719-57-2 (fascaplysine)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Caspases; Fascaplysin', 'PI3K/AKT pathway']","['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Racial groups studied included NHW (non-Hispanic whites), HW (Hispanic whites), blacks, and API (Asians and Pacific Islanders). Patient characteristics, age-adjusted incidence rate, and survival were compared across races. Stratification and multivariate analysis were conducted. RESULTS: There are significant racial differences for patients' characteristics, including gender, age at diagnosis, stage, lymph site, and age, and the patterns vary across subtypes. NHWs have the highest incidence rates for all three subtypes, followed by HWs (DLBCL and FL) and blacks (CLL/SLL). The dependence of the incidence rate on age and gender varies across subtypes. For all three subtypes, NHWs have the highest five-year relative survival rates, followed by HWs. When stratified by stage, racial difference is significant in multiple multivariate Cox regression analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences exist among DLBCL, FL, and CLL/SLL patients in the U.S. in terms of characteristics, incidence, and survival. The patterns vary across subtypes. More data collection and analysis are needed to more comprehensively describe and interpret the across-race and subtype differences.","['Li, Yang', 'Wang, Yu', 'Wang, Zhuoyue', 'Yi, Danhui', 'Ma, Shuangge']","['Li Y', 'Wang Y', 'Wang Z', 'Yi D', 'Ma S']","['School of Statistics and The Center for Applied Statistics, Renmin University of China, 59 Zhongguancun Ave. Beijing, 100872, China.', 'School of Statistics and The Center for Applied Statistics, Renmin University of China, 59 Zhongguancun Ave. Beijing, 100872, China.', 'School of Statistics and The Center for Applied Statistics, Renmin University of China, 59 Zhongguancun Ave. Beijing, 100872, China.', 'School of Statistics and The Center for Applied Statistics, Renmin University of China, 59 Zhongguancun Ave. Beijing, 100872, China.', 'School of Statistics and The Center for Applied Statistics, Renmin University of China, 59 Zhongguancun Ave. Beijing, 100872, China.', 'School of Public Health, Yale University, 60 College ST, New Haven CT, 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000142/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150102,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/ethnology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*epidemiology/ethnology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*epidemiology/ethnology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Racial Groups/*statistics & numerical data', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4323749,['NIHMS649380'],2015/01/07 06:00,2015/11/04 06:00,['2015/01/07 06:00'],"['2014/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.canep.2014.12.001 [doi]', 'S1877-7821(14)00220-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2015 Feb;39(1):8-13. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2014.12.001.

Genetic association studies over databases offer an attractive starting point for gene discovery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Phenome Genome Integrator (PheGenI) tool was enriched for pancreatic cancer-associated traits. The genes associated with the trait were characterized using diverse bioinformatics tools for Genome-Wide Association (GWA), transcriptome and proteome profile and protein classes for motif and domain. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-six genes were identified that had a genetic association with pancreatic cancer in the human genome. This included 25 uncharacterized open reading frames (ORFs). Bioinformatics analysis of these ORFs identified putative druggable proteins and biomarkers including enzymes, transporters and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling proteins. Secreted proteins including a neuroendocrine factor and a chemokine were identified. Five out of these ORFs encompassed non coding RNAs. The ORF protein expression was detected in numerous body fluids, such as ascites, bile, pancreatic juice, milk, plasma, serum and saliva. Transcriptome and proteome analyses showed a correlation of mRNA and protein expression for nine ORFs. Analysis of the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database revealed a strong correlation across copy number variations and mRNA over-expression for four ORFs. Mining of the International Cancer Gene Consortium (ICGC) database identified somatic mutations in a significant number of pancreatic patients' tumors for most of these ORFs. The pancreatic cancer-associated ORFs were also found to be genetically associated with other neoplasms, including leukemia, malignant melanoma, neuroblastoma and prostate carcinomas, as well as other unrelated diseases and disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease, coronary diseases, attention deficit disorder and addiction. CONCLUSION: Based on Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), copy number variations, somatic mutational status and correlation of gene expression in pancreatic tumors at the mRNA and protein level, expression specificity in normal tissues and detection in body fluids, six ORFs emerged as putative leads for pancreatic cancer. These six targets provide a basis for accelerated drug discovery and diagnostic marker development for pancreatic cancer.","['Narayanan, Ramaswamy']",['Narayanan R'],"['Department of Biological Sciences, Charles E.

The patients with glioblastoma have median survival of less than 12 months, despite advances in radiotherapeutical, chemotherapeutical and conventional surgical modalities. Retinoic acids are known to effect in vitro proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in colon, prostate, lung, and leukemia cancers. Retinoids are known to have anti-proliferation, anti-migration, and anti-invasive activity against human malignant gliomas, suggesting that retinoids are suitable anticancer agents to inhibit progression of tumors. Recurrent malignant cerebral gliomas have been treated with ATRA and 13-cis RA. However, the side effects associated with the use of high doses of retinoic acid demand for some more potent derivative free from such effects. The present clinical trials are undertaken to investigate the clinical safety and possible efficacy of administering retinoic acid naphthalene triazole (RANT) to patients with recurrent malignant gliomas. The toxicities observed in the patients during RANT treatment were mild. These preliminary results suggest that RANT is more potent compared to RA against recurrent malignant gliomas.","['Jia, Pi-Feng', 'Gu, Wei-Ting', 'Zhang, Wei-Feng', 'Li, Feng']","['Jia PF', 'Gu WT', 'Zhang WF', 'Li F']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Rui Jin Hospital North, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, No. 888 Shuangding Road, Shanghai, 201800, China, jiapifeng776@tom.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20150106,Italy,Neurol Sci,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,100959175,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Glioma/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Naphthalenes/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2015/01/07 06:00,2016/01/20 06:00,['2015/01/07 06:00'],"['2014/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10072-014-2025-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurol Sci. 2015 May;36(5):717-21. doi: 10.1007/s10072-014-2025-9.

Since then, Hh signaling has been implicated in regulation of differentiation, proliferation, tissue polarity, stem cell population and carcinogenesis. The first link of Hh signaling to cancer was established through discovery of genetic mutations of Hh receptor gene PTCH1 being responsible for Gorlin syndrome in 1996. It was later shown that Hh signaling is associated with many types of cancer, including skin, leukemia, lung, brain and gastrointestinal cancers. Another important milestone for the Hh research field is the FDA approval for the clinical use of Hh inhibitor Erivedge/Vismodegib for treatment of locally advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinomas. However, recent clinical trials of Hh signaling inhibitors in pancreatic, colon and ovarian cancer all failed, indicating a real need for further understanding of Hh signaling in cancer. In this review, we will summarize recent progress in the Hh signaling mechanism and its role in human cancer.","['Jia, Yanfei', 'Wang, Yunshan', 'Xie, Jingwu']","['Jia Y', 'Wang Y', 'Xie J']","['Central Laboratory, Jinan Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA155086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA155086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20150106,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",PMC4630008,['NIHMS653249'],2015/01/07 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/01/07 06:00'],"['2014/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00204-014-1433-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2015 Feb;89(2):179-91. doi: 10.1007/s00204-014-1433-1.

A pentamethine compound, E-84 (compound 50), showed inhibition on PRMT1 at the micromolar level and 6- to 25-fold selectivity over CARM1, PRMT5, and PRMT8. The cellular activity suggests that compound 50 permeated the cellular membrane, inhibited cellular PRMT1 activity, and blocked leukemia cell proliferation.

We found seven cohort studies (1241 patients) showing a significantly higher overall survival (OS) among carriers of the variant allele of 1236C>T at year 4 (odds ratio (OR): 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-2.01), 2677G>T/A at years 4-5 (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.01-1.86) and 3435C>T at years 3 (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.03-1.94) and 4-5 (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.05-1.91). In the subgroup analysis according to ethnicity, Caucasians carrying variant allele showed consistent results in OS. ABCB1 influence upon complete remission could not be demonstrated. Future studies based on larger populations and multiethnic groups should help clarify the effect of P-gp polymorphisms upon other outcomes.","['Megias-Vericat, J E', 'Rojas, L', 'Herrero, M J', 'Boso, V', 'Montesinos, P', 'Moscardo, F', 'Poveda, J L', 'Sanz, M A', 'Alino, S F']","['Megias-Vericat JE', 'Rojas L', 'Herrero MJ', 'Boso V', 'Montesinos P', 'Moscardo F', 'Poveda JL', 'Sanz MA', 'Alino SF']","['1] Unidad de Farmacogenetica, Instituto Investigacion Sanitaria La Fe and Area del Medicamento Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe.

Here, a novel biosensor is developed for simultaneous electrochemical detection of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and lysozyme (Lys) based on aptamer recognition by coupling ""signal-on"" and ""signal-off"" modes. On one Au electrode, two kinds of signaling probes labeled by the thiolated ferrocene (Fc)- and methy blue (MB)- were designed to hybridize with IFN-gamma and Lys aptamers respectively to form partial complementary DNA duplexes. In the presence of IFN-gamma and Lys, the target-aptamer interaction led to the release of aptamer from duplex DNA structure. The single-stranded signaling probes thus suffered from the conformation changes, which resulted in the decreased (or increased) oxidation peak current of Fc (or MB) according to the ""signal-off (or signal-on)"" mode. Electrodes were characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Under the optimized conditions, the signal changes were quantified using square wave voltammetry (SWV). This proposed biosensor for IFN-gamma and Lys possessed linear detection range from 0.01 to 10 nM and 0.1 to 100 nM, with the detection limits of 1.14x10(-3) nM and 0.0164 nM, respectively. Moreover, this biosensor was readily regenerated and proved successful toward the practical analysis. The proposed strategy could provide more integrated and reliable information for acute leukemia evaluation.","['Xia, Jianfei', 'Song, Daimin', 'Wang, Zonghua', 'Zhang, Feifei', 'Yang, Min', 'Gui,

Therefore, appropriate and effective interventions are essential in order to decrease burden. The goal of the present research was to determine the effect of a family need-based program on the burden of care in caregivers of leukemia patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this clinical research, 70 caregivers of leukemia patients who referred to Sayed Al-Shohada Medical Center in Isfahan, Iran were chosen and divided, through convenient sampling method and using table of random numbers, into two groups, experimental and control. Caregivers of the experimental group attended five training sessions. The data collection tool of this study was the Zarit Burden Scale. It was completed by members of both groups before, immediately after, and 1 month after the intervention. The data obtained were analyzed with SPSS software. RESULTS: During the study period, burden slowly decreased in the experimental group and increased in the control group. Mean burden of care score before, immediately after, and 1 month after the intervention was 63.6, 30.4, and 23.03, respectively, in the experimental group and 62.5, 67.3, and 68.8, respectively, in the control group. In addition, the mean burden score in the experimental group significantly decreased in comparison with the control group (P < 0.001).

The study was started by purposive sampling and continued by theoretical one. The data were analyzed based on the content analysis method. RESLUTS: Data analysis showed that insolvency, knapsack problems, cancer secrecy, trust on God, self-sacrifice, adaptation, medical malpractice, and hospital facilities were the level 3 codes of parents' experiences and ""parents a dead end life"" was the main theme of this study. CONCLUSION: In this study, the experiences of the parents whose children suffered from cancer were studied deeply by the use of qualitative method, especially by the use of resources syncretism rather than studying quantitatively. Parents a dead end life emerged as the main theme of this study, emphasizing the necessity of paying further attention to the parents. On the other hand, making more use of parents' experiences and encouraging them helps make the treatment more effective.

Adverse drug reactions, such as interpatient variability in sensitivity to ara-C, are considerable and may cause difficulties during chemotherapy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can play a significant role in modifying nucleoside-drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and thus the development of adverse effects. Our aim was to determine whether polymorphisms in genes encoding transporters and enzymes responsible for the metabolism of ara-C are associated with toxicity and clinical outcome in a patient population with childhood ALL. PROCEDURE: We studied 8 SNPs in the CDA, DCK, DCTD, SLC28A3, and SLC29A1 genes in 144 patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated according to ALLIC BFM 1990, 1995 and 2002 protocols. RESULTS: DCK rs12648166 and DCK rs4694362 SNPs were associated with hematologic toxicity (OR = 2.63, CI 95% = 1.37-5.04, P = 0.0036 and OR = 2.53, CI 95% = 1.34-4.80, P = 0.0044, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that DCK polymorphisms might be important genetic risk factors for hematologic toxicity during ALL treatment with ara-C. Individualized chemotherapy based on genetic profiling may help to optimize ara-C dosing, leading to improvements in clinical outcome and reduced toxicity.","['Gabor, Krisztina Mita', 'Schermann, Geza', 'Lautner-Csorba, Orsolya', 'Rarosi, Ferenc', 'Erdelyi, Daniel J', 'Endreffy, Emoke', 'Berek, Krisztina', 'Bartyik, Katalin', 'Bereczki, Csaba', 'Szalai, Csaba', 'Semsei, Agnes F']","['Gabor KM', 'Schermann G', 'Lautner-Csorba O', 'Rarosi F', 'Erdelyi DJ', 'Endreffy E', 'Berek K', 'Bartyik K', 'Bereczki C', 'Szalai C', 'Semsei AF']","['Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Health Care Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Szeged, Hungary.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20150103,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,,2015/01/06 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2015/01/06 06:00'],"['2014/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25379 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Apr;62(4):622-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25379.

Unfortunately, patients develop resistance and relapse due to bcr-abl point mutations and the persistence of leukemia initiating cells (LIC). Retinoids regulate vital biological processes such as cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, in particular of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The clinical usage of natural retinoids is hindered by acquired resistance and undesirable side effects. However, bioavailable and less toxic synthetic retinoids, such as the atypical adamantyl retinoid ST1926, have been developed and tested in cancer clinical trials. We investigated the preclinical efficacy of the synthetic retinoid ST1926 using human CML cell lines and the murine bone marrow transduction/transplantation CML model. In vitro, ST1926 induced irreversible growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase activation. Furthermore, ST1926 induced DNA damage and downregulated BCR-ABL. Most importantly, oral treatment with ST1926 significantly prolonged the longevity of primary CML mice, and reduced tumor burden. However, ST1926 did not eradicate LIC, evident by the ability of splenocytes isolated from treated primary mice to develop CML in untreated secondary recipients.

However, it is unknown whether the therapeutic results differ. Thus, we hypothesized that outcomes in resource-rich developing countries would be similar to those in industrialized regions. PROCEDURE: We performed a retrospective analysis of 224 consecutive children with ALL, who were treated according to the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) protocols between January 2001 and December 2007. High-risk (HR) and standard-risk (SR) patients were treated with modified CCG-1961 and CCG-1991 protocols, respectively. Modifications included substitution of dexamethasone for prednisone in HR patients and addition of two intrathecal methotrexate treatments for CNS2 patients during induction. All patients received double delayed intensification with two interim maintenance phases. RESULTS: Five-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 84.7 +/- 2.4%, 77.0 +/- 2.9%, and 81.4 +/- 2.7%, respectively. Remission was achieved in 98.1% of the patients. Induction failure and relapse rates were 1.9% and 15.1%, respectively. Death as the first event occurred in 6.4% of cases, of which 2.7% and 3.7% involved deaths in induction and remission, respectively. Interestingly, a significant reduction in induction deaths was observed over time. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the encouraging results observed in the present study, our patients displayed significantly lower survival outcomes compared to subjects treated in major clinical trials conducted by leading leukemia cooperative groups. Furthermore, this work underscores the need for targeted interventions to reduce death as the first event in developing regions.","['Jastaniah, Wasil', 'Elimam, Naglla', 'Abdalla, Khalid', 'Iqbal, Basheer Ahmed Cittana', 'Khattab, Taha M', 'Felimban, Sami', 'Abrar, Mohammed Burhan']","['Jastaniah W', 'Elimam N', 'Abdalla K', 'Iqbal BA', 'Khattab TM', 'Felimban S', 'Abrar MB']","['Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University and King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Umm AlQura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141231,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Health Resources', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2015/01/06 06:00,2015/07/23 06:00,['2015/01/06 06:00'],"['2014/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25374 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jun;62(6):945-50. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25374.

The TET dioxygenases catalyze iterative oxidation of 5mC, leading to eventual demethylation. Inactivation of TET enzymes causes multistage developmental defects, impaired cell reprogramming, and hematopoietic malignancies. However, little is known about how TET activity is regulated. Here we show that all three TET proteins bind to VprBP and are monoubiquitylated by the VprBP-DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4(VprBP)) on a highly conserved lysine residue. Deletion of VprBP in oocytes abrogated paternal DNA hydroxymethylation in zygotes. VprBP-mediated monoubiquitylation promotes TET binding to chromatin. Multiple recurrent TET2-inactivating mutations derived from leukemia target either the monoubiquitylation site (K1299) or residues essential for VprBP binding. Cumulatively, our data demonstrate that CRL4(VprBP) is a critical regulator of TET dioxygenases during development and in tumor suppression.","['Nakagawa, Tadashi', 'Lv, Lei', 'Nakagawa, Makiko', 'Yu, Yanbao', 'Yu, Chao', ""D'Alessio, Ana C"", 'Nakayama, Keiko', 'Fan, Heng-Yu', 'Chen, Xian', 'Xiong, Yue']","['Nakagawa T', 'Lv L', 'Nakagawa M', 'Yu Y', 'Yu C', ""D'Alessio AC"", 'Nakayama K', 'Fan HY', 'Chen X', 'Xiong Y']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Life Sciences Institute, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Division of Cell Proliferation, ART, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Sendai 980-8575, Japan.', 'Life Sciences Institute, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA163834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM067113/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA163834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM067113/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141231,United States,Mol Cell,Molecular cell,9802571,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Chromatin/*enzymology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dioxygenases/metabolism', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', '*Ubiquitination']",PMC4304937,['NIHMS646849'],2015/01/06 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2015/01/06 06:00'],"['2014/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1016/j.molcel.2014.12.002 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell. 2015 Jan 22;57(2):247-260. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2014.12.002.

The most potent compounds were two 3,4,5-trimethoxy phenyl analogues containing either an (Z)-indol-2-yl (8) or (Z)-benzo[b]furan-2-yl (12) moiety; these compounds exhibited GI50 values of <10 nM against 74% and 70%, respectively, of the human cancer cell lines in the 60-cell panel. Compounds 8, and 12 and two previously reported compounds in the same structural class, i.e. 29 and 31, also showed potent anti-leukemic activity against leukemia MV4-11 cell lines with LD50 values = 44 nM, 47 nM, 18 nM, and 180 nM, respectively. From the NCI anti-cancer screening results and the data from the in vitro toxicity screening on cultured AML cells, seven compounds: 8, 12, 21, 23, 25, 29 and 31 were screened for their in vitro inhibitory activity on tubulin polymerization in MV4-11 AML cells; at 50 nM, 8 and 29 inhibited polymerization of tubulin by >50%. The binding modes of the three most active compounds (8, 12 and 29) to tubulin were also investigated utilizing molecular docking studies. All three molecules were observed to bind in the same hydrophobic pocket at the interface of alpha- and beta-tubulin that is occupied by colchicine, and were stabilized by van der Waals' interactions with surrounding tubulin residues. The results from the tubulin polymerization and molecular docking studies indicate that compounds 8 and 29 are the most potent anti-leukemic compounds in this structural class, and are considered lead compounds for further development as anti-leukemic drugs.","['Penthala, Narsimha Reddy', 'Zong, Hongliang', 'Ketkar, Amit', 'Madadi, Nikhil Reddy', 'Janganati, Venumadav', 'Eoff, Robert L', 'Guzman, Monica L', 'Crooks, Peter A']","['Penthala NR', 'Zong H', 'Ketkar A', 'Madadi NR', 'Janganati V', 'Eoff RL', 'Guzman ML', 'Crooks PA']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205-7199, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205-7199, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205-7199, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205-7199, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205-7199, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205-7199, USA.

PROCEDURE: Fifty-eight (33 males) adult survivors, aged 24.5 +/- 4.4, underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) at 16.6 +/- 5.8 years after completion of treatment. Myocardial iron load and fibrosis were quantified using respectively T2* scan and late gadolinium enhancement. Right and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was measured by CMR, while myocardial function was assessed using tissue Doppler imaging. RESULTS: None of the survivors had significant myocardial iron overload (T2*<20 msec). The prevalence of LV and RV fibrosis was 9% (5/58) and 38% (22/58), respectively. Left ventricular EF was subnormal (EF 45-<55%) in 9% (5/58), while RV EF was abnormal (EF <45%) in 12% (7/58) and subnormal in 34% (20/58) of survivors. Patients with LV fibrosis had significantly lower mitral annular early diastolic velocity (P = 0.01) and smaller LV end-systolic volume (P = 0.02), while those with RV fibrosis had significantly lower tricuspid late diastolic annular velocity (P = 0.02) and early to late diastolic annular velocity ratio (P = 0.02) compared to those without. Cumulative anthracycline dose correlated with early diastolic mitral (r = -0.28, P = 0.038) and tricuspid (r = -0.40, P = 0.002) annular velocities, but not LV and RV EF or fibrosis (all P > 0.05).

FoxM1 overexpression has been reported to be related with many types of cancer. However, it is not known whether it contributes to oncogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Siomycin A, a thiazol antibiotic, is known to inhibit FoxM1 transcriptional activity. In this study, we aimed to determine gene expression levels of FoxM1 in Jurkat cells (T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line) and therapeutic potential of targeting FoxM1 by siomycin A alone and in combination with dexamethasone which improves the survival of children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We also examined the molecular mechanisms of siomycin A and dexamethasone-induced cell death in Jurkat cells. We demonstrated that FoxM1 mRNA is highly expressed in Jurkat cells. Dexamethasone and siomycin A caused a significant reduction in gene expression levels of FoxM1 in Jurkat cells.

METHODS: Parents of 127 long-term survivors of childhood ALL treated on a chemotherapy-only protocol at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital participated in the study. Parents completed standard ratings of emotional distress, caregiver strain, and child physical, emotional, and psychosocial functioning. Multivariable hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to examine associations between symptoms of caregiver strain, survivor functioning, and parent emotional distress. Covariates included parent education, survivor age, survivor sex, and time since childhood cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: On average, few parents reported significant symptoms of emotional distress. Clinically significant levels of anxiety and depression were reported by 7.1% and 3.1% of parents, respectively. Only 3.9% of parents endorsed significant symptoms of posttraumatic stress. Perceived caregiver strain was significantly associated with symptoms of parent anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress. Parent-report of child emotional functioning was significantly associated with symptoms of parent anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Most parents of long-term survivors of ALL exhibit low levels of emotional distress in the context of rates observed in the general population. Perceived caregiver strain was significantly associated with parent emotional distress. Further research is required to examine specific sources of caregiver strain, as well as other risk and protective factors associated with parent emotional distress symptoms.","['Malpert, Adele V', 'Kimberg, Cara', 'Luxton, Joshua', 'Mullins, Larry L', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'Brinkman, Tara M']","['Malpert AV', 'Kimberg C', 'Luxton J', 'Mullins LL', 'Pui CH', 'Hudson MM', 'Krull KR', 'Brinkman TM']","['Department of Psychology, Rhodes College, Memphis, TN, USA.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Psychology, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH085849/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MH85849/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141229,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anxiety/epidemiology', 'Caregivers/*psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Depression/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology/therapy', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Stress, Psychological/*epidemiology', 'Survivors/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors']",PMC4485981,['NIHMS665471'],2015/01/06 06:00,2017/02/01 06:00,['2015/01/06 06:00'],"['2014/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pon.3732 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2015 Sep;24(9):1116-23. doi: 10.1002/pon.3732.

Here, we report a DNA methylation mark that is characteristic of seven studied malignancies, namely cancers of lung, breast, prostate, pancreas, colorectum, glioblastoma and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (n = 137). This mark was defined by substantial hypermethylation at the promoter and first exon of growth hormone secretagouge receptor (GHSR) through bisulfite pyrosequencing. The degree of aberrant methylation was capable of accurate discrimination between cancer and control samples. The highest sensitivity and specificity of cancer detection was achieved for cancers of pancreas, lung, breast and CLL yielding the area under the curve (AUC) values of 1.0000, 0.9952, 0.9800 and 0.9400, respectively. Narrowing to a single CpG site within the gene's promoter or four consecutive CpG units of the highest methylation levels within the first exon improved the detection power. GHSR hypermethylation was detected already at the early stage tumors. The accurate performance of this marker was further replicated in an independent set of pancreatic cancer and control samples (n = 78). These findings support the candidature of GHSR methylation as a highly accurate pan-cancer marker.","['Moskalev, Evgeny A', 'Jandaghi, Pouria', 'Fallah, Mahdi', 'Manoochehri, Mehdi', 'Botla, Sandeep K', 'Kolychev, Oleg V', 'Nikitin, Evgeny A', 'Bubnov, Vladymyr V', 'von Knebel Doeberitz, M', 'Strobel, Oliver', 'Hackert, Thilo', 'Buchler, Markus W', 'Giese, Nathalia', 'Bauer, Andrea', 'Muley, Thomas', 'Warth, Arne', 'Schirmacher, Peter', 'Haller, Florian', 'Hoheisel, Jorg D', 'Riazalhosseini, Yasser']","['Moskalev EA', 'Jandaghi P', 'Fallah M', 'Manoochehri M', 'Botla SK', 'Kolychev OV', 'Nikitin EA', 'Bubnov VV', 'von Knebel Doeberitz M', 'Strobel O', 'Hackert T', 'Buchler MW', 'Giese N', 'Bauer A', 'Muley T', 'Warth A', 'Schirmacher P', 'Haller F', 'Hoheisel JD', 'Riazalhosseini Y']","['Functional Genome Analysis, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Diagnostic Molecular Pathology, Institute of Pathology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Functional Genome Analysis, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Functional Genome Analysis, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Functional Genome Analysis, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Military Training Research Center, Zhukovsky - Gagarin Air Force Academy, Voronezh, Russia.', 'Molecular Haematology, National Research Centre for Haematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Genomics and Immunology, Odessa State Medical University, Odessa, Ukraine.', 'Department of Applied Tumor Biology, Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Surgery, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Surgery, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Surgery, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Surgery, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Functional Genome Analysis, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Translational Research Unit, Thoraxklinik Heidelberg at Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Pneumology, Translational Lung Research Centre Heidelberg (TLRC-H), Member of the German Centre for Lung Research (DZL), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Diagnostic Molecular Pathology, Institute of Pathology, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany.', 'Functional Genome Analysis, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Functional Genome Analysis, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Current address: Department of Human Genetics and McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre, Montreal, Quebec.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adult', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'ROC Curve', 'Receptors, Ghrelin/analysis/*genetics']",PMC4414200,,2015/01/06 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/01/06 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['2759 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2759 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Feb 28;6(6):4418-27. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2759.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Ghrelin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown excesses in long-term mortality within high-risk groups defined by demographic and treatment characteristics. METHODS: To investigate conditional survival in a pediatric cancer population, the authors performed an analysis of conditional survival in the original Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) cohort and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database registry. The overall probability of death for patients at 5 years and 10 years after they survived 5, 10, 15, and 20 years since cancer diagnosis and cause-specific death in 10 years for 5-year survivors were estimated using the cumulative incidence method. RESULTS: Among patients in the CCSS and SEER cohorts who were alive 5 years after their cancer diagnosis, within each diagnosis group at least 92% were alive in the subsequent 5 years, except for patients with leukemia, of whom only 88% of 5-year survivors remained alive in the subsequent 5 years. The probability of all-cause mortality in the next 10 years among patients who survived at least 5 years after diagnosis was 8.8% in CCSS and 10.6% in SEER, approximately 75% of which was due to neoplasms as the cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of death among survivors of pediatric cancer in 10 years can vary between diagnosis groups by at most 12%, even up to 20 years after diagnosis. This information is clinically significant when counseling patients regarding their conditional survival, particularly when survivors are seen in long-term follow-up.","['Mertens, Ann C', 'Yong, Jian', 'Dietz, Andrew C', 'Kreiter, Erin', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Bleyer, Archie', 'Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Wasilewski-Masker, Karen']","['Mertens AC', 'Yong J', 'Dietz AC', 'Kreiter E', 'Yasui Y', 'Bleyer A', 'Armstrong GT', 'Robison LL', 'Wasilewski-Masker K']","[""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.""]",['eng'],"['U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20141229,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Effect Modifier, Epidemiologic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC4368489,['NIHMS652630'],2015/01/06 06:00,2015/05/23 06:00,['2015/01/06 06:00'],"['2014/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2014/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29170 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Apr 1;121(7):1108-17. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29170.

Additionally, the humanized antibody designated IGN523 demonstrated robust tumor growth inhibition in leukemic cell-line derived xenograft models and was as efficacious as standard of care carboplatin in patient-derived nonsmall lung cancer xenografts. In vitro studies revealed that IGN523 elicited strong ADCC activity, induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization and inhibited essential amino acid transport function, ultimately resulting in caspase-3 and -7-mediated apoptosis of tumor cells.

They barely contribute to chimeric embryos when injected into blastocysts. Reprogramming of EpiSCs to embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like cells (rESCs) may occur in response to LIF-STAT3 signaling; however, low reprogramming efficiency hampers potential use of rESCs in generating chimeras. Here, we describe dramatic improvement of conversion efficiency from primed to naive-like PSCs through upregulation of E-cadherin in the presence of the cytokine LIF. Analysis revealed that blocking nuclear localization of beta-CATENIN with small-molecule inhibitors significantly enhances reprogramming efficiency of mouse EpiSCs. Although activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signals has been thought desirable for maintenance of naive PSCs, this study provides the evidence that inhibition of nuclear translocation of beta-CATENIN enhances conversion of mouse EpiSCs to naive-like PSCs (rESCs). This affords better understanding of gene regulatory circuits underlying pluripotency and reprogramming of PSCs.","['Murayama, Hideyuki', 'Masaki, Hideki', 'Sato, Hideyuki', 'Hayama, Tomonari', 'Yamaguchi, Tomoyuki', 'Nakauchi, Hiromitsu']","['Murayama H', 'Masaki H', 'Sato H', 'Hayama T', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Nakauchi H']","['Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan; Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, 265 Campus Drive, Stanford, CA 94305-5461, USA.

AIM AND OBJECTIVES: This study investigated substitutions in the ATP synthase subunit 6 gene of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as a potential diagnostic biomarker for early detection and diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Based on mtDNA from 23 subjects diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, approximately 465 bp of the ATP synthase subunit 6 gene were amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: The sequencing revealed thirty-one mutations at 14 locations in ATP synthase subunit 6 of mtDNA in the ALL subjects. All were identified as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a homoplasmic pattern. The mutations were distributed between males and females. Novel haplotypes were identified in this investigation: haplotype (G) was recorded in 34% in diagnosed subjects; the second haplotype was (C) with frequency of 13% in ALL subjects. Neither of these were observed in control samples. CONCLUSIONS: These haplotypes were identified for the first time in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. Five mutations able to change amino acid synthesis for the ATP synthase subunit 6 were associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Recent research has focused on effect of red andf processed meat intake as a risk factor, but with inconclusive results. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of data published to date, to ascertain the overall association between intake and NHL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A published literature search was performed through Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Medline, and Science Citation Index Expanded databases for articles published in English. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated using random or fixed effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using Chi-square and I2 statistics. Dissemination bias was evaluated by funnel plot analysis.We performed a formal meta-analysis using summary measures from these studies. RESULTS: In total, 11 published studies were included in the final analysis. The combined analysis revealed that there was significant association between the red meat and NHL risk (OR=1.10, 95%CI: 1.02 to 1.19, p=0.01). Additionally, there was showed significance association between processed red meat and NHL risk (OR=1.17, 95%CI: 1.06 to 1.29, p=0.001). In subgroup analysis, a statistical significant association was noted between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (OR=1.20, 95%CI: 1.04 to 2.37, P=0.01) and red meat intake. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-Analysis, there was evidence for association between consumption of red meat, or processed meat and risk of NHL, particularly with the DLBCL subtype in the red meat case.","['Fallahzadeh, Hosein', 'Cheraghi, Maria', 'Amoori, Neda', 'Alaf, Mehrangiz']","['Fallahzadeh H', 'Cheraghi M', 'Amoori N', 'Alaf M']","['Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Research Center of Prevention and Epidemiology of Non-Communicable Disease, Faculty of Health, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran E-mail : Epidemiology2012@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', '*Feeding Behavior', 'Food Handling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', '*Meat', 'Meat Products', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Swine']",,,2015/01/06 06:00,2015/09/10 06:00,['2015/01/06 06:00'],"['2015/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.23.10421 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2014;15(23):10421-5. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2014.15.23.10421.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: HL-60 cells were stably transfected with NF-kappaBp65 siRNAP53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) siRNA (PUMA siRNA) and Slug siRNA respectively or exposed to 25 nM U0126 for 24h, then the cells were exposed to Cyt (250 nM) respectively. In different time point after Cyt treatment, the activity of NF-kappaB and the expression of Erk1/2, NF-kappaBp65, Slug and PUMA protein were detected. The cells survival rate and apoptotic index were detected by MTT and TUNEL methods. RESULTS: After the HL-60 cells were exposed to Cyt (250 nM) for 24 h, the activity of NF-kappaB reached maximum value, and reached minimum value for 48 h. The expressions of NF-kappaBp65 and PUMA reached maximum value after exporser to Cyt (250 nM) for 24 h, and reached minimum value after 48 h. Erk1/2 phosphorylation and Slug expression began to increase after exporser to Cyt (250 nM) for 24 h, and reached maximum value for 48 h. The cells survival rate was decreased, and arrived to minimum value (29.5 +/- 4.6, F = 12.74, p < 0.01). The cells apotosis rate was increased, and arrived to maximum value (14.2 +/- 2.8, F = 15.02, p < 0.01). By inhibiting NF-kappaBp65 or PUMA by siRNA transfection, the cells survival rate was enhanced and the apotosis rate was significantly declined after exporsed to Cyt (250 nM). When NF-kappaBp65 was inhibited, the expression of PUMA was decreased. By inhibiting Erk1/2 phosphorylation and Slug expression, the cells survival rate began to decrease for 24 h, and reached the fewest at 48 h after exporsed to Cyt (250 nM) (19.8 +/- 2.7, F = 11.4, p < 0.01 and 17.4 +/- 0.6, F = 15.3, p < 0.01). The cells apotosis rate began to increase from 24 h, and reach a head at 48 h after exporser to Cyt (250 nM) (28.6 +/- 4.7, F = 9.84, p < 0.01 and 27.6 +/- 6.4, F = 10.31, p < 0.01. After Erk1/2 phosphorylation inhibited, Slug expression was lowered and PUMA expression was significantly increased. The changes are most distinct after the cells were exporser to Cyt (250 nM) for 48 h. By Slug inhibition had no effect on Erk1/2 phosphorylation, but increase the expression of PUMA. CONCLUSIONS: The chemosensitiveness of HL-60 cells to Cyt were relation to the up-regulation of PUMA induced by NF-kappaB. The chemoresistance to Cyt was related to the up-regulation of Slug induced by Erk1/2, which inhibited the expression of PUMA.","['Liu, G-J', 'Pan, G-J', 'Wang, J', 'Wang, L-N', 'Xu, Y', 'Tang, Y']","['Liu GJ', 'Pan GJ', 'Wang J', 'Wang LN', 'Xu Y', 'Tang Y']","[""Department of Cytology Laboratory, People's Hospital of Linyi, Shandong, China. tangyongtj@126.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques/*methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Snail Family Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/*physiology']",,,2015/01/06 06:00,2015/08/25 06:00,['2015/01/04 06:00'],"['2015/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2014;18(24):3802-9.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SNAI1 protein, human)', '0 (Snail Family Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the safety and activity of ibrutinib in previously untreated and relapsed or refractory CLL with TP53 aberrations. METHODS: In this investigator-initiated, single-arm phase 2 study, we enrolled eligible adult patients with active CLL with TP53 aberrations at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (Bethesda, MD, USA). Patients received 28-day cycles of ibrutinib 420 mg orally once daily until disease progression or the occurrence of limiting toxicities. The primary endpoint was overall response to treatment at 24 weeks in all evaluable patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01500733, and is fully enrolled. FINDINGS: Between Dec 22, 2011, and Jan 2, 2014, we enrolled 51 patients; 47 had CLL with deletion 17p13.1 and four carried a TP53 mutation in the absence of deletion 17p13.1. All patients had active disease requiring therapy. 35 enrolled patients had previously untreated CLL and 16 had relapsed or refractory disease. Median follow-up was 24 months (IQR 12.9-27.0). 33 previously untreated patients and 15 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL were evaluable for response at 24 weeks. 32 (97%; 95% CI 86-100) of 33 previously untreated patients achieved an objective response, including partial response in 18 patients (55%) and partial response with lymphocytosis in 14 (42%). One patient had progressive disease at 0.4 months. 12 (80%; 95% CI 52-96) of the 15 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL had an objective response: six (40%) achieved a partial response and six (40%) a partial response with lymphocytosis; the remaining three (20%) patients had stable disease. Grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia in 12 (24%) patients (grade 4 in one [2%] patient), anaemia in seven (14%) patients, and thrombocytopenia in five (10%) patients (grade 4 in one [2%] patient). Grade 3 pneumonia occurred in three (6%) patients, and grade 3 rash in one (2%) patient. INTERPRETATION: The activity and safety profile of single-agent ibrutinib in CLL with TP53 aberrations is encouraging and supports its consideration as a novel treatment option for patients with this high-risk disease in both first-line and second-line settings.

Our objective in the current study was to examine risk factors for survival and treatment outcome in 261 'young' adults with CMML, as defined by age 65 years. In multivariable analysis, lower HB (P=0.01), higher circulating blast % (P=0.002), ASXL1 (P=0.0007) and SRSF2 mutations (P=0.008) and Mayo-French cytogenetic stratification (P=0.04) negatively impacted survival. Similarly, leukemia-free survival was independently affected by higher circulating blast % (P<0.0001), higher bone marrow blast % (P=0.0007) and the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells (P=0.0002). Seventy-five (29%) patients received hypomethylating agents (HMA), with the median number of cycles being 5, and the median duration of therapy being 5 months. The over-all response rate was 40% for azacitidine and 30% for decitabine. Fifty-three (24%) patients underwent an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT), with a response rate of 56% and a non-relapse mortality of 19%. Survival in young adults with CMML, although higher than in older patients, is poor and even worse in the presence of ASXL1 and SRSF2 mutations.

While elutriated and arrested cells have similar patterns of DNA content and cyclin expression, a large fraction of the proteome changes detected in arrested cells are found to reflect arrest-specific responses (i.e., starvation, DNA damage, CDK1 inhibition), rather than physiological cell cycle regulation.

Although various recurrent somatic mutations of DNMT3A have been described, the most common mutation is located at amino acid R882 in the methyltransferase domain of the gene. DNMT3A mutations have been reported to be stable during disease progression and are associated with unfavorable outcome in acute myeloid leukemia patients with normal karyotype. Because of their prognostic significance and high stability during disease evolution, DNMT3A mutations might represent highly informative biomarkers for minimal residual disease monitoring. We describe a new rapid diagnostic RT-PCR assay based on TauI restriction enzyme reaction to identify DNMT3A R882 mutations at diagnosis. In addition, we developed a sensitive and specific test based on peptide nucleic acid real-time PCR technology to monitor DNMT3A R882H mutation. We identified 24 DNMT3A R882H mutated patients out of 134 acute myeloid leukemia screened samples and we analyzed in these patients the kinetics of minimal residual disease after induction and consolidation therapy. This assay may be useful to better assess response to therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia bearing the DNMT3A R882H mutation.","['Mancini, Melissa', 'Hasan, Syed Khizer', 'Ottone, Tiziana', 'Lavorgna, Serena', 'Ciardi, Claudia', 'Angelini, Daniela F', 'Agostini, Francesca', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Mancini M', 'Hasan SK', 'Ottone T', 'Lavorgna S', 'Ciardi C', 'Angelini DF', 'Agostini F', 'Venditti A', 'Lo-Coco F']","['Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, The University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; Neuro-Oncohematology Unit, The Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Oncology ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre Navi Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, The University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; Neuro-Oncohematology Unit, The Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, The University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; Neuro-Oncohematology Unit, The Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, The University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; Neuro-Oncohematology Unit, The Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'Neuroimmunology and Flow Cytometry Units, The Santa Lucia Foundation-I.R.C.C.S., Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, The University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, The University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, The University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy; Neuro-Oncohematology Unit, The Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.

We developed a DNA real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method for quantification of BCR-ABL1 sequences, which is also potentially suitable for routine use. The BCR-ABL1 breakpoint was sequenced after isolation by nested short-range PCR of DNA from blood, marrow, and cells on slides, obtained either at diagnosis or during treatment, or from artificial mixtures. PCR primers were chosen from a library of presynthesized and pretested BCR (n = 19) and ABL1 (n = 568) primers. BCR-ABL1 sequences were quantified relative to BCR sequences in 521 assays on 266 samples from 92 patients. For minimal residual disease detectable by DNA qPCR and RT-qPCR, DNA qPCR gave similar minimal residual disease results as RT-qPCR but had better precision at low minimal residual disease levels. The limit of detection of DNA qPCR depended on the amount of DNA assayed, being 10(-5.8) when 5 mug was assayed and 10(-7.0) when 80 mug was assayed. DNA qPCR may be useful and practical for monitoring the increasing number of patients with minimal residual disease around or below the limit of detection of RT-qPCR as the assay itself is simple and the up-front costs will be amortized if sequential assays are performed.","['Bartley, Paul A', 'Latham, Susan', 'Budgen, Bradley', 'Ross, David M', 'Hughes, Elizabeth', 'Branford, Susan', 'White, Deborah', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Morley, Alexander A']","['Bartley PA', 'Latham S', 'Budgen B', 'Ross DM', 'Hughes E', 'Branford S', 'White D', 'Hughes TP', 'Morley AA']","['Department of Haematology and Genetic Pathology, School of Medicine, Flinders University and Medical Centre, Bedford Park, South Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology and Genetic Pathology, School of Medicine, Flinders University and Medical Centre, Bedford Park, South Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology and Genetic Pathology, School of Medicine, Flinders University and Medical Centre, Bedford Park, South Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology and Genetic Pathology, School of Medicine, Flinders University and Medical Centre, Bedford Park, South Australia, Australia; Haematology Division, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology and Genetic Pathology, School of Medicine, Flinders University and Medical Centre, Bedford Park, South Australia, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Haematology Division, SA Pathology, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology and Genetic Pathology, School of Medicine, Flinders University and Medical Centre, Bedford Park, South Australia, Australia; Monoquant Pty.

However, advances in high-throughput sequencing provide an opportunity to improve complex clinical sequencing applications. Our goal was to determine whether high-throughput sequencing technology could reliably perform the sequencing required for somatic hypermutation analysis and improve clinical testing for chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. Blood or liquid bone marrow aspirate samples from 50 different patients were evaluated in parallel using a validated clinical assay based on Sanger sequencing and a modified protocol in which the sequencing was performed using an Ion Torrent personal genome machine. In each case, both methods gave identical results with respect to interpreted somatic hypermutation status and dominant immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene reported.

However, BLV is estimated to cost the dairy industry hundreds of millions of dollars annually and this is likely a conservative estimate. BLV is not thought to cause animal distress or serious pathology unless infection progresses to leukemia or lymphoma. However, a wealth of research supports the notion that BLV infection causes widespread abnormal immune function. BLV infection can impact cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system and alter proper functioning of uninfected cells. Despite strong evidence of abnormal immune signaling and functioning, little research has investigated the large-scale effects of BLV infection on host immunity and resistance to other infectious diseases. This review focuses on mechanisms of immune suppression associated with BLV infection, specifically aberrant signaling, proliferation and apoptosis, and the implications of switching from BLV latency to activation. In addition, this review will highlight underdeveloped areas of research relating to BLV infection and how it causes immune suppression.","['Frie, Meredith C', 'Coussens, Paul M']","['Frie MC', 'Coussens PM']","['Department of Animal Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA; Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Program, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.

However, there are few data evaluating performance of clofarabine in populations of patients not enrolled in clinical trials. We reviewed outcomes for 84 patients treated with clofarabine for relapsed or refractory AML or MDS, either with clofarabine as monotherapy (n=19) or in combination with cytarabine (n=65). Using International Working Group (IWG) response criteria, the overall response rate (ORR) of all treated patients was 21%, with a complete response rate with either complete or incomplete hematopoietic recovery (CRR=CR+CRi) of 14%. For combination therapy, ORR was 22% with CRR of 18%, and monotherapy patients had an ORR of 21% with CRR of 11%. Although limited by small numbers, subgroup analysis did not reveal variation in response rates when comparing different risk factors. The 30-day mortality was 21% and median survival was 3 months; a subset of 12 patients who were able to go to transplant had an 18-month median survival. Clofarabine's efficacy in a ""real-world"" setting appears to be less than has been reported in clinical trials, and treatment is associated with a high early mortality rate.","['Roberts, Daniel A', 'Wadleigh, Martha', 'McDonnell, Anne M', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Steensma, David P']","['Roberts DA', 'Wadleigh M', 'McDonnell AM', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Stone RM', 'Steensma DP']","['Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancies, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pharmacy, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Division of Hematological Malignancies, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancies, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancies, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.

Whereas some cats contain the infection and show a regressive course, others stay viremic and succumb to the infection within a few years. We hypothesized, that differences in the infection outcome might be causally linked to the viral RNA and provirus loads within the host and these loads therefore may give additional insight into the pathogenesis of the virus. Thus, the goals of the present study were to follow-up on experimentally infected cats and investigate tissues from cats with different infection outcomes using sensitive, specific TaqMan real-time PCR and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. Nineteen experimentally FeLV-A/Glasgow-1-infected cats were categorized into having regressive, progressive or reactivated FeLV infection according to follow-up of FeLV p27 antigen detection in the blood. Remarkably, regressively infected cats showed detectable provirus and viral RNA loads in almost all of the 27 tested tissues, even many years after virus exposure. Moreover, some regressively infected cats reactivated the infection, and these cats had intermediate to high viral RNA and provirus tissue loads. The highest loads were found in viremic cats, independent of their health status. Tissues that represented sites of virus replication and shedding revealed the highest viral RNA and provirus loads, while the lowest loads were present in muscle and nerve tissues. A supplementary analysis of 20 experimentally infected cats with progressive infection revealed a median survival time of 3.1 years (range from 0.6 to 6.5 years); approximately 70% (n=14) of these cats developed lymphoma, while leukemia and non-regenerative anemia were observed less frequently. Our results demonstrate that the different infection outcomes are associated with differences in viral RNA and provirus tissue loads. Remarkably, no complete clearance of FeLV viral RNA or provirus was detected in cats with regressive infection, even up to 12 years after exposure. In several cases FeLV reactivation could be observed. Thus, retroviruses integrated as provirus into the host's genome, could not be eliminated completely by the host and maintained their full potential for replication and reactivation.","['Helfer-Hungerbuehler, A Katrin', 'Widmer, Stefan', 'Kessler, Yvonne', 'Riond, Barbara', 'Boretti, Felicitas S', 'Grest, Paula', 'Lutz, Hans', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina']","['Helfer-Hungerbuehler AK', 'Widmer S', 'Kessler Y', 'Riond B', 'Boretti FS', 'Grest P', 'Lutz H', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R']","['Clinical Laboratory and Center for Clinical Studies, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.

In our patients, application of the SNP-A assay enabled sensitive detection of cryptic changes affecting clinically important genes in NK ALL. Therefore, this assay seems to be more advantageous compared to other conventional methods such as FISH assay, HemaVision (DNA Technology, Denmark), and conventional karyotyping for the detection of an ""unstable genotype"" at relapse, which may be associated with microscopic clonal evolution and poor prognosis.

However, submicroscopic deletions within IGH in B-ALL have not been rigorously assessed. In this study, we investigated characteristics of IGH submicroscopic deletions, by FISH, in B-ALL with IGH rearrangements. FISH was performed by using commercially available IGH dual-color break-apart rearrangement probes (Abbott/Vysis, Downers Grove, IL, USA; Kreatech, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The study group included seven B-ALL patients with IGH rearrangements, observed by FISH. Among them, two exhibited deletion of the 5' variable region of IGH by FISH. The B-ALL in these two patients included two kinds of abnormal cells; one had an IGH rearrangement without any IGH submicroscopic deletion, while the other had an IGH submicroscopic deletion, which showed that one normal fusion signal and one 3' IGH signal were detected. Thus, submicroscopic deletion of the IGH 5' variable region may have occurred in either the native or rearranged chromosome 14. These findings indicate that B-ALL with IGH rearrangements may be accompanied by submicroscopic deletions of the IGH 5' variable region, which can be detected by FISH. The clinical significance of such deletions is unclear, but the loss of part of the IGH gene in B-ALL warrants further study.","['Huh, Jungwon', 'Mun, Yeung Chul', 'Yoo, Eun Sun', 'Seong, Chu Myong', 'Chung, Wha Soon']","['Huh J', 'Mun YC', 'Yoo ES', 'Seong CM', 'Chung WS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ewha Womans University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141208,Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4272943,,2015/01/02 06:00,2016/11/15 06:00,['2015/01/02 06:00'],"['2014/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3343/alm.2015.35.1.128 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2015 Jan;35(1):128-31. doi: 10.3343/alm.2015.35.1.128.

These mutations have been comprehensively analyzed in adult AML, but not in childhood AML. We investigated possible alteration of the SETBP1, splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1), U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1), and serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) genes in childhood AML. METHODS: Cytogenetic and molecular analyses were performed to reveal chromosomal and genetic alterations. Sequence alterations in the SETBP1, SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2 genes were examined by using direct sequencing in a cohort of 53 childhood AML patients. RESULTS: Childhood AML patients did not harbor any recurrent SETBP1 gene mutations, although our study did identify a synonymous mutation in one patient. None of the previously reported aberrations in the mutational hotspot of SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2 were identified in any of the 53 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of the SETBP1 gene or SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2 genes are not common genetic events in childhood AML, implying that the mutations are unlikely to exert a driver effect in myeloid leukemogenesis during childhood.","['Choi, Hyun-Woo', 'Kim, Hye-Ran', 'Baek, Hee-Jo', 'Kook, Hoon', 'Cho, Duck', 'Shin, Jong-Hee', 'Suh, Soon-Pal', 'Ryang, Dong-Wook', 'Shin, Myung-Geun']","['Choi HW', 'Kim HR', 'Baek HJ', 'Kook H', 'Cho D', 'Shin JH', 'Suh SP', 'Ryang DW', 'Shin MG']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Brain Korea 21 Plus Project, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea. ; Laboratory of Metabolism, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea. ; Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea. ; Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea. ; Brain Korea 21 Plus Project, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea. ; Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141208,Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear/*genetics', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*genetics', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors', 'Splicing Factor U2AF']",PMC4272941,,2015/01/02 06:00,2016/11/15 06:00,['2015/01/02 06:00'],"['2014/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2014/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3343/alm.2015.35.1.118 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2015 Jan;35(1):118-22. doi: 10.3343/alm.2015.35.1.118.

Previous reports have identified considerable ethnic differences in the impact of HLA and KIR ligand mismatches, as well as KIR ligand status, on HSCT; however, to date, no data has been acquired in Korean adult patients. METHODS: We investigated the association of high-resolution HLA matching on five loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1), KIR ligand mismatching, and KIR ligand status on the outcome of allogeneic HSCT from unrelated donors in 154 Korean adult patients treated at Seoul National University Hospital. RESULTS: In a multivariate analysis, less than 9/10 allelic matches in five HLA loci was an independent risk factor for acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (grade II to IV) (P=0.019, odds ratio [OR]=2.7). In addition, HLA-A allele mismatching was increasingly prevalent in patients with acute GVHD compared to patients without (61.9% vs. 34.5%, P=0.06). For KIR ligand status, the patient and donor combination of both C1/C1 ligands showed better event-free and overall survival than combinations with C2 ligand patients or donors (P=0.048, P=0.034, respectively) by log-rank test. CONCLUSIONS: Korean adult transplant patients with less than 9 of 10 HLA allele matches in the HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and DQB1 loci have a higher likelihood of developing acute GVHD (grade II to IV). Impact of KIR ligand status on clinical outcome should be further studied in a larger patient population.","['Park, Hyewon', 'Rho, Eun Youn', 'In, Ji Won', 'Kim, Inho', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Park, Seonyang', 'Shin, Sue', 'Park, Kyoung Un', 'Song, Eun Young']","['Park H', 'Rho EY', 'In JW', 'Kim I', 'Yoon SS', 'Park S', 'Shin S', 'Park KU', 'Song EY']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. ; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seegene Medical Foundation, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141208,Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Female', 'Genetic Loci', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics/metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/standards', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Receptors, KIR/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Republic of Korea', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",PMC4272940,,2015/01/02 06:00,2016/11/15 06:00,['2015/01/02 06:00'],"['2014/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3343/alm.2015.35.1.111 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2015 Jan;35(1):111-7. doi: 10.3343/alm.2015.35.1.111.

We studied the frequency and type of CALR mutations and their hematological characteristics. METHODS: A total of 168 MPN patients (36 polycythemia vera [PV], 114 essential thrombocythemia [ET], and 18 primary myelofibrosis [PMF] cases) were included in the study. CALR mutation was analyzed by the direct sequencing method. RESULTS: CALR mutations were detected in 21.9% of ET and 16.7% of PMF patients, which accounted for 58.5% and 33.3% of ET and PMF patients without Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) or myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogenes (MPL) mutations, respectively. A total of five types of mutation were detected, among which, L367fs(*)46 (53.6%) and K385fs(*)47 (35.7%) were found to be the most common. ET patients with CALR mutation had lower leukocyte counts and ages compared with JAK2-mutated ET patients. CONCLUSION: Genotyping for CALR could be a useful diagnostic tool for JAK2-or MPL-negative ET or PMF patients. CALR mutation may be a distinct disease group, with different hematological characteristics than that of JAK2-positive patients.","['Ha, Jung-Sook', 'Kim, Yu-Kyung']","['Ha JS', 'Kim YK']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141208,Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC4272961,,2015/01/02 06:00,2016/11/15 06:00,['2015/01/02 06:00'],"['2014/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3343/alm.2015.35.1.22 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2015 Jan;35(1):22-7. doi: 10.3343/alm.2015.35.1.22.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) presents a 10- to 20-fold higher susceptibility to genetic mutations owing to the lack of introns and histone proteins. The mtDNA repair system is relatively inefficient, rendering it vulnerable to reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during ATP synthesis within the mitochondria, which can then target the mtDNA. Under conditions of chronic inflammation and excess stress, increased ROS production can overwhelm the antioxidant system, resulting in mtDNA damage. This paper reviews recent literature describing the pathophysiological implications of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and mitochondrial genome aberrations in aging hematopoietic stem cells, bone marrow failure syndromes, hematological malignancies, solid organ cancers, chronic inflammatory diseases, and other diseases caused by exposure to environmental hazards.","['Kim, Hye-Ran', 'Won, Stephanie Jane', 'Fabian, Claire', 'Kang, Min-Gu', 'Szardenings, Michael', 'Shin, Myung-Geun']","['Kim HR', 'Won SJ', 'Fabian C', 'Kang MG', 'Szardenings M', 'Shin MG']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea. ; Brain Korea 21 Project, Center for Biomedical Human Resources, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Integrative Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA.', 'Department of Cell Therapy, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea. ; Brain Korea 21 Project, Center for Biomedical Human Resources, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Korea.', 'Department of Cell Therapy, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea. ; Brain Korea 21 Project, Center for Biomedical Human Resources, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Korea. ; Environment Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20141208,Korea (South),Ann Lab Med,Annals of laboratory medicine,101571172,IM,"['DNA, Mitochondrial/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematologic Diseases/genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', '*Inflammation', 'Mitochondria/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",PMC4272938,,2015/01/02 06:00,2016/11/15 06:00,['2015/01/02 06:00'],"['2014/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/07 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3343/alm.2015.35.1.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Lab Med. 2015 Jan;35(1):1-14. doi: 10.3343/alm.2015.35.1.1.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of Bmi1 in the development of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) and its functional effect on the migration and invasion of TSCC. Initially, immunohistochemistry revealed that Bmi1 overexpression was a common event in premalignant dysplasia, primary TSCC, and lymph node metastases and was associated with a poor prognosis. A significant correlation between Bmi1 and SOD2 (manganese superoxide dismutase) expression was observed. Side population (SP) cells were used as cancer stem-like cells and further assessed by sphere and colony formation assays, and the expression of stem cell markers. TSCC cells with higher migration and invasion ability (UM1 cell lines) showed a higher proportion of SP cells and Bmi1 expression than TSCC cells with lower migration and invasion ability (UM2 cell lines). Knockdown of Bmi1 in UM1 or SP cells inhibited migration and invasion and decreased the sphere and colony formation, and the expression of stem cell markers and SOD2. Direct binding of C-myc to the Bmi1 promoter was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays. Moreover, C-myc knockdown in SP cells inhibited their migration and invasion and decreased the expression of Bmi1 and SOD2. Our results indicate that the deregulation of Bmi1 expression is a frequent event during the progression of TSCC and may have a prognostic value for patients with this disease. The Bmi1-mediated migration and invasion of TSCC is related to cancer stem-like cells and involves the C-myc-Bmi1-SOD2 pathway.","['He, Qianting', 'Liu, Zhonghua', 'Zhao, Tingting', 'Zhao, Luodan', 'Zhou, Xiaofeng', 'Wang, Anxun']","['He Q', 'Liu Z', 'Zhao T', 'Zhao L', 'Zhou X', 'Wang A']","['1.

DESIGN AND METHODS: The presence of NPM mutations in 100 Chinese patients newly diagnosed with AML were identified by RT-PCR and sequencing analysis. Copies of circulating NPM mutation A (NPM mut.A) DNA in the plasma of mutation-positive cases were quantified by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, the association of circulating NPM mutation levels and clinical characteristics was analyzed. RESULTS: NPM mutations were identified in 37 of the 100 patients and all cases were NPM mut.A. The circulating NPM mut.A levels ranged from 0.35x10(8) copies/ml to 6.0x10(8) copies/ml in the 37 mutation-positive cases. The medium and quartile M (P25, P75) of the circulating NPM mut.A levels in patients classified as M2, M4 and M5 morphological subtypes were 1.35x10(8) (0.76x10(8), 1.91x10(8)) copies/ml, 1.81x10(8) (1.47x10(8), 2.2x10(8)) copies/ml and 2.50x10(8) (2.42x10(8), 3.05x10(8)) copies/ml, respectively. Circulating NPM mut.A levels were significantly higher in patients with the M5 subtype of AML compared to patients with the M2 and M4 subtypes (p=0.000, p=0.046). In addition, circulating NPM mut.A copies were significantly associated with a higher white blood cell count, platelet count and bone marrow blast percentage (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that circulating NPM mutations DNA assay serves as a complementary to the routine investigative protocol of NPM-mutated leukemia.","['Quan, Jing', 'Gao, Yu-jie', 'Yang, Zai-lin', 'Chen, Hui', 'Xian, Jing-rong', 'Zhang, Shuai-shuai', 'Zou, Qin', 'Zhang, Ling']","['Quan J', 'Gao YJ', 'Yang ZL', 'Chen H', 'Xian JR', 'Zhang SS', 'Zou Q', 'Zhang L']","['1.

These proteins have some functional similarities with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) immediate early protein ICP0, which stimulates lytic HSV-1 infection and derepresses quiescent HSV-1 genomes. All three proteins counteract antiviral restriction mediated by one or more components of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, and IE1 and pp71, acting together, almost completely complement ICP0 null mutant HSV-1. Here, we investigated whether ICP0 might substitute for IE1 or pp71 during HCMV infection. Using human fibroblasts that express ICP0, IE1, or pp71 in an inducible manner, we found that ICP0 stimulated replication of both wild-type (wt) and pp71 mutant HCMV while IE1 increased wt HCMV plaque formation and completely complemented the IE1 mutant. Although ICP0 stimulated IE2 expression from IE1 mutant HCMV and increased the number of IE2-positive cells, it could not compensate for IE1 in full lytic replication. These results are consistent with previous evidence that both IE1 and IE2 are required for efficient HCMV gene expression, but they also imply that IE2 functionality is influenced specifically by IE1, either directly or indirectly, and that IE1 may include sequences that have HCMV-specific functions. We discovered a mutant form of IE1 (YL2) that fails to stimulate HCMV infection while retaining 30 to 80% of the activity of the wt protein in complementing ICP0 null mutant HSV-1. It is intriguing that the YL2 mutation is situated in the region of IE1 that is shared with IE2 and which is highly conserved among primate cytomegaloviruses. IMPORTANCE: Herpesvirus gene expression can be repressed by cellular restriction factors, one group of which is associated with structures known as ND10 or PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs). Regulatory proteins of several herpesviruses interfere with PML NB-mediated repression, and in some cases their activities are transferrable between different viruses. For example, the requirement for ICP0 during herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection can be largely replaced by ICP0-related proteins expressed by other alphaherpesviruses and even by a combination of the unrelated IE1 and pp71 proteins of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Here, we report that ICP0 stimulates gene expression and replication of wt HCMV but cannot replace the need for IE1 during infection by IE1-defective HCMV mutants. Therefore, IE1 includes HCMV-specific functions that cannot be replaced by ICP0.","['Lu, Yongxu', 'Everett, Roger D']","['Lu Y', 'Everett RD']","['Medical Research Council-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Medical Research Council-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom roger.everett@glasgow.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['MC_UU_12014/4/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141231,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*virology', 'Fibroblasts/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Herpes Simplex/*virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*enzymology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",PMC4337537,,2015/01/02 06:00,2015/05/27 06:00,['2015/01/02 06:00'],"['2015/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.03480-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.03480-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2015 Mar;89(6):3062-75. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03480-14.

A total of 903 patients had sufficient cytogenetic information available at stem cell transplantation to be classified according to the 5-group classification. Poor and very poor risk according to this classification was an independent predictor of shorter relapse-free survival (hazard ratio 1.40 and 2.14), overall survival (hazard ratio 1.38 and 2.14), and significantly higher cumulative incidence of relapse (hazard ratio 1.64 and 2.76), compared to patients with very good, good or intermediate risk. When comparing the predictive performance of a series of Cox models both for relapse-free survival and for overall survival, a model with simplified 5-group cytogenetics (merging very good, good and intermediate cytogenetics) performed best. Furthermore, monosomal karyotype is an additional negative predictor for outcome within patients of the poor, but not the very poor risk group of the 5-group classification. The revised International Prognostic Scoring System cytogenetic classification allows patients with myelodysplastic syndromes to be separated into three groups with clearly different outcomes after stem cell transplantation. Poor and very poor risk cytogenetics were strong predictors of poor patient outcome. The new cytogenetic classification added value to prediction of patient outcome compared to prediction models using only traditional risk factors or the 3-group International Prognostic Scoring System cytogenetic classification.","['Koenecke, Christian', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'de Wreede, Liesbeth C', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'Scheid, Christof', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Schaap, Nicolaas', 'Robin, Marie', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Cornelissen, Jan', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Heuser, Michael', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Kroger, Nicolaus']","['Koenecke C', 'Gohring G', 'de Wreede LC', 'van Biezen A', 'Scheid C', 'Volin L', 'Maertens J', 'Finke J', 'Schaap N', 'Robin M', 'Passweg J', 'Cornelissen J', 'Beelen D', 'Heuser M', 'de Witte T', 'Kroger N']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Germany koenecke.christian@mh-hannover.de.', 'Institute of Cell and Molecular Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Statistics LUMC, Leiden, The Netherlands DKMS, German Bone Marrow Donor Center, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Statistics LUMC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'University of Cologne, Germany.', 'Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland.', 'University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'University of Freiburg, Germany.', 'Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France.', 'University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Erasmus MC-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'University Hospital, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Germany.', 'Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141231,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Europe', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', '*Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Societies, Medical', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC4349280,,2015/01/02 06:00,2015/10/01 06:00,['2015/01/02 06:00'],"['2015/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.116715 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.116715 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Mar;100(3):400-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.116715.

Despite this, precisely how endocytosis is regulated in a cell-type-specific manner and how this key pathway functions physiologically or pathophysiologically remain largely unknown. PICALM, which encodes the clathrin adaptor protein PICALM, was originally identified as a component of the CALM/AF10 leukemia oncogene. Here we show, by employing a series of conditional Picalm knockout mice, that PICALM critically regulates transferrin uptake in erythroid cells by functioning as a cell-type-specific regulator of transferrin receptor endocytosis. While transferrin receptor is essential for the development of all hematopoietic lineages, Picalm was dispensable for myeloid and B-lymphoid development. Furthermore, global Picalm inactivation in adult mice did not cause gross defects in mouse fitness, except for anemia and a coat color change. Freeze-etch electron microscopy of primary erythroblasts and live-cell imaging of murine embryonic fibroblasts revealed that Picalm function is required for efficient clathrin coat maturation. We showed that the PICALM PIP2 binding domain is necessary for transferrin receptor endocytosis in erythroblasts and absolutely essential for erythroid development from mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in an erythroid culture system. We further showed that Picalm deletion entirely abrogated the disease phenotype in a Jak2(V617F) knock-in murine model of polycythemia vera. Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of cell-type-specific transferrin receptor endocytosis in vivo. They also suggest a new strategy to block cellular uptake of transferrin-bound iron, with therapeutic potential for disorders characterized by inappropriate red blood cell production, such as polycythemia vera.","['Ishikawa, Yuichi', 'Maeda, Manami', 'Pasham, Mithun', 'Aguet, Francois', 'Tacheva-Grigorova, Silvia K', 'Masuda, Takeshi', 'Yi, Hai', 'Lee, Sung-Uk', 'Xu, Jian', 'Teruya-Feldstein, Julie', 'Ericsson, Maria', 'Mullally, Ann', 'Heuser, John', 'Kirchhausen, Tom', 'Maeda, Takahiro']","['Ishikawa Y', 'Maeda M', 'Pasham M', 'Aguet F', 'Tacheva-Grigorova SK', 'Masuda T', 'Yi H', 'Lee SU', 'Xu J', 'Teruya-Feldstein J', 'Ericsson M', 'Mullally A', 'Heuser J', 'Kirchhausen T', 'Maeda T']","[""Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan."", ""Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA Department of Pediatrics Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA Program in Cellular & Molecular Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, MA, USA."", 'Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA Department of Pediatrics Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA Program in Cellular & Molecular Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, MA, USA."", ""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Chengdu Military Region, Chengdu, China."", ""Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Children's Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', ""Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA Department of Pediatrics Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA Program in Cellular & Molecular Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, MA, USA."", ""Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, CA, USA Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA tmaeda@partners.org.""]",['eng'],"['K01 DK093543/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM075252/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 DK101665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141231,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Anemia, Hypochromic/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clathrin-Coated Vesicles/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endocytosis', 'Erythroblasts/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphopoiesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/chemistry/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Polycythemia Vera/*genetics/mortality', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism']",PMC4380716,,2015/01/02 06:00,2015/09/19 06:00,['2015/01/02 06:00'],"['2015/01/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.119537 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.119537 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Apr;100(4):439-51. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.119537.

While hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative therapeutic option for most patients, children with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia increasingly receive novel agents in phase I-II clinical trials as pre-transplant therapy or therapy for relapse after transplantation. However, response criteria or definitions of outcome for standardized evaluation of treatment effect in patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia are currently lacking. Here we propose criteria to evaluate the response to the non-transplant therapy and definitions of remission status after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. For the evaluation of non-transplant therapy, we defined 6 clinical variables (white blood cell count, platelet count, hematopoietic precursors and blasts in peripheral blood, bone marrow blast percentage, spleen size and extramedullary disease) and 3 genetic variables (cytogenetic, molecular and chimerism response) which serve to describe the heterogeneous picture of response to therapy in each individual case. It is hoped that these criteria will facilitate the comparison of results between clinical trials in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.","['Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Cseh, Annamaria',

PROCEDURE: Seven patients with osteosarcoma, treated in the Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group-trials, had a diagnosis of RTS. Their patient-, tumor- and treatment-related variables and outcome were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis of osteosarcoma was 13 years (range 7-16), five were female, two male. Tumor involved proximal tibia (n = 4), distal tibia (n = 1), distal fibula (n = 1) and proximal ulna (n = 1). Three patients had metastatic disease at diagnosis. All patients received surgery and chemotherapy. Four of seven patients required dose modifications and three of them terminated treatment prematurely. Complete resection of the primary tumor was achieved in all individuals. Two of three affected patients failed to achieve surgical clearance of their primary metastases and died. The third patient relapsed with multiple metastases and died. Two of four patients with localized disease were alive in first complete remission, a third patient in second complete remission after recurrence and a fourth patient died of acute leukemia, while still in first complete remission of osteosarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RTS and osteosarcoma may be cured of their cancer with appropriate multimodal therapy. They should be treated like other osteosarcoma patients but preexisting disorders, needs for special support and development of toxicities have to be considered.","['Zils, Katja', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Behnisch, Wolfgang', 'Mueller, Hermann L', 'Schlegel, Paul-Gerhardt', 'Fruehwald, Michael', 'Suttorp, Meinolf', 'Simon, Thorsten', 'Werner, Mathias', 'Bielack, Stefan']","['Zils K', 'Klingebiel T', 'Behnisch W', 'Mueller HL', 'Schlegel PG', 'Fruehwald M', 'Suttorp M', 'Simon T', 'Werner M', 'Bielack S']","['1Cooperative Osteosarcoma Study Group (COSS), Pediatrics 5 (Oncology, Hematology, Immunology), Klinikum Stuttgart-Olgahospital , Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141231,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Neoplasms/epidemiology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Osteosarcoma/epidemiology/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome/epidemiology/therapy']",,,2015/01/01 06:00,2016/01/09 06:00,['2015/01/01 06:00'],"['2015/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2014.987939 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2015 Feb;32(1):32-40. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2014.987939.

Recent studies have demonstrated that Pim-1 phosphorylates RUNX3 and alters its subcellular localization. However, few studies have concerned the implications of Pim-1 in the salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). In this study, we aimed to clarify the function of Pim-1 in ACC in vitro. Meanwhile, we measured the levels of Pim-1 and RUNX3 in the ACC tissues. The correlations between Pim-1/RUNX3 levels and clinical parameters were also analyzed. METHODS: SACC-83 and SACC-LM cells were transfected with the Pim-1 siRNA. Pim-1 mRNA and protein expression were measured using real-time PCR and immnuoblot, respectively. Cell proliferation was analyzed by CCK-8 assay. Cell cycle, apoptosis, and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by flow cytometry. Effects of Pim-1 on cells' invasion were evaluated by transwell migration assay. Pim-1 and RUNX3 levels in ACC tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Pim-1 siRNA reduces cell proliferation, induces apoptosis, causes cell cycle arrest through cell cycle related proteins (Cyclin D1 and CDK4), mitochondrial depolarization, and decreases invasive ability in SACC-83 and SACC-LM cells. Pim-1 and RUNX3 levels are significantly relevant and associated with T-stage and nerve invasion in the ACC tissues. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the oncogenic role of Pim-1 in ACC. The findings also suggest that Pim-1 may serve as a neoteric therapeutic target and potential prognostic marker for ACC cancer.","['Zhu, Xin', 'Xu, Jia-jie', 'Hu, Si-si', 'Feng, Jian-guo', 'Jiang, Lie-hao', 'Hou, Xiu-xiu', 'Cao, Jun', 'Han, Jing', 'Ling, Zhi-qiang', 'Ge, Ming-hua']","['Zhu X', 'Xu JJ', 'Hu SS', 'Feng JG', 'Jiang LH', 'Hou XX', 'Cao J', 'Han J', 'Ling ZQ', 'Ge MH']","['Zhejiang Cancer Research Institute, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, 310022, Hangzhou, China. xin-zx@163.com.', 'Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, 310022, Hangzhou, China. 03kqyxxjj@163.com.', 'Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, 310022, Hangzhou, China. p.sissi@163.com.', 'Zhejiang Cancer Research Institute, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, 310022, Hangzhou, China. fengjg@zjcc.org.cn.', 'Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, 310022, Hangzhou, China. jiangliehao@126.com.', 'Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, 310022, Hangzhou, China. show-1989@163.com.', 'Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, 310022, Hangzhou, China. caojunisbest@163.com.', 'Zhejiang Cancer Research Institute, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, 310022, Hangzhou, China. hjmengxiangzhilv@126.com.', 'Zhejiang Cancer Research Institute, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, 310022, Hangzhou, China. lingzq@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, 310022, Hangzhou, China. gemingh@163.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141231,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Adenoid Cystic/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit/genetics', 'Cyclin D1/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/genetics', 'Humans', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC4304190,,2015/01/01 06:00,2016/02/18 06:00,['2015/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-014-0114-5 [doi]', 's13046-014-0114-5 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2014 Dec 31;33:114. doi: 10.1186/s13046-014-0114-5.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Runx3 protein, human)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A comprehensive PubMed and Embase search was performed using the following keywords: ""reduced-intensity"", ""myeloablative"", ""AML"", and ""MDS"". The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS), and the secondary endpoints were relapse incidence (RI), non-relapse mortality (NRM), grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), and chronic GVHD (cGVHD). RESULTS: Eight studies (2 prospective and 6 retrospective) involving 6464 patients who received RIC (n = 1571) or MAC (n = 4893) alloHSCT were included in the analysis. Median age and the number of patients with low hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index scores and who received ex vivo or in vivo T cell depletion were higher in the RIC arm than in the MAC arm. Significant heterogeneity was not found among the studies for any of the endpoints except for grade II-IV aGVHD. OS (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-1.08; p = 0.47) and EFS (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77-1.00; p = 0.05) were similar in the RIC and MAC arms, whereas RI (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.24-1.59; p < 0.00001) was higher in the RIC arm than in the MAC arm. The incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36-0.96; p = 0.03) was lower in the RIC arm than in the MAC arm; however, NRM (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87-1.13; p = 0.85), total cGVHD (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.88-1.38; p = 0.38), and extensive cGVHD (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.75-1.37; p = 0.95) were not significantly different between the two arms. CONCLUSION: RIC alloHSCT may be an effective treatment strategy for AML/MDS patients who are not suitable candidates for MAC alloHSCT. However, heterogeneity in baseline patient characteristics and treatment protocols may have influenced the outcomes of RIC alloHSCT in our analysis. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm our findings.","['Zeng, Wen', 'Huang, Lifang', 'Meng, Fankai', 'Liu, Zeming', 'Zhou, Jianfeng', 'Sun, Hanying']","['Zeng W', 'Huang L', 'Meng F', 'Liu Z', 'Zhou J', 'Sun H']","['Department of Hematology, Tongji hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology 1095# Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology 1095# Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology 1095# Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Department of General surgery, Union hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology 1277# Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology 1095# Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology 1095# Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430030, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141115,United States,Int J Clin Exp Med,International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,101471010,,,PMC4276213,,2015/01/01 06:00,2015/01/01 06:01,['2015/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Med. 2014 Nov 15;7(11):4357-68. eCollection 2014.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Reduced-intensity conditioning', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'meta-analysis', 'myeloablative conditioning', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'systematic review']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Unbtreated K562 cells (CON), blank lentivirus transfected K562 cells (NC) and K562 cells expressing STAT3 siRNA (STAT3 siRNA) were injected into SCID mice to establish the chronic myeloid leukemia model in mice. The growth, peripheral white blood cell count and spleen index in these mice were determined. RESULTS: In vitro experiment showed, when compared with control group, the interference efficiency of STAT3 expression was as high as 97.5% in K562 cells. Western blot assay revealed that the expression of c-Myc, Bcl-xL and Cyclin D1 reduced by 17.01%, 7.3% and 6.82%, respectively, showing significant difference when compared with control group (P < 0.01). These findings were consistent with those from fluorescence quantitative PCR. In vivo experiment showed the body weight of mice reduced progressively and the peripheral white blood cell count increased gradually in control group, accompanied by dragging hind limbs and progressive enlargement of the spleen. The body weight remained unchanged, peripheral white blood cell count reduced gradually and the spleen did not enlarge in mice treated with STAT3 siRNA expressing cells. CONCLUSION: Lentivirus mediated STAT3 silencing may inhibit the expression of its downstream genes (c-Myc, Bcl-xL and Cyclin D1) related to cell proliferation, apoptosis and cycle to suppress the malignant biological behaviors, and STAT3 silencing also inhibit the leukemogenic potency of K562 cells in mice.","['Jia, Xinyan', 'Yang, Wenzhong', 'Han, Jia', 'Xiong, Hong']","['Jia X', 'Yang W', 'Han J', 'Xiong H']","['Department of Hematology, East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine Shanghai 200120, China.', 'Department of Hematology, East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine Shanghai 200120, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital & Shanghai Clinical Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai 200031, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital & Shanghai Clinical Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai 200031, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141115,United States,Int J Clin Exp Med,International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,101471010,,,PMC4276170,,2015/01/01 06:00,2015/01/01 06:01,['2015/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Med. 2014 Nov 15;7(11):4031-7. eCollection 2014.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'STAT3 siRNA', 'animal model', 'lentivirus']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no difference in clinical parameters between cases with miR-24 high expression and with miR-24 low expression. The frequency of miR-24 high expression was higher in patients with t(8;21) than in others (82% (9/11) versus 44% (32/72), P=0.026). The levels of miR-24 expression had no correlation with the mutations of nine genes (FLT3-ITD, NPM1, C-KIT, IDH1/IDH2, DNMT3A, N/K-RAS and C/EBPA).

The microfilament-disrupting agent inhibits cytokinesis, producing enlarged and multinucleated neoplastic cells without enlarging or producing multinucleated normal cells. In addition, cytochalasin B has been shown to induce apoptosis and to increase the mitochondrial activity of malignant cells. In spite of these pharmacological properties potentially exploitable in cancer chemotherapy, no cytochalasin congener or derivative and indeed no microfilament-directed agent has yet been examined in the clinic. Nevertheless, it will likely be necessary to combine microfilament-directed agents with other chemotherapeutic agents, and potentially with other anti-neoplastic modalities to amplify the mechanisms by which microfilament-directed agents inflict damage. These combinations could increase the likelihood of obtaining clinically useful activities with microfilament-directed agents and decrease the often inevitable emergence of drug resistance. Therefore, this study intends to determine appropriate chemotherapeutic agents to use concurrently with cytochalasin B and with other microfilament-directed agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since cytochalasin B has shown in vitro efficacy against anchorage-independent growth, as well as against attached malignancies, both U937 human monocytic leukemia and MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells were evaluated. These cell lines were assessed for their sensitivity to a comprehensive array of chemotherapeutic agents that could amplify the cytoskeletal effects of microfilament-directed agents or that could themselves be potentiated by the cellular effects of such agents. In addition, clinically-approved microtubule-directed agents, as well as clinically-active anti-neoplastic agents not specifically cytoskeletal-directed, were examined for their ability to potentiate cell enlargement, one of the hallmark features of microfilament-directed agents. Conditions for inducing optimal enlargement and multinucleation of neoplastic cells with cytochalasin B were also defined. RESULTS: U937 and MCF7 cells have differing sensitivities to chemotherapeutic agents indicating that different regimens will likely be needed for various cell types in concomitant cytochalasin B-mediated chemotherapy. It was noted that microtubule-directed agents (paclitaxel and vincristine) would likely have a synergistic effect with cytochalasin B as they produced a substantial enlargement in viable cells at their 50% inhibitory (IC50) values. Interestingly, doxorubicin and mitomycin C also produced considerable cell enlargement, suggesting that nucleic acid-directed agents may be used to further enhance the cell-enlargement and multinucleation effects of microfilament-directed agents if appropriate sequences and concentrations can be found for the combination of agents. A subsequent publication in this series will examine the optimal combinations of chemotherapeutic agents with microfilament-directed agents in regards to drug concentrations and sequential timing. U937 cells exposed to cytochalasin B exhibited substantial cell enlargement and multinucleation that was still prevalent 8 days post-administration depending on the concentration used. CONCLUSION: Taken together, it appears that cytochalasin B has substantial synergistic potential with microtubule- and nucleic acid-directed agents.","['Trendowski, Matthew', 'Wong, Victoria', 'Yu, Guowu', 'Fondy, Thomas P']","['Trendowski M', 'Wong V', 'Yu G', 'Fondy TP']","['Department of Biology, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, U.S.A. mrtrendo@syr.edu.', 'Department of Biology, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, U.S.A.', 'Department of Biology, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, U.S.A.', 'Department of Biology, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, U.S.A.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Enlargement/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Sound']",,,2015/01/01 06:00,2015/03/11 06:00,['2015/01/01 06:00'],"['2015/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['35/1/65 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2015 Jan;35(1):65-76.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chemotherapy', 'breast carcinoma', 'cell enlargement', 'cytochalasin B', 'cytoskeletal-directed agents', 'leukemia', 'nucleic acid-directed agents']","['Copyright(c) 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Many young CML patients encounter pregnancy during their lifetime. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors inhibit several proteins that are known to have important functions in gonadal development, implantation and fetal development, thus increasing the risk of embryo toxicities. Studies have shown imatinib to be embryotoxic in animals with varying effects in fertility. Since pregnancy is rare in CML, there are no randomized controlled trials to address the optimal management of this condition. However, there are several case reports and case series on CML in pregnancy. At the present time, there is no consensus on how to manage different pregnancy situations in CML.

One of the key players in the regulation of inositol lipid signaling is the phospholipase Cbeta1 (PI-PLCbeta1), that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtIns(4,5)P2], giving rise to the second messengers inositol triphosphate and diacylglicerol. PI-PLCbeta1 has been associated with the regulation of several cellular functions, some of which have not yet been fully understood. In particular, it has been reported that PI-PLCbeta1 protects murine fibroblasts from oxidative stress-induced cell death. The mediators of oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS), have been shown to regulate major epigenetic processes, causing the silencing of tumor suppressors and enhancing the proliferation of leukemic cells under oxidative stress. Investigation of the interplay between ROS, PI-PLCbeta1, and their signaling mediators in leukemia might therefore reveal innovative targets of pharmacological therapy in the treatment for leukemia. In this work, we demonstrate that in pro-B-lymphoblastic cells (Ba/F3), treated with H2O2, PI-PLCbeta1b conferred resistance to cell death, promoting cell cycle progression and cell proliferation and influencing the expression of cyclin A and E. Interestingly, we found that, expression of PI-PLCbeta1b affects the activity of caspase-3, caspase-7, and of several protein kinases induced by oxidative stress. In particular, PI-PLCbeta1b expression completely abolished the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 MAP kinases, down-regulated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and up-regulated the phosphorylation of Akt, thereby sustaining cellular proliferation.","['Piazzi, Manuela', 'Blalock, William L', 'Bavelloni, Alberto', 'Faenza, Irene', 'Raffini, Mirco', 'Tagliavini, Francesca', 'Manzoli, Lucia', 'Cocco, Lucio']","['Piazzi M', 'Blalock WL', 'Bavelloni A', 'Faenza I', 'Raffini M', 'Tagliavini F', 'Manzoli L', 'Cocco L']","['*Cell Signaling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Struttura Complessa Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Cell Biology, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy; Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council of Italy, Bologna, Italy; and RAMSES Laboratory, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy manuela.piazzi3@unibo.it manuela.piazzi@gmail.com.', '*Cell Signaling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Struttura Complessa Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Cell Biology, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy; Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council of Italy, Bologna, Italy; and RAMSES Laboratory, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.', '*Cell Signaling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Struttura Complessa Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Cell Biology, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy; Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council of Italy, Bologna, Italy; and RAMSES Laboratory, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.', '*Cell Signaling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Struttura Complessa Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Cell Biology, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy; Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council of Italy, Bologna, Italy; and RAMSES Laboratory, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.', '*Cell Signaling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Struttura Complessa Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Cell Biology, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy; Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council of Italy, Bologna, Italy; and RAMSES Laboratory, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.', '*Cell Signaling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Struttura Complessa Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Cell Biology, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy; Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council of Italy, Bologna, Italy; and RAMSES Laboratory, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.', '*Cell Signaling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Struttura Complessa Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Cell Biology, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy; Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council of Italy, Bologna, Italy; and RAMSES Laboratory, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.', '*Cell Signaling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; Struttura Complessa Laboratory of Musculoskeletal Cell Biology, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy; Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council of Italy, Bologna, Italy; and RAMSES Laboratory, Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141230,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cyclin A/metabolism', 'Cyclin E/*metabolism', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/toxicity', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phospholipase C beta/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2015/01/01 06:00,2015/06/24 06:00,['2015/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['fj.14-259051 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.14-259051 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2015 Apr;29(4):1383-94. doi: 10.1096/fj.14-259051.

We performed targeted mutational analysis of 194 patients with rigorously defined s-AML or t-AML and 105 unselected AML patients.

FLT3-ITD is significantly associated with a poor outcome, and offering an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is recommended for patients harboring this mutation. Sorafenib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor active against RAF, VEGF, and FLT3-ITD. It has been used in an off-label fashion in FLT3-ITD AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the successful use of sorafenib after allo-HCT in patients with FLT3-ITD AML. Six FLT3-ITD AML patients received sorafenib as posttransplantation maintenance therapy (n = 5) or as salvage therapy after a post-allo-HCT relapse (n = 1) and continued afterward. RESULTS: One patient developed myocardial infarction 100 days after initiation of sorafenib. Interestingly, skin graft versus host disease (grade II) was observed in 5 of 6 patients and generally occurred within few days after initiation of sorafenib, but it responded promptly to corticosteroid therapy in all patients. All 6 patients were alive and in complete remission at a median follow-up of 16 months (range, 10-29 months) since first induction and at a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 4-20 months) since initiation of sorafenib. Remarkably, the disease of all patients was in molecular remission. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib appears to be an effective maintenance therapy after allo-HCT in FLT3-ITD AML, with achievement of durable complete responses. This suggests an immunomodulatory effect of sorafenib in the posttransplantation setting and warrants a broader clinical evaluation of the use of maintenance sorafenib in FLT3-ITD AML.","['Antar, Ahmad', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Mahfouz, Rami', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Antar A', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Mahfouz R', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Internal Medicine/Hematology-Oncology, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation, H.

A robust feature selection algorithm is required to remove irrelevant genes and choose the informative ones. Support vector data description (SVDD) has been applied to gene selection for many years. However, SVDD cannot address the problems with multiple classes since it only considers the target class. In addition, it is time-consuming when applying SVDD to gene selection. This paper proposes a novel fast feature selection method based on multiple SVDD and applies it to multi-class microarray data. A recursive feature elimination (RFE) scheme is introduced to iteratively remove irrelevant features, so the proposed method is called multiple SVDD-RFE (MSVDD-RFE). To make full use of all classes for a given task, MSVDD-RFE independently selects a relevant gene subset for each class. The final selected gene subset is the union of these relevant gene subsets. The effectiveness and accuracy of MSVDD-RFE are validated by experiments on five publicly available microarray datasets. Our proposed method is faster and more effective than other methods.","['Cao, Jin', 'Zhang, Li', 'Wang, Bangjun', 'Li, Fanzhang', 'Yang, Jiwen']","['Cao J', 'Zhang L', 'Wang B', 'Li F', 'Yang J']","['School of Computer Science and Technology & Provincial Key Laboratory for Computer Information Processing Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu, China.', 'School of Computer Science and Technology & Provincial Key Laboratory for Computer Information Processing Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization, Nanjing 210000, Jiangsu, China.', 'School of Computer Science and Technology & Provincial Key Laboratory for Computer Information Processing Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu, China.', 'School of Computer Science and Technology & Provincial Key Laboratory for Computer Information Processing Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu, China.', 'School of Computer Science and Technology & Provincial Key Laboratory for Computer Information Processing Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, Jiangsu, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization, Nanjing 210000, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20141227,United States,J Biomed Inform,Journal of biomedical informatics,100970413,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Colonic Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/genetics', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods', 'Software', '*Support Vector Machine']",,,2015/01/01 06:00,2015/12/17 06:00,['2015/01/01 06:00'],"['2014/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S1532-0464(14)00274-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbi.2014.12.009 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomed Inform. 2015 Feb;53:381-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2014.12.009.

In this study, the tumor recognition ability of a natural killer cell-activating receptor, DNAM-1 was harnessed to design CARs that target multiple tumor types. DNAM-1 ligands, PVR and nectin-2, are expressed on primary human leukemia, myeloma, ovarian cancer, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and Ewing sarcoma. DNAM-1 CARs exhibit high tumor cell cytotoxicity but low IFN-gamma secretion in vitro. In contrast to other CAR designs, co-stimulatory domains did not improve the expression and function of DNAM-1 CARs. A DNAM-1/CD3zeta CAR reduced tumor burden in a murine melanoma model in vivo.

This study sought to establish rates of documentation of discussion of risk of infertility, fertility preservation (FP) options, and referrals to fertility specialists in AYA patients' medical records at four cancer centers. METHODS: All centers reviewed randomized records within the top four AYA disease sites (breast, leukemia/lymphoma, sarcoma, and testicular). Eligible records included those of patients: diagnosed in 2011, with no prior receipt of gonadotoxic therapy; age 18 to 45 years; with no multiple primary cancers; and for whom record was not second opinion. Quality Oncology Practice Initiative methods were used to evaluate documentation of discussion of risk of infertility, discussion of FP options, and referral to a fertility specialist. RESULTS: Of 231 records, 26% documented infertility risk discussion, 24% documented FP option discussion, and 13% documented referral to a fertility specialist. Records were less likely to contain evidence of infertility risk and FP option discussions for female patients (P = .030 and .004, respectively) and those with breast cancer (P = .021 and < .001, respectively). Records for Hispanic/Latino patients were less likely to contain evidence of infertility risk discussion (P = .037). Records were less likely to document infertility risk discussion, FP option discussion, and fertility specialist referral for patients age >/= 40 years (P < .001, < .001, and .002, respectively) and those who already had children (all P < .001). CONCLUSION: The overall rate of documentation of discussion of FP is low, and results show disparities among specific groups. Although greater numbers of discussions may be occurring, there is a need to create interventions to improve documentation.","['Quinn, Gwendolyn P', 'Block, Rebecca G', 'Clayman, Marla L', 'Kelvin, Joanne', 'Arvey, Sarah R', 'Lee, Ji-Hyun', 'Reinecke, Joyce', 'Sehovic, Ivana', 'Jacobsen, Paul B', 'Reed, Damon', 'Gonzalez, Luis', 'Vadaparampil, Susan T', 'Laronga, Christine', 'Lee, M Catherine', 'Pow-Sang, Julio', 'Eggly, Susan', 'Franklin, Anna', 'Shah, Bijal', 'Fulp, William J', 'Hayes-Lattin, Brandon']","['Quinn GP', 'Block RG', 'Clayman ML', 'Kelvin J', 'Arvey SR', 'Lee JH', 'Reinecke J', 'Sehovic I', 'Jacobsen PB', 'Reed D', 'Gonzalez L', 'Vadaparampil ST', 'Laronga C', 'Lee MC', 'Pow-Sang J', 'Eggly S', 'Franklin A', 'Shah B', 'Fulp WJ', 'Hayes-Lattin B']","['Moffitt Cancer Center;

There are three major mouse leukemia virus (MuLV) subgroups in laboratory mice: ecotropic, xenotropic, and polytropic. These MuLV subgroups differ in host range, pathogenicity, receptor usage and subspecies of origin. The MuLV ERVs are recent acquisitions in the mouse genome as demonstrated by the presence of many full-length nondefective MuLV ERVs that produce XRVs, the segregation of these MuLV subgroups into different house mouse subspecies, and by the positional polymorphism of these loci among inbred strains and individual wild mice. While some ecotropic and xenotropic ERVs can produce XRVs directly, others, especially the pathogenic polytropic ERVs, do so only after recombinations that can involve all three ERV subgroups. Here, I describe individual MuLV ERVs found in the laboratory mice, their origins and geographic distribution in wild mouse subspecies, their varying ability to produce infectious virus and the biological consequences of this expression.","['Kozak, Christine A']",['Kozak CA'],['. ckozak@niaid.nih.gov.'],['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",20141226,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,IM,"['Animals', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Topography, Medical']",PMC4306825,,2014/12/31 06:00,2015/09/01 06:00,['2014/12/31 06:00'],"['2014/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['v7010001 [pii]', '10.3390/v7010001 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2014 Dec 26;7(1):1-26. doi: 10.3390/v7010001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A paucity of data exists evaluating therapeutic drug monitoring and subsequent dose adjustment based on serum concentrations in humans. METHODS: An observational study was performed in 29 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia who initially received posaconazole oral suspension 200 mg 3 times daily and required >/=1 dose adjustment because of steady-state posaconazole serum concentration <0.7 mcg/mL. Four dosing schemas were compared simultaneously. Patient records were reviewed to collect patient-related and medication-related factors that may affect serum concentrations. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of patients experienced subtherapeutic posaconazole serum concentrations with prophylactic dosing of posaconazole oral suspension. Increasing the dose and/or schedule of posaconazole oral suspension led to attainment of goal posaconazole serum concentrations in all groups. However, patients who received 400 mg orally 3 times daily experienced the least significant increase in serum concentration and remained subtherapeutic, despite doubling the posaconazole daily dose. Toxicities were similar to baseline within all groups. Increasing the dose and/or frequency of posaconazole oral suspension led to an increase in systemic exposure and did not appreciably increase incidence of toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving posaconazole oral suspension that experience subtherapeutic posaconazole serum concentrations may benefit from increasing the frequency to 200 mg orally 4 times daily or dose to 300 mg orally 3 times daily.","['Hummert, Shelly E', 'Green, Myke R']","['Hummert SE', 'Green MR']","['*Division of Pharmacy Services, Providence St. Vincent Medical Center, Portland, Oregon; daggerDivision of Pharmacy Services, University of Arizona Medical Center; and double daggerSection of Hematology/Oncology, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/blood/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', '*Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Triazoles/*administration & dosage/*blood/therapeutic use']",,,2014/12/31 06:00,2016/05/14 06:00,['2014/12/31 06:00'],"['2014/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FTD.0000000000000175 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2015 Aug;37(4):508-11. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000175.,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This observation revolutionized drug development to target the oncogenic kinases implicated in various other malignancies, such as, EGFR, B-RAF, KIT and PDGFRs. However, one major drawback of anti-kinase therapies is the emergence of drug resistance mutations rendering the target to have reduced or lost affinity for the drug. Understanding the mechanisms employed by resistant variants not only helps in developing the next generation inhibitors but also gives impetus to clinical management using personalized medicine. We reported a retroviral vector based screening strategy to identify the spectrum of resistance conferring mutations in BCR/ABL, which has helped in developing the next generation BCR/ABL inhibitors. Using Ruxolitinib and JAK2 as a drug target pair, here we describe in vitro screening methods that utilizes the mouse BAF3 cells expressing the random mutation library of JAK2 kinase.","['Kesarwani, Meenu', 'Huber, Erika', 'Kincaid, Zachary', 'Azam, Mohammad']","['Kesarwani M', 'Huber E', 'Kincaid Z', 'Azam M']","[""Divisions of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Pathology, Cancer Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center."", ""Divisions of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Pathology, Cancer Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center."", ""Divisions of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Pathology, Cancer Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center."", ""Divisions of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Pathology, Cancer Blood Disease Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; mohammad.azam@cchmc.org.""]",['eng'],"['R01 CA155091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HL114074/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA155091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R21HL114074/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20141207,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nitriles', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines']",PMC4362691,['NIHMS663943'],2014/12/31 06:00,2016/08/06 06:00,['2014/12/31 06:00'],"['2014/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/51984 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2014 Dec 7;(94). doi: 10.3791/51984.,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was conducted to determine whether these two parameters are related. METHODS: A total of 204 cases of ALL were included in an analysis of blast immunophenotypic data. CD34 expression was categorized as low when less than 50% of blasts were CD34-positive (CD34(low)) and as high when 50% or more were CD34-positive (CD34(high)). RESULTS: Of 204 cases of ALL, 163 and 41 were of B-cell origin (B-ALL) and T-cell origin (T-ALL), respectively. Of all cases, 132 (64.7%) showed co-expression of MA and among these, 101 (76.51%) were CD34(high), while the remaining 31 (23.48%) were CD34(low). Of 72 cases without MA co-expression, 25 (34.72%) were CD34(high) and 47 (67.25%) were CD34(low). Furthermore, of 163 cases of B-ALL, 111 showed co-expression of MA and 84 of these were CD34(high). Of 52 cases of B-ALL without MA expression, 22 were CD34(high). Among 41 cases of T-ALL, 21 co-expressed MA, 17 of which were CD34(high). Moreover, all 20 cases of T-ALL without co-expression of MA were CD34(low). These differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: We observed a strong correlation between aberrant MA expression and CD34(high) expression on the blasts of ALL. We hypothesize that these different patient subsets may represent unique prognostic characteristics.","['Sharma, Rahul Kumar', 'Purohit, Abhishek', 'Somasundaram, Venkatesan', 'Mishra, Pravas Chandra', 'Kotru, Mrinalini', 'Ranjan, Ravi', 'Kumar, Sunil', 'Sazawal, Sudha', 'Pati, Hara Prasad', 'Tyagi, Seema', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Sharma RK', 'Purohit A', 'Somasundaram V', 'Mishra PC', 'Kotru M', 'Ranjan R', 'Kumar S', 'Sazawal S', 'Pati HP', 'Tyagi S', 'Saxena R']","['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20141223,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,PMC4278005,,2014/12/31 06:00,2014/12/31 06:01,['2014/12/31 06:00'],"['2014/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2014.49.4.241 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2014 Dec;49(4):241-5. doi: 10.5045/br.2014.49.4.241.

Most MDS patients are diagnosed in their late 60s to early 70s. The estimated incidence of MDS in the United States and in Europe are 4.3 and 1.8 per 100,000 individuals per year, respectively with lower rates reported in some Asian countries and less well estimated in other parts of the world. Evolution to acute myeloid leukemia can occur in 10-15% of MDS patients. Three drugs are currently approved for the treatment of patients with MDS: immunomodulatory agents (lenalidomide), and hypomethylating therapy [HMT (decitabine and 5-azacytidine)]. All patients will eventually lose their response to therapy, and the survival outcome of MDS patients is poor (median survival of 4.5 months) especially for patients who fail (refractory/relapsed) HMT. The only potential curative treatment for MDS is hematopoietic cell transplantation. Genomic/chromosomal instability and various mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis and prognosis of the disease. High throughput genetic technologies like single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis and next generation sequencing technologies have uncovered novel genetic alterations and increased our knowledge of MDS pathogenesis. We will review various genetic and non-genetic causes that are involved in the pathogenesis of MDS.","['Visconte, Valeria', 'Tiu, Ramon V', 'Rogers, Heesun J']","['Visconte V', 'Tiu RV', 'Rogers HJ']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA. ; Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20141223,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,PMC4278002,,2014/12/31 06:00,2014/12/31 06:01,['2014/12/31 06:00'],"['2014/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2014.49.4.216 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2014 Dec;49(4):216-27. doi: 10.5045/br.2014.49.4.216.

The MYST3/CREBBP AML tends to develop within 2 years of adjuvant chemotherapy, especially for breast cancer, without preceding myelodysplasia. It usually presents with disseminated intravascular coagulation and osteolytic lesions and has a poor prognosis despite aggressive resuscitation and therapy. With the increasing use of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, we are seeing a definite increase in the incidence of therapy related myelodysplastic syndromes and AML. One must keep this complication in mind while counseling and following up breast cancer patients who have received adjuvant chemotherapy.
