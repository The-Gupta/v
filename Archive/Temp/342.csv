Localisation: a. Plasmocytomas occur with approximately the same frequency in the spine and skull, but there is an exceptionally high incidence of multiple myelomas in the thoracic spine. Only in a few cases plasmocytomas of the skull lead to neurological symptoms; particularly when they are localised in the base of the skull. b. Lymphogranulomatosis affects only the thoracic vertebral column and leads less frequently to neurological complications compared with the multiple myelomas. c. Eosinophilic granulomas often attack the calvaria, but can also be found in the spine, the base of the cranium and the flat bones of the pelvis and the scapula. d. Leukaemias showed mainly intracerebral and intramedullary alterations: haemorrhages, leukaemic infiltrations and signs of degeneration. 2. CLINICAL FINDINGS: a. Whenever the calvarium was affected than repeated complaints of headaches prevailed and only very few neurological signs or symptoms were complained. b. Tumors in the base of the cranium caused eye symptoms and various cranial nerve palsies but less frequently increased intracranial pressure. c. Tumors localised in the region of the spinal cord caused early signs like root-irritations (intercoastal neuralgia), diffuse dorsal pain and/or lumbalgia. Symptoms of spinal compression generally of an ascending character then developed within a few weeks. d. Neurological symptoms were the first to manifest themselves in all cases of plasmocytoma in half of our patients with Hodgkin's disease. 3. History and course: a. Generally in the cases of cranial involvement the previous history was less than half a year (visible changes or clear cut symptoms). Spinal tumors on the average had longer histories as did other extra-medullar spinal new growth. Similar courses were seen in multiple myelomas and granulomas. b. Solitary plasmocytomas were very rare but seem to have a considerably better prognosis than in case of multiple occurrence.",,,,,

Presence of both lymphocyte-mediated graft rejection reactions and immuno suppression appears necessary for maximal virus activation and replication in vitro, although viruses can be activated by mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) alone in vitro. During HVGR, viruses are first detectable in lymph nodes draining the graft site, and later reach maximal titers in the spleen. Mice infected with murine leukemia virus (MuLV) as neonates or carrying MuLV secondary to milk transmission (carriers) also develop complex autoaggressive responses. By a sensitive in vitro microcytotoxicity assay, neoplastic or pre-neoplastic thymocytes from carrier mice were found to react vigorously against normal uninfected syngeneic embryonic fibroblasts, whereas they reacted much less vigorously with similarly prepared but MuLV-infected fibroblasts. Thymocytes from uninfected animals did not react with infected or uninfected fibroblasts. Peripheral lymphocytes from carriers reacted against MuLV infected fibroblasts, but not against uninfected fibroblasts, a pattern indistinguishable from deliberately-immunized mice. It is proposed that responses analogous to GVHR are also important in the pathogenesis of leukemia following exogenous leukemia virus infection.",,,,,

The assay employs isoelectric focusing in thin layer polyacrylamide gels to analyze microliter quantities of whole serum for the presence of a C/F factor protein and for deletions in a group of proteins called proteins B, C, and D (Fig, 1). A pH 5-10 gradient is used (Fig. 2) and each sample is screened using a serum volume which contains 300 micrograms immunoglobulin G (IgG). Individuals homozygous or heterozygous for C/F are distinguished from normal unaffected individuals on the basis of the presence of a C/F factor protein band (Table 1). Heterozygous carriers for C/F are distinguished from C/F homozygotes 75 percent of the time, on the basis of a deletion in either band B, C, or D (Table 2). On the basis of screening 65 patients with cystic fibrosis, 61 heterozygous carriers for C/F, and 105 normal control subjects, it was concluded that no obvious correlation existed between either sex, age, or severity of the disease in the individual C/F patient, and the absolute presence or absence of the C/F factor. In addition, no correlation existed between sex or age and the presence of the C/F factor or deletions in proteins B, C, and D in the individual heterozygous carrier for C/F or normal control subjects.

Purified 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase was homogeneous when tested in acrylamide and acrylamide SDS gel electrophoresis or in immunodiffusion. The enzyme was immunologically identical in red blood cells, blood platelets and normal leukocytes. The fixation of both substrates, NADP-+ and 6 phosphogluconate, seemed to proceed through a non ordered mechanism. NADPH was an inhibitor strictly competitive with respect to NADP-+ and non competitive with respect to 6 phosphogluconate. 2-3 Diphosphoglycerate seemed to be able to bind on both the fixation sites of NADP-+ and 6 phosphogluconate. The inhibition by ATP was competitive with 6 phosphogluconate and non competitive with NADP-+. 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase was inactivated by SH reagents and was partially protected against this inactivation by both substrates.

Immune evaluation during this period revealed multiple defects which were not present prior to transplantation, nor present in the transplant donor: diminution of lymphoid tissue, decline of all immunoglobulin subtypes, deletion of secretory immunoglobulin, disappearance of isohemagglutinins, loss of antibody to diptheria and tetanus toxoids, cessation of cutaneous hypersensitivity to mumps antigen, and inhibition of serum opsonizing activity. The patient was also unable to develop normal humoral or cellular reactivity to brucella antigen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, or dinitrochlorobenzene. This patient's course illustrates the severity and chronicity of immunoincompetence associated with allogeneic marrow grafting, the importance of early detection and rigorous treatment of infectious disease in these patients, and the need for improved immunologic reconstitution in human marrow transplantation.

The tropism of regressing Friend virus complex (RFV), which is conferred by its helper MuLV component, MuLV-RF, is different from that of the conventional virus strain, CFV. RFV is NB-tropic and CFV is N-tropic. Passage of nonregressing CFV through Fv-1 incompatible Swiss/ICR mice changed the tropism of CFV from N to NB and resulted in a virus strain which induced erythroleukemia that regressed. Passage of NB-tropic CFV back through Fv-1 compatible mice maintained NB-tropism and regression. Altering the quantity or type of helper MuLV in RFV complex by addition of Ri-MuLV inhibited regression in proportion to the amount of added Ri-MuLV. These studies indicate a relationship between a change in virus tropism to NB by passage in certain hosts (e.g., Swiss/ICR mice) and the ability of Friend virus to induce erythroleukemia that spontaneously regresses. MuLV-RF isolated from the RFV complex induced lymphocytic leukemia in newborn mice which regressed and caused the regression of CFV-induced erythroleukemia. MuLV-RF is NB-tropic, contains no spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) activity and helps SFFV form spleen foci in genetically restrictive mice. Pseudotype viruses were prepared, consisting of MuLV-RF, or other MuLV's, and SFFV derived from FV-B. The pseudotype viruses each acquired the tropism of the MuLV used in rescue.

The enzyme differs from other known DNA polymerases of mammalian type-C RNA tumor viruses by the following properties: 1. Its apparent molecular weight as estimated by velocity sedimentation data is 58,000 at 0.12 M KCl and 43,000 in the presence of 0.50 M KCl. 2. It has a Mg2+ optimum of 10 mM, and a Mn2+ optimum of 0.25 mM with (rA)n-(dT)10 as template. 3. At 50 mM KCl it is inhibited more than 70%, but it is not inhibited by phosphate ions at 2 mM.

Resistance was dependent on macrophage competence, but was relatively independent of T-lymphocyte competence. Although aging mice became progressively more deficient in functional T-cells, as demonstrated by a decreasing resistance to transplanted line Ib leukemia and by declining responses to T-cell nitogens (concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin), their resistance to HSV-1 increased with increasing age. Moreover, in mice that were made selectively deficient in T-cells by the combination of adult thymectomy and treatment with anti-thymocyte serum, resistance to HSV-1 did not correlate spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. However, selective reduction of macrophages by intraperitoneal injection of silica resulted in enhanced susceptibility to HSV-1. Furthermore, in vitro suppression of HSV-1 plaque formation in mouse embryo fibroblast cells was obtained by cocultivation of infected fibroblast monolayers with peritoneal macrophages, but not with splenic lymphocytes, from adult mice. Macrophages from weanling mice failed to suppress the development of plaques, indicating that the increase in resistance to HSV-1 with age is a result of increased macrophage competence.",,PMC414662,,,

As with other retroviruses, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) contains products of 3 major genes; the virus core gag gene products, the polymerase, and the virus envelope glycoprotein. When cells are transformed in vitro by the related feline sarcoma virus (FeSV), an additional protein, FOCMA is expressed at the cell membrane. FOCMA, which is FeSV-coded, is transformation and/or tumor specific and expressed regardless of whether or not the cells make virus or contain virus structural antigens. Lymphoid leukemia cells also express FOCMA, both when FeLV is used to induce the disease in laboratory cats and when the tumors occur under natural conditions. FOCMA is expressed on both T and B lymphoid leukemia cells, but not expressed on non-malignant lymphoid cells, even when they are infected with FeLV. About one-third of the naturally occurring lymphoid tumors of cats lack detectable FeLV proteins and varying portions of the FeLV provirus. Despite this, they regularly express FOCMA, which is the target of an immuno-surveillance response that functions effectively under most conditions. FOCMA thus provides a useful model for antigens that might be expressed in ""virus-negative"" leukemias of man.",86,,,,

A28S RNA species, of 5700 nucleotides, was identified as MC29- or MH2-specific. MC29 RNA shared 4 out of about 17 and MH2 RNA at least 1 out of 16 T1-oligonucleotides with several other avain tumor virus RNAs. In addition MC29 and MH2 RNAs shared 2 oligonucleotides which were not found in any other viral RNA tested. 60% of each 28S RNA could be hybridized by DNA complementary to other avian tumor virus RNAs (group-specific) but 40% could only be hybridized by homologous cDNA (specific). Src gene-related sequences of Rous sarcoma virus were not found in MC29 or MH2 RNA. The specific and group-specific sequences of MC29, defined in terms of their T1-oligonucleotides, were located on a map of all T1-oligonucleotides of viral RNA. Specific sequences mapped between 0,4 and 0,7 map units from the 3'poly(A) end and group-specific sequences mapped between 0 and 0,4 and 0,7 and 1 map units. The MC29-specific RNA segment was represented by 6 oligonucleotides, two of which were those shared only by MC29 and MH2 RNAs. In vitro translation of MC29 RNA generated a major 120 000 dalton protein and minor 56 000 and 37 000 dalton proteins. The 120 000 dalton protein shared sequences with the proteins of the avian tumor viral gag gene, which maps at the 5' end of independently replicating viruses. Since a gag gene-related oligonucleotide was also found near the 5' end of MC29 RNA, we propose that the 120 000 MC29 protein was translated from the 5' 60% of MC29 RNA. It would then include sequences of the defective gag gene as well as MC29-specific sequences. Since both MC29 and MH2 lack the src (sarcoma) gene of Rous sarcoma virusk it is concluded that they contain a distinct class of transforming (onc) genes. We propose that the specific sequences of MC29 and MH2 represent all, or part of, their onc genes because the onc genes of MC29 and MH2 are specific and represent the only known genetic function of these viruses. If this proposal is correct, the onc genes of MC29 and MH2 would be related, because the specific RNA sequence of MC29 shares 2 of 6 oligonucleotides with MH2. It would also follow that the 120 000 dalton MC29 protein is a probable onc gene product, because it is translated from MC29-specific (and group-specific) sequences and because both MC29- and MH2-transformed cells contain specific 120 000 and 100 000 dalton proteins, respectively.",,,,,

The kinetics of viral polypeptide synthesis were studied by pulse labeling with various isotopes (including (35)S and (32)P), followed by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with monospecific antisera to the major mouse mammary tumor virus gag and env proteins, p27 and gp52, respectively. Both the primary gag and env precursor polypeptides were synthesized in the GRSL cells, but their conversion into viral proteins was impaired. The major gag precursor, Pr73(gag), was stable over a period of 8 h, and mature viral core polypeptides could not be detected. Also, the highly phosphorylated intermediates in the proteolytic processing of Pr73(gag) in virus-producing cells were absent in GRSL cells.

The precursor for envelope proteins, Pr73(env), was turned over without the generation of mature viral envelope components gp52 and gp36.

By comparing more than 20 mapped oligonucleotides of CMII RNA with mapped and nonmapped oligonucleotides of acute leukemia viruses MC29 and MH2 and with mapped oligonucleotides of CMIIAV and other nondefective avian tumor viruses, three segments were distinguished in the oligonucleotide map of CMII RNA: (i) a 5' group-specific segment of 1.5 kb which was conserved among CMII, MC29, and MH2 and also homologous with gag-related oligonucleotides of CMIIAV and other helper viruses (hence, group specific); (ii) an internal segment of 2 kb which was conserved specifically among CMII, MC29, and MH2 and whose presence in CMII lends new support to the view that this class of genetic elements is essential for oncogenicity, because it was absent from an otherwise isogenic, nontransforming helper, CMIIAV; and (iii) a 3' group-specific segment of 2.5 kb which shared 13 of 14 oligonucleotides with CMIIAV and included env oligonucleotides of other nondefective viruses of the avian tumor virus group (hence, group specific). This segment and analogous map segments of MC29 and MH2 were not conserved at the level of shared oligonucleotides. CMII-transformed cells contained a nonstructural, gag gene-related protein of 90,000 daltons, distinguished by its size from 110,000-daltom MC29 and 100,000-dalton MH2 counterparts. The gag relatedness and similarity to the 110,000-dalton MC29 counterpart indicated that the 90,000-dalton CMII protein is translated from the 5' and internal segments of CMII RNA. The existence of conserved 5' and internal RNA segments and conserved nonstructural protein products in CMII, MC29, and MH2 indicates that these viruses belong to a related group, termed here the MC29 group. Viruses of the MC29 group differ from one another mainly in their 3' RNA segments and in minor variations of their conserved RNA segments as well as by strain-specific size markers of their gag-related proteins. Because (i) the conserved 5' gag-related and internal RNA segments and their gag-related, nonvirion protein products correlate with the conserved oncogenic spectra of the MC29 group of viruses and because (ii) the internal RNA sequences and nonvirion proteins are not found in nondefective viruses, we propose that the conserved RNA and protein elements are necessary for oncogenicity and probably are the onc gene products of the MC29 group of viruses.",,PMC353544,,,

Both types of particles were found to contain essentially the same major proteins of 76,000 (p76), 68,000 to 70,000 (p68-70), and 45,000 (p45) daltons, in addition to varying amounts of smaller proteins. The relative proportions of all these proteins varied from preparation to preparation in an unpredictable way. The p45, p68, and p70 proteins all contained sequences found in p76, suggesting precursor-product relationships of p76 leads to p70 leads to p45 for solid tumor A-type particles and p76 leads to p68 leads to p45 for extracellular myeloma-associated virus. In addition, immune precipitation experiments have established that p76 contains at least some of the antigenic determinants characteristic of murine leukemia virus p30. This confirms earlier nucleic acid hybridization studies which indicated a moderate degree of relatedness between MOPC-460 A-type particles and several standard murine leukemia and sarcoma viruses. Taken together, our results provide evidence supporting the concept that MOPC-460 A-type particles may represent aberrant forms of C-type murine viruses.",,PMC353533,,,

The sensitivity of the endogenous proviral DNA sequences to deoxyribonuclease I (DNaseI) was analysed in BALB-c mouse tissues (liver and spleen) and in the cell line JLS-V9 which does not produce virus. On all of these preparations the endogenous proviral DNA was as sensitive to DNase I digestion as total chromatin. Since the proviral genes in JLS-V9 cells were silent, it was of interest to study possible changes in the chromatin structure following virus induction by iododeoxyuridine. We could not detect any increase in the sensitivity of the endogenous proviral DNA to DNase I digestion following induction. The induction was very efficient, however, since 60% of the cells responded to produce intracellular virus antigens.",,,,,

Over 95% concordance was obtained between the ELISA and PM bioassays when meconia and whole-blood samples were tested. Moreover, three DCF(-) egg albumens from one virus shedder hen were positive by the direct ELISA. Complete agreement was found between a biological assay for endogenous virus and the ELISA when blood and albumens from inbred chickens were tested.

In contrast, the whole FL74 cell vaccine did not reduce the number of infected kittens that became persistently viremic. The live-virus vaccine was found to be both safe and efficacious. About a half of the kittens vaccinated with live virus had transient bone marrow infection that lasted from 2 to 4 weeks. Viral antigen was not detected in peripheral blood, and infective virus was not shed in saliva, urine, or feces during the period that the vaccinal virus could be recovered from the bone marrow.

Th. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75, 2011-2015]. In the present experiments the circumstances under which neoplastic lymphocytes that are transplanted in allogeneic animals retain, lose, or regain the capacity for dissemination or localization are assessed. Results indicate that the in vivo behavior of neoplastic lymphocytes is not a stable, irreversible characteristic that is transmitted to the cell progeny. On the contrary, it can be altered by the origin/tissue microenvironment in which the cells proliferate. It is suggested that, whereas neoplastic cell mutation followed by host selection could be responsible for changes in cell behavior, a more likely explanation is that the proliferating neoplastic lymphocytes acquire reversible nonmutational phenotypic characteristics during their interaction with the host microenvironment, which modify their behavior and, as a result, the prognosis of the neoplastic process.",,PMC411884,,,

This virus neutralization does not involve immunoglobulins or complement. After fractionation of the lipoproteins on the basis of particle size, flotation properties, and electrostatic charge, virus neutralizing activity is found primarily in the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (predominantly the chylomicrons) and in the HDL(2) subfraction of the high density lipoproteins. In fasted animals, activity resides chiefly in the high density lipoproteins. Neutralization titers increase strikingly during alimentary lipemia in both the lipoproteins of the rho < 1.006 g/cm(3) fraction and the high density lipoproteins. Increased activity persists in the high density lipoproteins after the lipemia recedes. Virus neutralizing activity is completely eliminated in all fractions by antiserum against high density lipoproteins and, in the triglyceride-rich fractions, by antiserum to murine apolipoprotein B. Complete removal of lipids markedly reduces the neutralizing activity of both classes of lipoproteins. Apolipoproteins delipidated with tetramethylurea retain some activity, which is enhanced by binding to a phospholipid-stabilized triglyceride emulsion and which is abolished by proteolytic digestion. We have demonstrated in vitro transfer of activity between high density and very low density lipoproteins of the mouse.

This RNA was mapped by heteroduplex methods using DNA probes from M-MuLV, the presumed parent of A-MuLV. The overall organization of the RNA was determined by using full-length M-MuLV reverse transcribed DNA and visualizing the heteroduplexes in the electron microscope. This showed that A-MuLV and M-MuLV have homologous sequences at both ends of their RNAs but that the central portion of the A-MuLV genome is not homologous to sequences in M-MuLV RNA. A precise measure of the lengths of the shared regions was obtained by using S1 nuclease to digest hybrids between 32P-labeled M-MuLV DNA and A-MuLV RNA; the resulting fragments were analyzed for their length by electrophoresis. The regions of homology were shown to be 1320 nucleotides long at the 5' end and 730 nucleotides long at the 3' end. Thus approximately 6200 nucleotides of the approximately 8300 in M-MuLV RNA were deleted when the A-MuLV genome was formed, but an insert of 3600 nucleotides, presumably derived from the normal murine genome, was inserted in place of the deleted region.",,,,,

However, no phagocytosis by unclassifiable leukemic blasts was observed, even though they had some submicroscopic characteristics of the monocytic series. These findings suggest that phagocytic capacity develops during the course of cell differentiation, becoming striking only when the blast cell acquires the ultrastructural features of the pro-monocytic stage. Using the myeloperoxidase reaction, this study also demonstrates a morphological alteration in the degranulation process after the ingestion of zymosan particles in both the blasts and the mature PMN cells of leukemic patients.

A second class of MuLV, termed mink cell focus-inducing virus (MCF), is produced specifically by preleukaemic and leukaemic AKR thymocytes. Nowinski et al. have established a series of tissue culture lines from AKR leukaemias and reported that the resulting cell lines produce virus particles, but that these particles, surprisingly, do not give rise to XC plaques. We have analysed the virus particles produced by one of these cell lines, termed AKRSL2.

These effects have been shown to be a general property of AEV and not of separate leukaemia- and sarcoma-inducing forms of the virus. AEV is defective for replication and can be propagated only in the prewence of helper virus. Its transformation specificity is independent of the helper virus used. It is not clear whether AEV has two different genes controlling transformation of the two types of target cell or whether it has only one gene coding for both.

This was demonstrated by interviral molecular hybridization between fractionated viral complementary DNA (cDNA) and RNA. cDNA near the 3' end (cDNA(3')) from a rat virus (RPL strain) was fractionated by size and mixed with mouse virus RNA (Rauscher leukemia virus). No hybridization occurred with total cDNA (cDNA(total)), in agreement with previous results, but a cross-reacting sequence was found with the fractionated cDNA(3'). The sequences between 50 to 400 nucleotides from the 3' terminus of heteropolymeric RNA were most hybridizable. The rat viral cDNA(3') hybridized with mouse virus RNA more extensively than with RNA of remotely related retroviruses. The related viral sequence of the rodent viruses (mouse and rat) showed as much divergence in heteroduplex thermal denaturation profiles as did the unique sequence DNA of these two rodents. This suggests that over a period of time, rodent viruses have preserved a sequence with changes correlated to phylogenetic distance of hosts. The cross-reacting sequence of replication-competent retroviruses was conserved even in the genome of the replication-defective sarcoma virus and was also located in these genomes near the 3' end of 30S RNA. A fraction of RD114 cDNA(3'), corresponding to the conserved region, cross-hybridized extensively with RNA of a baboon endogenous virus (M7). Fractions of similar size prepared from cDNA(3') of MPMV, a primate type D virus, hybridized with M7 RNA to a lesser extent. Hybridization was not observed between Mason-Pfizer monkey virus and M7 if total cDNA's were incubated with viral RNAs. The degree of cross-reaction of the shared sequence appeared to be influenced by viral ancestral relatedness and host cell phylogenetic relationships. Thus, the strikingly high extent of cross-reaction at the conserved region between rodent viruses and simian sarcoma virus and between baboon virus and RD114 virus may reflect ancestral relatedness of the viruses. Slight cross-reaction at the site between type B and C viruses of rodents (mouse mammary tumor virus and RPL virus, 58-2T) or type C and D viruses of primates (M7, RD114, and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus) may have arisen at the conserved region through a mechanism that depends more on the phylogenetic relatedness of the host cells than on the viral type or origin. Determining the sequence of the conserved region may help elucidate this mechanism. The conserved sequences in retroviruses described here may be an important functional unit for the life cycle of many retroviruses.",,PMC525941,,,

Major DNA species 8.4 and 5.0 kilobase pairs (kbp) long represent the linear, unintegrated proviruses of Snyder-Theilen feline leukemia virus and FeSV, respectively. Transfection experiments performed with electroeluted DNAs showed that the 8.4-kbp form led to the production of replicating nontransforming virus in mink and cat cells; in contrast, the 5.0-kbp DNA produced helper virus-independent foci of transformation in mouse NIH/3T3 cells and helper virus-dependent foci in mink cells at an efficiency comparable to that obtained with unfractionated extrachromosomal DNA. Sites of restriction endonuclease cleavage for six enzymes were oriented with respect to one another within the FeSV provirus. EcoRI recognized cleavage sites at 0.3 to 0.4 kbp from each terminus of FeSV DNA, reducing the 5.0-kbp DNA to molecules 4.3 kbp long; this enzyme excised a large internal proviral DNA fragment of corresponding size from the DNA of FeSV-transformed mink nonproducer cells. By using DNA transcripts complementary to different portions of the FeSV genome, sarcoma-specific sequences (the FeSV src gene) were positioned within 2.1 and 3.4 kbp from the 5' end of the proviral DNA with respect to the viral RNA genome. The src gene is flanked at both ends by sequences shared in common with feline leukemia virus.

The sequence relationships between the sarcoma viruses and their respective parental murine leukemia viruses (Kirsten and Moloney murine leukemia viruses), as well as between the two murine leukemia viruses, were also studied. The only observed nonhomology feature of the Kirsten murine leukemia virus/Moloney murine leukemia virus heteroduplexes was a substitution loop with two arms of equal length extending from 1.80 +/- 0.18 kilobases (kb) to 2.65 +/- 0.27 kb from the 3' end of the RNA. It is believed that this feature lies in the env gene region of the viral genomes. The Ha-SV and Moloney murine leukemia virus genomes (respective lengths, 6.0 and 9.0 kb) were homologous in a 1.0 +/- 0.05-kb region at the 3' end and possibly over a 200-nucleotide region at the 5' ends; otherwise, they were nonhomologous. Ha-SV and Ki-SV (length, 7.5 kb) were homologous in the first 4.36 +/- 0.37-kb region from the 3' end and in a 0.70 +/- 0.15-kb region at the 5' end. In between, there was a nonhomology region, possibly containing a short (0.23-kb) region of partial or total homology. The heteroduplex analysis between rat endogenous 30S RNA and Ki-SV shows that there are mixed regions of sequence homology and nonhomology at both the 5' and 3' ends. However, there is a large (4-kb) region of homology between Ki-SV and the rat 30S RNA in the center of the genomes, with only a small nonhomology hairpin feature. These studies help to define the regions of homology between the Ha-SV and Ki-SV genomes with each other and with the rat endogenous 30S RNA. These regions may be related to the sarcoma genicity of the viruses. In particular, the 0.7-kb region of homology of Ha-SV with Ki-SV at the 5' ends may be related to the formation of a 21,000-dalton phosphoprotein in cells transformed by either virus.",,PMC353503,,,

Using complementary DNA of LPD viral RNA, we found that the LPD viral genome is specifically and efficiently transcribed (2,500 copies per cell) in LPD tumor cells. Moreover, the LPD tumor cells contained newly inserted LPD viral information (5 to 10 copies per haploid genome), which was not present before the infection. From the absence of LPD virus-specific sequences in the normal cell genome of turkeys, it was concluded that the LPD virus is not an endogenous virus of turkeys.

The effector cells were susceptible to the treatment with anti-Thyl.2 plus complement, but were unrelated to natural killer cells (NK), because they could not lyse some target cells specific for M-MuLV in both the induction phase and the interaction between effector cells and target cells. Furthermore, a product of the env gene of M-MuLV, perhaps gp70, appeared to be responsible for this response, because viruses with recombinations in the env gene between ecotropic M-MuLV and a xenotropic virus failed to induce a response. When infectious M-MuLV was exposed to UV-light at different doses, the ability of UV-treated M-MuLV to induce a secondary cytotoxic response decreased in parallel with infectivity, indicating that infectivity was necessary for the induction of this response.",,PMC2185727,,,

The clinical course of a patient with acute myelomonocytic leukemia is described which was characterized by staphylococcal infections prior to therapy and again during a period of relapse. Neutropenia was not a feature of these two periods but in vitro studies revealed decreased bacterial killing capacity and decreased neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity. Infectious complications were not observed during drug-induced remission when bacterial killing capacity and myeloperoxidase activity were improved toward normal.

The particles were most common in lacunae of aging osteocytes and were only occasionally associated with osteoblasts. Although the morphology of budding and immature particles appeared to be identical with that of typical C-type viruses, most of the mature forms of particles showed atypical structure and size. The electron-dense core was very large and not clearly defined, measuring approximately 70-130 nm in diameter. This diffuse core sometimes completely filled the space within the envelope of the particles. The diameters of the pleomorphic mature C-type particles ranged from approximately 90 to 150 nm.

The effector cells proved to be theta-bearing T cells and the lysis of target cells was H-2 restricted. Data presented show that early viral protein synthesis but not viral DNA synthesis was necessary for the appearance of relevant antigenic determinant(s) on target cells. The results of co-capping experiments suggest that H-2 molecules may have close association with MCMV induced product(s) as also with murine leukemia virus glycoprotein (gp70) which is carried by normal L cells. Despite this observation, anti-H-2 serum effectively blocked the cytolysis whereas anti-gp70 and anti-MCMV sera failed. Anti-MCMV serum was effective in blocking cytolysis, only if the L cells were infected for 24 hours and then used as targets. MCMV infected L cells which were coated externally with inactivated Sendai virus could be effectively recognised by MCMV as also by sendai specific CTL. That the cytotoxicity exerted on such targets was of specific nature was revealed by the results of competitive blocking experiments with unlabelled targets.",,,,,

Absorption tests with appropriate tissues and direct cytotoxic tests with bone marrow CFU-S from several mouse strains confirmed that the sensitivity of BALB/c CFU-S to lysis by anti-Abelson-antigen antisera was due to expression of Abelson antigen. Spleen or bone marrow from BALB/c mice undergoing hematopoietic regeneration amplified Abelson antigen expression, although no expression of Abelson antigen was observed on regenerating C57BL/B6 bone marrow or spleen.

The hybrids, (B6-G(IX) (+) x 129)F(1) (G(IX) (+)F(1)) and (B6 x 129-G(IX) (-))F(1) (G(IX) (-)F(1)), differ only in regard to genetic loci controlling G(IX) antigen expression.

G(IX) (-)F(1) mice and mice of the two parental strains (B6-G(IX) (+) and 129) of G(IX) (+)F(1) do not produce G(IX) antibody and seldom show signs of these diseases. G((ERLD)), and G((RADA1)), antibodies, natural thymocytotoxic autoantibody, and antinuclear antibodies were produced by G(IX) (+)F(1) mice. However, these four antibodies were also found in the other strains. G(IX) (+)F(1) mice develop pronounced diffuse glomerulonephritis similar to that found in systemic lupus erythematosus in man. Incidence studies in which mice were examined according to age rather than state of health showed that the lesions occurred in 38% of G(IX) (+)F(1) mice but not in G(IX) (-)F(1), B6-G(IX) (+), or 129 mice.

From these results, the following conclusions are drawn: (i) Severe glomerulonephritis and the increased occurrence of lymphoproliferative lesions in these animals depend on the presence of G(IX) antigen; (ii) besides genes controlling G(IX) antigen expression, other genes from both parental strains are required to create the basis in the progeny F(1) mice for the development of these diseases; and (iii) the chronic production of G(IX) antibody may be necessary for the development of the severe glomerulonephritis and for the increased occurrence of lymphoproliferative diseases in G(IX) (+)F(1) mice.",,PMC413127,,,

The 5.5-kb species was identified as AEV RNA because (i) it was absent from non-transforming AEAV isolated from the same virus complex, (ii) it was present in complexes of AEV and different helper viruses, and (iii) its structure is similar to that of avian acute leukemia viruses of the MC29 group. Molecular hybridization indicated that 54% of AEV RNA is specific and 46% is related to other viruses of the avian tumor virus group, particularly to AEAV, therefore termed group-specific. The genetic structure of AEV RNA was deduced by mapping oligonucleotides representing specific and group-specific sequences and by comparing the resulting map to maps of AEAV and of other avian tumor viruses derived previously. AEV RNA contains a gag gene-related, 5' group-specific section of 1 kb, an internal AEV-specific section of 3 kb unrelated to any other viral RNA tested, and a 3' group-specific section of 1.5 kb. The 5' section of AEV RNA is closely related to analogous 5' sections of the MC29 group viruses and is homologous with a 5' RNA section that is part of the gag gene of AEAV. The 3' section is also shared with AEAV RNA and includes a variant C-oligonucleotide near the 3' end that is different from the highly conserved counterparts of all other exogenous avian tumor viruses. By analogy with Rous sarcoma virus and the acute leukemia viruses of the MC29 group, the internal specific section of AEV RNA is thought to signal a third class of onc genes in avian tumor viruses. Comparisons with AEAV and the MC29 group viruses suggest that both the 5' gag-related and the internal specific RNA sections of AEV are necessary for onc gene function.",,PMC413071,,,

Provirus integration, therefore, does not take place at random locations in the host genome, but in a specific class of DNA segments. Hybridization of cDNA synthesized on viral RNA to EcoRI and Xba I restriction fragments of the DNA from infected cells showed that: (i) only one copy of proviral DNA is integrated per haploid genome; (ii) different restriction patterns were found in the proviral DNAs present in the genomes of different animals, providing evidence for the existence of several strains or mutants; and (iii) different integration sites for the proviral DNA were found in the genome of different animals and of different infected cells in the same animal.

The abiquitous presence of endogenous viral genes among vertebrate species and the association of their expression with development of the haematopoietic system in the mouse have led to the proposal that these genes are involved in ontogeny. In addition, the genes may be implicated in oncogenesis as in the case of the AKR mouse in which a high incidence of spontaneous leukaemia is associated with the expression of endogenous murine laukaemia virus genomes. We report here the production of a fertile rooster which lacks avian leukosis virus-related endogenous viral genes and which seems to be completely normal and healthy. Thus, endogenous viral genes are apparently not essential for the normal development of the chicken.

Four different glycopeptide size classes, designated G(1), G(2), G(3), and G(4), with molecular weights of approximately 5,100, 2,900, 2,200, and 1,500, respectively, were shown to be associated with Rauscher MuLV virions grown in JLS-V9 cells. Various sugar precursors, including glucosamine, galactose, fucose, and mannose were incorporated into G(1) and G(2), suggesting that these are complex (type I) glycopeptides. The two smaller glycopeptide size classes, G(3) and G(4), were shown to be mannoserich (type II) glycopeptides. G(4) was more sensitive to digestion with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H than G(3), suggesting that the core of G(3) may contain fewer mannose residues. Glycopeptides of the same size class as G(1) and G(2) were associated with both Rauscher MuLV and AKR-MuLV grown in III6A (mouse embryo) cells. Previous studies have shown that gp52, a proteolytic cleavage product of gp70, possessed primarily G(1) glycopeptides and that gp52 was more highly sulfated than gp70. We observed that G(1) is approximately twofold more highly sulfated than G(2), explaining the observed difference in sulfation of gp52. The unusually large size of G(1) suggested that infection with MuLV may alter the host cell glycosylation pattern. To test this possibility, glycopeptides from Sindbis virions grown in uninfected and Rauscher MuLV-infected JLS-V9 cells were compared, and no differences were observed. G(1) was not detected in Sindbis virions, indicating that acquisition of G(1) depends on properties of the virus-coded polypeptide backbone of the gp70 molecule.",,PMC353415,,,

The transformed cells were found to display three distinct phenotypes of differentiation. First, cells transformed by AEV resemble erythroblasts. They express heme, globin, carbonic anhydrase and erythrocyte cell surface antigen at low levels, and histone H5 and erythroblast cell surface antigen at high levels. Second, cells transformed by MC29, CMII, OK10 and MH2 viruses have macrophage-like properties. They strongly express Fc receptors, phagocytic capacity and macrophage cell surface antigen, but only weakly express myeloblast cell surface antigen and are negative for ATPase activity. Third, cells transformed by AMV and E26 viruses resemble myeloblasts in that they weakly express Fc receptors, phagocytic capacity and macrophage cell surface antigen but strongly express myeloblast cell surface antigen and ATPase activity. No difference was found between in vitro- and in vivo-transformed cells in the parameters tested. In light of recent genetic and biochemical evidence, we believe that these phenotypes reflect the action of three new types of viral-transforming genes, designated erb (erythroblast), mac (macrophage) and myb (myeloblast).",,,,,

To learn more about this cell, a detailed ultrastructural analysis was performed. Fifty electronmicrographs of lymphoblasts from an untreated patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with numerous hand-mirror cells in the bone marrow were compared with 60 electronmicrographs of lymphoblasts from six patients with classic acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The unique qualitative ultrastructural features of the hand-mirror cells were the presence of undamaged mitochondria and uropods (handles) with terminal microspikes containing circular organized arrangement of 50-A microfilaments. Quantitative differences between hand-mirror cells and lymphoblasts were observed in nuclear perimeters (P less than 0.0001), nuclear lengths (P less than 0.001), cytoplasmic lengths (P less than 0.0002), nuclear-cytoplasmic length ratios (P less than 0.0001), and numbers of mitochondria (P less than 0.002). These findings indicate that hand-mirror cells contain ultrastructural components that are related to cell motility and the immunologic process. These results are significant in that the hand-mirror cells may be associated with an immunologic mechanism that is involved in leukemogenesis.",,,,,

These viruses have been studied for their effect on the viability, multiplication, and differentiation of normal bone marrow cells either with or without the addition of MGI. Virus from leukemic clones that can differentiate normally to mature macrophages and granulocytes (MGI+D+ clones) induced some multiplication of myeloblasts in the bone marrow, but the cells did not differentiate without adding MGI. In the presence of MGI, this virus then induced an increased number of colonies whose cells differentiated to mature macrophages or granulocytes as in colonies of uninfected cells. Virus infection also resulted in a decrease in the amount of MGI and fetal calf serum that was required for colony formation. Virus from MGI+D+ clones, in the presence of MGI, was 500-fold more effective in increasing colony formation than virus from the differentiation-defective MGI-D- clones, although both types of virus replicated with equal efficiency in the normal bone marrow cells. No such increase was obtained after infection with the Friend leukemic virus complex or the Moloney murine leukemia virus. Infection with virus from a MGI+D+ clone that was differentiated by MGI mainly to macrophages induced a higher percentage of macrophage colonies than virus from MGI+D+ clones that were differentiated by MGI to granulocytes and macrophages. Studies with isolated myeloblast colony-forming cells from the bone marrow have indicated that these are the target cells for the virus. Infections of these isolated myeloblasts with virus from MGI+D+ clones induced some multiplication without differentiation in the absence of MGI, and increased the viability and multiplication of the myeloblasts without inhibiting their ability to differentiate in the presence of MGI. The results, therefore, indicate that virus from MGI+D+ cells can increase the viability and multiplication of normal myeloblasts in the bone marrow without blocking the ability of these cells to be induced to differentiate by MGI, and that this effect was directly related to the competence of the leukemic host cells to be induced for normal differentiation. It is suggested that the difference between the effect of virus from MGI+D+ and MGI-D- cells may be due to a difference in their integration sites in relation to the genes that control cell viability, multiplication, and differentiation.",,PMC383823,,,

However, among 24 patients tested, the cell lines of only 11 showed statistically significant increases in T-antigen expression. A cell line from a patient with concurrent DS and acute myelogenous leukemia had a normal value. T-antigen expression did not correlate with the percentage of cells trisomic for chromosome 21 in 18 cell lines examined or with the number of copies of this chromosome in disomic and trisomic cell strains cloned from three mosaic patients.Collectively, cell lines from parents of trisomy 21 patients also showed increased susceptibility to SV40 infection; however, in five families tested, a consistent pattern of genetic transmission of elevated T-antigen expression from parent to offspring was not observed.

The electrophoretic patterns of purified virion proteins and hybridization of viral RNAs with virus-specific DNA suggest that these clones are two closely related variants, not unrelated viruses. Furthermore, in mice infected with these two clones, viral RNA appears in thymuses and spleens at the same time after infection and at nearly the same concentrations.

The major envelope subunit obtained was a large (apparent molecular weight of 450,000 to 500,000), glycosylated complex, composed of four to six gp70-p15(E) subunits. This complex was detected over a 100-fold range of cross-linker concentration and thus seems to represent a particularly stable viral substructure.

Hexosemonophosphate shunt activity rises concomitantly. Ingestin of paraffin oil droplets opsonized with complement or Ig increases 10-fold over 9 d in DMSO. Latex ingestion per cell by each morphologic type does not change significantly, but total latex ingestion by groups of cells increases with the rise in the proportion of mature cells with greater ingestion capacities. Degranulation, as measured by release of beta-glucuronidase, lysozyme, and peroxidase, reaches maximum after 3-6 d in DMSO, then declines. HL-60 cells contain no detectable lactoferrin, suggesting that their secondary granules are absent or defective. However, they kill staphylococci by day 6 in DMSO. Morphologically immature cells (days 1-3 in DMSO) are capable of O(2-) generation, hexosemonophosphate shunt activity, ingestion, degranulation, and bacterial killing.

On the other hand, the available information indicates that the genetic factors controlling the development of PL are frequently independent of those controlling the development of lymphosarcoma. There is no evidence that clinically normal cattle with PL harbor malignant cells or have any other clinical abnormality. In these animals lymphocytosis results from the expansion of two distinct subpopulations of non-neoplastic B lymphocytes, one of which is free of BLV. Long-term studies have shown that the large majority of cattle with PL do not develop lymphosarcoma even when kept to advanced age. These data indicate that PL is not a disease nor a preclinical stage of lymphosarcoma. Rather PL should be considered as a benign response to BLV infection which, although frequently associated with lymphosarcoma, is independant of it.",39,,,,

The EPI procedure revealed to be more sensitive than two other routine serological techniques, complement fixation and immunodiffusion. In addition, at the individual level the average EPI titers of the sera increase progressively from normal to hematologically-suspect, -- positive and finally to lymphosarcomatous animals; when the age is considered, there is a very significant increase of the amount of EP inhibiting antibodies among lymphocytotic animals, while there is only a very moderate increase of the EPI titer among hematologically normal contact animals. This suggests a loss of control of BLV expression in most lymphocytotic animals and may explain the more frequent occurrence of lymphosarcomas in this category of animals.

Tanned sheep red blood cells were exposed to p24 and GP antigens, separately and together. The GP antigen did not attach to the sheep red blood cells, while the p24 antigen did. On testing 150 samples from suspect animals with the crude antigen-coated sheep red blood cells, the indirect hemagglutination test detected almost the same number (74) of positive animals as the agar gel immunodiffusion test with GP antigen (79), and by each of these test a far greater number of cases of leukosis were detected than by hematologic examination (58) or agar gel immunodiffusion test with p24 antigen (44).

Moreover, its results can be read two days earlier, and an impression of the antibody level in the sera is obtained. In routine or large-scale work the indirect hemagglutination test is too troublesome and time-consuming compared to the agar gel immunodiffusion test.

Highly sensitive radio immuno assays were developed for detection of these proteins. Serum MPO was increased in 12/35 and decreased in 2/35 patients without correlation to WBC or neutrophil counts; these levels may reflect an abnormal production by leukaemic blasts or ineffective granulopoiesis in the bone marrow. Serum elastase was increased in 6/22 patients. Serum lactoferrin was decreased in 12/25 patients without correlation to neutrophil counts probably reflecting abnormal production. Serum elastase and MPO showed a covariation in chronic myeloid leukaemia but not in AML; the latter finding may indicate that the synthesis of these two proteins is not synchronized in AML-cells. Sequential studies of patients with AML demonstrated fluctuations of serum MPO and lactoferrin during remission most likely because of chemotherapeutic pertubation. Although a limited number of patients has been studied it is suggested that serum lactoferrin may be of help for prediction of relapse in AML.",,,,,

The amount of free virus in culture supernatants is strongly decreased while intracellular protein p30 stays unchanged or is slightly increased.

In autoradiographs of blood cell smears taken for 25 days or more after the beginning of 3H-thymidine administration the labeling index and the labeling intensity of granulocytes were determined. A sufficiently high labeling intensity, i.e. a sufficiently long autoradiographic exposure time was found to be critical for obtaining valid and reproducible results. On the basis of certain assumptions discussed in detail, complete labeling of cells with 3H-thymidine followed by autoradiographic evaluation and mathematical analysis of the labeling patterns seems to be a suitable method for estimation of kinetic parameters of postmitotic granulocytes in vivo. The mean intramedullary maturation and storage time was observed to be 115 +/- 7 h or neutrophils, 103 +/- 4 h for eosinophils and 103 +/- 11 h for basophils. The mean relative inflow rate into the blood (or relative turnover rate in the blood) was found to be 4.2 +/- 0.4/h for neutrophils, 4.0 +/- 0.4%/h for eosinophils and 1.2 +/- 0.3%/h for basophils. The mean blood transit time (or blood sojourn time) was estimated to be 25 +/- 2 h or neutrophils, 26 +/- 3 h for eosinophils and 89 +/- 21 h for basophils. Accordingly the half lifes (T 1/2) of granulocytes in the blood were 17.3 +/- 1.4 h for neutrophils, 18.0 +/- 2.1 for eosinophils and 62 +/- 15 h for basophils. Under the quasi steady state conditions of this study the kinetics of granulocytes in the present CLL patients appeared to be normal, despite a marked lymphocytic infiltration of the bone marrow. The apparent discrepancy between these findings and the data obtained with autotransfusion of DFP-labeled granulocytes is discussed.",,,,,

During the differentiation process, DMSO stimulated PGE synthesis by an average of 95%. The addition of a long-acting synthetic analogue of PGE2,16,16-dimethyl-PGE2-methyl ester (di-M-PGE2) to the culture medium only slightly and temporarily slowed cell growth, with no appreciable induction of differentiation. However, in the presence of DMSO, the same concentration of di-M-PGE2 produced 73% inhibition of cell growth and accelerated and potently stimulated haemoglobin production. The action of both di-M-PGE2 and DMSO on cell proliferation was dependent upon the state of cell growth at the time of the administration of these compounds. FLC cultures treated with DMSO + di-M-PGE2 produced considerable amounts of haemoglobin before even one duplication cycle was completed. Both DMSO and di-M-PGE2 stimulated endogenous PGE biosynthesis, and the biosynthetic effect of these compounds was synergistic. Inhibition of endogenous prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin completely abolished the effects produced by DMSO + di-M-PGE2 on the growth, and substantially reduced the stimulated differentiation of FLC. These data suggest that an endogenously synthesized prostaglandin plays a significant role in both the inhibition of replication and in the stimulation of differentiation induced by DMSO and di-M-PGE2 in Friend erythroleukaemia cells.",,PMC2009887,,,

The endogenous virus Rous associated virus O (RAV-O) was used as a helper for MC-29, and its genome was compared by fingerprinting to that of the original RAV-O. In three separate isolates, it was found that the RAV-O used as helper for MC-29 had acquired new sequences near the 3' and 5' ends of its genome. The new 3' proximal sequences resembled the C region found in exogenous but not endogenous avian oncoviruses, and it probably imparted a higher growth rate to the recombinant as compared to RAV-O. One isolate also showed recombination within the env gene. Because we could exclude the possibility that the recombination was with host cell information or with the original helper of MC-29, we conclude that the acquired sequences were derived from the MC-29 genome, and therefore this replication defective virus is not defective in recombination.",,PMC383739,,,

It was found that BLV p24 shares the common NH2-terminal proline and COOH-terminal leucine but lacks the common prolylleucylarginine tripeptide and the larger conserved region found near the NH2 terminus of all mammalian type C viral p30s. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of BLV p24 with the previously determined sequence of feline leukemia virus p27 revealed a statistically significant sequence homology.

It is suggested that if viral deoxyribonucleic acid, directly or via ribonucleic acid directed deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase activity becomes inserted at particular euchromatin - heterochromatin junctions of quasidifferentiated stem-like cells, then deheterochromatization may result, causing in turn derepression of genes for acidic protein phosphokinases. This sets into motion a series of events including altered acid protein repressors of embryonic genes which are repressed by uniquely weak type repressors. This explains how viruses can act as specific embryonic gene-inducing agents similar to chemical inducing agents such as the hepatocarcinogen ethinine.",,,,,

Reextraction of the viruses from spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus gland indicated the specific organotropism of each agent. All the adherent cell lines that were derived from hematopoietic tissues produced ample, potent RCN-inducing virus.

The method employs labeled membrane antigens that are isolated immunospecifically and subjected to limited trypsin digestion followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in detergent. A large ""core"" peptide is produced by proteolysis of murine thymus-leukemia antigens (TLA) and from antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The tryptic cores from H-2K and H-2D are regularly distinguishable from the thymus-leukemia antigens (TLA) by gel electrophoresis in one dimension. This chemical distinction is particularly important in the analysis of antigen mixtures isolated with antisera specific for beta 2 microglobulin. These techniques have been used to identify thymus-restricted beta 2 microglobulin-associated antigens on cell membranes from mouse, man, guinea pig, and monkey. In appropriate inbred mouse strains, these are the TLA and it is proposed that in the three other species examined they may be analogues, although not necessarily homologues, of TLA. The broad species distribution of these thymus-restricted cell membrane antigens suggests that they are involved in the differentiation of thymus-dependent lymphocytes (T cells).",,,,,

To more directly define platelet-PG interactions, a binding assay has been developed for platelet PG receptors with [(3)H]PGD(2) as ligand. [(3)H]PGD(2) binding to intact platelets was saturable and rapid with the ligand bound by 3 min at 20 degrees C. PG competed with the [(3)H]PGD(2) binding site with a potency series: PGD(2) (IC(50) = 0.08 muM) >> PGI(2) (IC(50) = 2 muM) > PGE(1) (IC(50) = 6 muM) > PGF(2alpha) (IC(50) = 8 muM). Scatchard analysis of binding data from six normal subjects showed a single class of binding sites with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 53 nM and 210 binding sites per platelet. This PGD(2) receptor assay was then used to study platelets from five patients with myeloproliferative disorders (polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia), as over 90% of these patients have platelets resistant to the effects of PGD(2) on aggregation and adenylate cyclase activity (1978. Blood.52: 618-626.). In the presence of 50 nM [(3)H]PGD(2), the patients' platelets bound 7.1+/-2.9 fmol ligand/10(8) platelets compared with 15.1+/-1 fmol/10(8) platelets in normals, a decrease of 53% (P < 0.01). Scatchard analysis showed that the K(d) of [(3)H]PGD(2) binding (33 nM) was comparable to normal platelets, which indicates that the decreased PGD(2) binding in these platelets represented fewer receptors rather than altered affinity of the ligand for the binding site. The 53% decrease in [(3)H]PGD(2) binding correlated with a 48% decrease in PGD(2)-activated platelet adenylate cyclase. The characterization of the platelet PGD(2) binding site provides further direct evidence that there are at least two PG receptors on platelets, one for PGE(1) and PGI(2), and a separate receptor for PGD(2). Direct binding analysis will be a useful tool for studying the role of PG in regulating platelet function, as demonstrated by the selective loss of PGD(2) binding sites in patients with myeloproliferative disorders.",,PMC372154,,,

This mutant, AU-100, was isolated from a mutagenized population of S49 cells by virtue of its resistance to 0.1 mM 6-azauridine in semisolid agarose. The AU-100 cells are resistant to adenosine mediated cytotoxicity but are extraordinarily sensitive to killing by guanosine. High performance liquid chromatography of AU-100 cell extracts has demonstrated that intracellular levels of GTP, IMP, and GMP are all elevated about 3-fold over those levels found in wild type cells. The AU-100 cells also contain an elevated intracellular level of pyrophosphoribosylphosphate (PPriboseP), which as in wild type cells is diminished by incubation of AU-100 cells with adenosine. However AU-100 cells synthesize purines de novo at a rate less than 35% of that found in wild type cells. In other growth rate experiments, the AU-100 cell line was shown to be resistant to 6-thioguanine and 6-mercaptopurine. Levels of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) measured in AU-100 cell extracts, however, are 50-66% greater than those levels of HGPRTase found in wild type cell extracts. Nevertheless this mutant S49 cell line cannot efficiently incorporate labeled hypoxanthine into nucleotides since the salvage enzyme HGPRTase is inhibited in vivo. The AU-100 cell line was found to be 80% deficient in adenylosuccinate synthetase, but these cells are not auxotrophic for adenosine or other purines. The significant alterations in the control of purine de novo and salvage metabolism caused by the defect in adenylosuccinate synthetase are mediated by the resulting increased levels of guanosine nucleotides.",,,,,

Spleen cells of mice infected with LLV or, for comparison, with the entire complex were added to cultures of sheep erythrocyte-primed uninfected spleen cells, and the antibody-forming cells produced by the latter, after antigen restimulation, were assayed. The addition within 2 days from culture initiation of low numbers of cells infected with either virus preparation suppressed all stages of the response affecting the production of both immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibody. The activity of infected cells resisted doses of ultraviolet radiation which inhibit cell multiplication but was abolished by disrupting the cells and was prevented by the presence of anti-LLV antibodies. The LLV-infected spleen cells responsible for suppression were not removed by treatments which selectively remove or kill macrophages and exhibited surface properties of B lymphocytes. These results were interpreted as indicating that the effect is due to virus (or viral products) released by B cells. The suppressing cells in the spleens of mice in the early days of Friend leukemia complex infection presented superimposable properties, supporting the concept that their activity is also due to the LLV they release in large quantities. However, in later stages of infection, the spleens of Friend leukemia complex-infected mice also contained non-B-suppressing cells possibly derived from the proliferation of nonlymphoid LLV-producing cells caused by the neoplastic process.",,PMC414252,,,

This study extends these observations to an analysis of receptor-bearing cells in the preleukemic and leukemic phases of spontaneous AKR thymic lymphomagenesis. AKR mice regularly begin expressing N-tropic retroviruses (as assayed on NIH fibroblasts by the XC plaque assay) in several tissues early in life; thymic lymphocytes also express these viruses, but are not autonomously transformed. Later thymic lymphomas emerge which are capable of metastasizing in the host of origin or transplanting leukemias into syngeneic hosts. Just prior to the appearance of thymic lymphomas, these mice also begin producing xenotropic retroviruses [as assayed in xenogeneic (For example, mink) fibroblasts], and concomitant with the appearance of the leukemias is the appearance of ""recombinant"" retroviruses which cause mink fibroblast foci (MCF); these viruses express elements of both N- and X-tropic virus envelopes and N-tropic viral gene products in their cores. Spontaneous AKR leukemias also produce other retroviruses which do not cause XC plaques or mink fibroblast foci; these are called SL viruses. The subject of this study was to test whether in vivo thymocytes in the preleukemic and leukemic periods also bear receptors specific for N-tropic, recombinant MCF and SL AKR retroviruses. We demonstrated that each spontaneous thymic lymphoma does bear receptors that bind viruses produced by the lymphomas and MCF-247 to a high degree and that bind N-ecotropic AKR retroviruses less well. Thymic lymphocytes predominating in the preleukemic period do not express detectable levels of receptors for either of the viruses. In some mice, receptor-positive cells co-exist with receptor-negative cells; only the receptor-positive cells are capable of transplanting leukemia to syngeneic hosts. We conclude that the presence of specific cell surface receptors for lymphoma cell-produced and recombinant AKR retroviruses is a marker for leukemia in these hosts.",,,,,

Aside from this mu-only phenotype, lines that make only light chain, both chains or no immunoglobulin-related polypeptides have also been found. Two lines have been studied in detail: one that makes only mu chain and one that makes only kappa light chain. Synthesis of both polypeptides can be increased by modifying the culture conditions so as to decrease the growth rate of the cells. Although some kappa chain secretion was observed, neither secreted nor surface mu was detected. We suggest that the mu- only phenotype may be an early normal step in the pathway of B lymphocyte maturation.",,,,,

The present paper formulates some thoughts on the role of cytogenetic changes in the subsequent neoplastic process. Initiation creates long-lived preneoplastic cells. In some respects, they are comparable to in vitro-transformed (""immortalized"") cell lines that maintain a diploid karyotype and are not tumorigenic in vivo. The development of a tumorigenic (""autonomous"") clone is dependent on additional changes at the genetic level. In human B and murine T cell lymphoma, there are characteristic nonrandom chromosomal changes. The 14q+ marker appears to play a key role in human B cell lymphomas. The reciprocal 8;14 translocation in Burkitt lymphoma is a specialized subclass within this category. In murine T cell leukemia, trisomy 15 is the predominant change. The clustering of these nonrandom changes to tumors derived from a certain cell type rather than to tumors induced by a given etiological agent has important implications for the understanding of the genetic control of cellular responsiveness to growth-regulating forces in vivo.",,PMC383618,,,

Two sets of sequences were distinguished in MH2 RNA: 66% hybridized with DNA complementary to helper-independent avian tumor viruses, termed group-specific, and 34% were specific. The percentage of specific sequences is considered a minimal estimate because the MH2 RNA used was about 30% contaminated by helper virus RNA. No sequences related to the transforming src gene of avian sarcoma viruses were found in MH2. MH2 shared three large T1 oligonucleotides with MC29, two of which could also be isolated from a RNase A- and T1-resistant hybrid formed between MH2 RNA and MC29 specific cDNA. These oligonucleotides belong to a group of six that define the specific segment of MC29 RNA described previously. The group-specific sequences of MH2 and MC29 RNA shared only the two smallest out of about 20 T1 oligonucleotides associated with MH2 RNA.

Thus, lipid analogues can be integrated into the bilayers of EL4 plasma membranes. The ability of the EL4 membranes containing trinitrophenyl phosphatidylethanolamine to induce a secondary proliferation of C57BL/6 mouse spleen lymphocytes primarily stimulated by trinitrophenyl-modified autologous cells was investigated.

There was no significant difference between the mean standing height SDS, height velocity SDS, somatomedin activities, and degree of bone age retardation between the 17 children who received the higher dose of cranial irradiation (Group 1) and the nine who had the lower dose of cranial irradiation (Group II). Furthermore, there was no significant reduction in mean height velocity SDS, somatomedin activity, or bone age in either group when compared to normal age-matched controls. The peak GH responses to both insulin hypoglycemia and an arginine test were significantly lowered in Groups I and II when compared to a control group of children.

Whereas tumor growth was inhibited after i.v. immunization with respect to incidence rate and time of tumor appearance, tumor growth was enhanced after i.m. injection. Animals that were injected with normal cell antigens served as controls. Spleen cells from only those animals that were immunized i.v. exerted a cytotoxic effect in vitro against ASV-transformed cells, whereas spleen cells from i.m. injected animals, in contrast, suppressed such cytotoxicity. The search for serum blocking or arming factors suggested that sera from i.m. injected animals block cellular cytotoxicity whereas sera from i.v. immunized animals render normal spleen cells cytotoxic (arming effect). The use of viruses from different subgroups and of antigens from gp85-lacking ASV-transformed cells indicates that immune effects were obtained against tumor cell surface antigens that differ from the antigen that is involved in virus neutralization (s-gp85).",,,,,

Lysozyme, which is continuously secreted by monocytes, which, in turn, migrate relatively late to inflammatory areas, was found to significantly dampen several responses of neutrophils to inflammatory stimulants. Thus, human lysozyme obtained and purified from the urine of patients with monocytic leukemia (but not its structurally similar and comparably cationic analogue, eggwhite lysozyme) depresses chemotaxis of normal neutrophils to activated complement, bacterial supernate, and N-formylmethionyl-phenylalanine. In addition, human (but not eggwhite) lysozyme depresses oxidative metabolism (hexose monophosphate shunt activity) and superoxide generation of neutrophils. The specificity of the suppressive effects was indicated by inhibition studies with rabbit antihuman lysozyme antibody, and with the trisaccharide of N-acetylglucosamine, a specific inhibitor of lysozyme. The results suggest that lysozyme, a product of inflammatory cells themselves, may function in a negative feedback system to modulate the inflammatory response.",,PMC372109,,,

Adenylate cyclase activity, expressed as picomoles [(32)P]cyclic AMP generated per milligram protein per minute, was 57+/-4 in normals and 26+/-4 in CLL patients. Enzyme activity, expressed as picomoles [(32)P]cyclic AMP generated per 10(6) lymphocytes per minute, was 2.09+/-0.19 for normal lymphocytes and 1.10+/-0.16 for CLL lymphocytes. The differences between normal and CLL peripheral lymphocytes are highly significant (P < 0.001) with either method of calculating activity. Cyclic AMP levels (picomoles per 10(6) lymphocytes) also differed significantly: 1.38+/-0.29 for normals and 0.45+/-0.08 for CLL lymphocytes. Adenylate cyclase was assayed in lymphocytes enriched for bone marrow-derived (B) cells by removing E-rosetted thymus-derived (T) cells, and enriched for T cells by harvesting E-rosetted lymphocytes or by removing B cells with nylon wool absorption. Solutions to simultaneous equations gave the following calculated enzyme activities for pure B- and T-cell subpopulations (in picomoles [(32)P]cyclic AMP generated per milligram mg protein per minute): normal B, 196+/-22; normal T, 30+/-10; CLL B, 34+/-6; CLL T, 19+/-4. Thus. normal B-lymphocyte adenylate cyclase exceeds normal T-lymphocyte activity by more than sixfold, whereas in the case of CLL the enzyme activity in B lymphocytes is markedly reduced to levels comparable to T lymphocytes. The responses of lymphocytes to stimulation with the hormones prostaglandin E(1) and isoproterenol, and with NaF, were assessed. Compared with normal lymphocytes, enzyme activities were reduced in CLL lymphocytes incubated with these agents, but to a degree paralleling the reduced basal activities. Thus, the ratios between stimulated and basal adenylate cyclase levels in Ficoll-Hypaque-purified, normal lymphocytes were 2.3+/-0.1 after incubation with 10 muM isoproterenol, and 3.9+/-0.2 with 10 mM NaF, values which did not differ significantly from those obtained with CLL lymphocytes. When the enzyme activities calculated for purified T- and B-lymphocyte subpopulations were used to derive the stimulation ratios, the responses of normal and CLL T and B cells to these agents were also indistinguishable. The simplest explanation for these findings is a reduced number of normally responsive enzyme sites on the surface membranes of CLL lymphocytes, although alternative explanations are possible.",,PMC372059,,,

Increases up to 30-fold occurred within 30 seconds of incubation at 37 degrees C, to be succeeded by a fall which reached the basal level between 5 and 7 min. The response was proportional to the amount of antibody present. Cross-linking of surface Ig by the antibody was necessary, bivalent (Fab'gamma)2 from the antibody gave a rise in cAMP similar to that given by the parent molecule, whereas monomeric Fab'gamma was ineffective unless it was subsequently cross-linked by anti-antibody. The rise was too rapid to have required capping of the surface Ig for its induction. Not all perturbations of the plasma membrane by antibody induce such a surge in cAMP, since anti-beta2 microglobulin, also reacting with the lymphocyte surface, failed to alter cAMP concentration.

The absence of neutralizing activity at a serum dilution of 1:4 indicated susceptibility of the donor to VZV infection and correlated with an absence of FAMA (titer, less than 1:2). A survey of susceptible leukemic children exposed to chicken pox revealed that several recipients of zoster immune globulin had a subclinical infection, as manifested by seroconversion and persistence of neutralizing antibody to VZV.

Radioimmunocompetition analysis of the purified murine mammary tumor virus major core protein as well as analysis of the RNA binding properties of purified low molecular weight type C virus proteins suggests that neither antigenic reactivity nor specific RNA binding characteristics are altered by the purification protocols.

This technique has now been applied to cell-surface glycoproteins of different human hematopoietic cell lines. These lines included Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-carrying lymphoblastoid cell lines of presumed non-neoplastic origin, and malignant EBV-genome-positive Burkitt lymphoma and EBV-negative non-Burkitt lymphoma, leukemia and myeloma lines. As compared with normal peripheral lymphocytes, both the lymphoblastoid type of cell lines and the different types of lines of proven malignant ancestry contained the fast-eluting glycopeptides on their cell surface with very few exceptions. It is therefore concluded that (I) malignant conversion of human lymphoid cell in vivo is commonly, but not obligatorily, associated with a specific change in the composition of the fucosyl glycopeptides, and (2) EBV infection of B lymphocytes does not lead only to the well-documented immortalization in vitro but also, as a rule, to the same type of alteration in fucosyl glycopeptides as was demonstrated for the neoplastic cell lines. It proved possible to distinguish several categories of hematopoietic cell lines due to the effect that pretreatment of the glycopeptides with neuraminidase or mild acid exerted on their subsequent chromatographic behavior.",,,,,

The regression of the MSV-induced tumors was inhibited when the weanling (three-to-four-week-old) mice were injected with the anti-IF serum. Using the anti-IF serum it has been found that the antagonism between HSV-2 and Rauscher leukemia virus in the mouse is not mediated by interferon. It is suggested that interferon is an important factor controlling growth of virus and/or virus induced tumor cells in the mouse before it develops a strong immunological response.,,,,,

The CLL lymphocytes of untreated patients were unresponsive to mitogens but became responsive in remission. The CLL monocytes from both untreated and treated patients transformed into macrophages. The pattern of shared enzyme deficiency among lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils of CLL patients and its normalization in all three cell types under remission suggest that the differentiation of the three leukocytic cell lines may be an enzymatically interlinked process and that the deficiency of these enzymes in leukemia may reflect an interrelated aberrant differentiation of the leukemic cells.",,PMC2042293,,,

Two morphologic types of lymphosarcomas are the undifferentiated lymphosarcoma (LS) and the plasmacytic lymphosarcoma (PL). With the electron microscope, both tumor cell types may be mixed and contain undifferentiated cells or cells with a moderate amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum and polysomes. PL tumors are composed predominantly of the latter. In biosynthetic studies, PL tumors produce more immunoglobulin (Ig) than LS and more of the Ig-heavy chain, which is thought to be the murine counterpart of IgD. PL-cells sensitized with rabbit antisera to mouse kappa chains formed rosettes with formalinized protein-A producing Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I strain. The rabbit antisera were specific for kappa chains by absorption. The failure of lymphosarcoma cells to secrete Ig indicates their differentiation is blocked by the transformation process.

Virol. 25:146-156, 1978). Clone 8A cells release virus particles which do not form plaques in the standard XC test. However, approximately 10(2) particles per ml of clone 8A supernatant do form plaques in a modified XC test (the ""complementation plaque assay""), in which the assay cells are coinfected with the XC-negative, nondefective amphotropic MuLV as well as the test virus. Superinfection of clone 8A cells themselves with amphotropic MuLV results in the production of approximately 10(5), rather than approximately 10(2), particles per ml which register in the complementation plaque assay. This increase is due to the rescue of replication-defective ecotropic MuLV from clone 8A cells by amphotropic MuLV since (i) this ecotropic MuLV can only form XC plaques in cells which are coinfected with amphotropic MuLV; and (ii) it is possible to transmit this defective variant, rescued from superinfected clone 8A cells, to a fresh clone of normal mouse cells. The time course of production of the rescued MuLV particles by superinfected clone 8A cells is virtually identical to that of rescue from these cells of murine sarcoma virus. Amphotropic MuLV superinfection of ""NP-N"" cells, which contain a ""non-plaque-forming"" variant of N-tropic MuLV (Hopkins and Jolicoeur, J.

Similar levels of hybridizable MuMTV RNA were observed between the D1 or D2 HAN line and mammary tumors derived from each HAN line. The D2 HAN line as well as D2, C4, and CD8 mammary tumors accumulated RNA that was apparently homologous to most of the MuMTV genome. Thermal denaturation of hybrids indicated extensive sequence homology between the MuMTV cDNA and hybridizable RNA in the BALB/c HAN lines and mammary tumors. A low level of type C viral RNA was observed in the BALB/c HAN lines and most mammary tumors by molecular hybridization with a cDNA to Moloney murine leukemia virus. These data demonstrate that MuMTV sequences are frequently expressed in hormone-induced BALB/c HAN lines and mammary tumors derived from HAN lines or ductal hyperplasias induced in BALB/c mice by hormones and/or a chemical carcinogen. The transition from the preneoplastic to the neoplastic state in BALB/c mice does not appear to be due to a change in the steady-state levels of MuMTV RNA since the hormone-induced HAN lines and mammary tumors had similar levels of hybridizable MuMTV RNA.",,PMC353180,,,

However, the mechanism by which virions select host tRNA's has not been elucidated. We have considered a model which specifies that 35S genomic RNA determines which tRNA's are to be encapsidated as well as the relative amounts of these tRNA's within the virion. The model was tested by comparing the free 4S RNA composition of normal murine leukemia virus (MuLV) particles and noninfectious virions from actinomycin D (ActD)-treated cells, which are deficient in genomic RNA (ActD virions). Viral 4S RNA was analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Surprisingly, the patterns obtained for control and ActD 4S RNA were identical to each other and were clearly distinct from the cell 4S RNA pattern. The viral patterns had three prominent areas of radioactivity. One of the spots was identified on the basis of its oligonucleotide fingerprint as tRNA (Pro), the primer for MuLV RNA-directed DNA synthesis. These results were obtained with two different MuLV strains, AKR and Moloney, each grown in SC-1 cells. The demonstration that ActD virions contain primer tRNA and in general exhibit the characteristic MuLV tRNA pattern rather than the complete representation of cell 4S RNA leads to the conclusion that genomic RNA is not the major determinant in selective packaging of host tRNA's. A possible role for one or more viral proteins, including reverse transcriptase, is suggested.",,PMC353124,,,

The previous observation that rapid increases in cellular synthesis and cell-surface expression of H-2 antigens are detectable immediately after virus inoculation has suggested that altered expression of H-2 antigens may play a significant role in the mechanism(s) of host defense to virus infection. This concept is supported by the following observations. First, cell-mediated immunity against RadLV transformed or infected cells can be detected with ease when H-2-positive target cells are used in the cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) assay. (Although RadLV transformed cells obtained from overtly leukemic animals and maintained in tissue culture are H-2 negative, these cells can regain their H-2 phenotype by in vivo passage in normal animals. The H-2-negative cells are poor targets in a CML assay.) Second, resistant mice develop greater numbers of effectors when infected with RadLV than do susceptible mice. Third, injection of normal (uninfected) thymocytes into syngeneic recipients of resistant or susceptible H-2 type does not stimulate a CML response. However, injection of RadLV infected thymocytes from resistant mice produces a vigorous CMI response, and such thymocytes elicit the strongest response at a time when both H-2 and viral antigen expression is elevated. By contrast, injection of infected thymocytes from susceptible mice, which express viral antigens, but low levels of H-2 antigens, does not stimulate a CML reaction. These findings may explain the easier induction of leukemia found by many investigators when virus is inoculated into neonatal mice and the preferential thymus tropism of some oncogenic type-C RNA virus. Cells expressing very low levels of H-2, such as thymocytes, may serve as permissive targets for virus infection because they lack an important component (H-2 antigens) of the dual or altered recognition signal required to trigger a defensive host immune response.",,PMC2184854,,,

For the activation of murine leukemia virus by IdUrd, its incorporation into cellular DNA is necessary. We have explored the possibility that incorporated IdUrd qualitatively alters the transcription of cell DNA. Nucleic acid hybridization between radioactive mouse unique DNA and RNA from the highly activatable mouse AKR-2B cell line indicates that the normal extent of transcription in AKR-2B cells is considerably lower than that observed in other lines of mouse cells studied. Treatment of AKR-2B cells with IdUrd increases the extent of transcription of unique DNA by 60%, which corresponds to an induction of approximately 2.5 X 10(4) gene equivalents. Included among this new set of RNA's are sequences that are transcribed from the DNA genome of the endogenous AKR-type murine leukemia virus present in AKR-2B cells. IdUrd treatment also markedly increases the synthesis and/or the accumulation of those RNA transcripts which are normally expressed in untreated cells. These results suggest that IdUrd stimulates the overall transcription activity of AKR-2B cells.

These oligonucleotides were shown to lie in the 5' third of the oligonucleotide maps of their respective viruses. We sequenced the three oligonucleotides and found that they share a 10 base sequence. Together these observations provide good evidence that the determinants of N-, B- or NB-tropism monitored by the three oligonucleotides are allelic. The oligonucleotides associated with N- and B-tropism differ in sequence at four of sixteen nucleotides, while the B- and NB-tropism-associated oligonucleotides differ in sequence by only one base out of sixteen. These results are consistent with the possibilities that B-tropic viruses may arise from N-tropic viruses by recombination, while NB-tropic viruses may arise from B-tropic virus by mutation. An unexplained finding was that a 10 base sequence present in the oligonucleotide associated with N-tropism is also found in the 3' third of the genomes of the N-, B- and NB-tropic viruses studied.",,,,,

The object of this paper was to determine the effect of neonatal thymectomy (xT) on allogeneic tumor incidence and on anti-tumor cytophilic activity. The latter was determined by the adherence of lymphoma cells to guinea pig peritoneal macrophages previously incubated with preheated mouse serum. The results obtained, in 2-3 month old animals, show no difference in lethal tumor incidence between xT and intact mice, 36% (14/39) vs. 39% (14/36). Neither did xT alter the significant increase in cytophilic antibodies detected in regressor serum, 115 +/- 15 (S.E.) vs. 106+/- 22 0/00 macrophages bearing tumor cells as compared to control values in either xT or normal serum, 53 +/- 3 vs 52 +/- 3. This background cytophilic activity was not significantly altered in progressor serum of either xT or intact mice, 36 +/- 5 vs 65 +/- 6. The specificity of the antitumor cytophilic antibodies was determined by the negative results obtained when a different tumor was used as target cell. It can be concluded that ant-tumor cytophilic antibodies are detectable in regressor but not in progressor serum. Thymectomy in this model does not alter either in vivo tumor incidence or humoral cytophilic activity. Since no thymic remnants were encountered at autopsy, it is postulated that AKR lymphoma cells, which proved to be neoplastic T cells, are capable of rendering T-immunocompetent a thymectomized allogeneic BALB host.",,,,,

Absorption analysis of (C3Hf/Bi x akr)f1 and AKR-Fv-1b sera with selective reactivity for MCF 247-infected cells showed that these sera recognize distinctive antigens on MCF 247-infected cells that are not present on ecotropic or xenotropic MuLV-infected cells.

Thymocytes from young mice of high leukemia-incidence strains (AKR, C58, and PL) express G(AKSL2), whereas thymocytes from 12 other strains do not. In AKR mice, the antigen is expressed in higher amounts on cells from thymus and bone marrow than on spleen cells. All AKR spontaneous leukemias tested express G(AKSL2), as did three MuLV-induced leukemias arising in G(AKSL2)- strains. Five X-ray-induced leukemias of G(AKSL2)- strains were G(AKSL2)-, as were MuLV+ and MuLV- chemically induced sarcomas. In the limited survey conducted to date, natural antibody to G(AKSL2) has been restricted to strains expressing G(AKSL2) in their normal tissues: AKR, AKR congenic mice AKR-Fv-1b and AKR hybrid mice (C3Hf/Bi x akr)f1 and (C57BL/6 X AKR)F1. In vitro G(AKSL2) induction tests involving MuLV infection of cultured monolayer cells showed that 8 of 12 newly isolated dualtropic MuLV shared the property of G(AKSL2) induction with the prototype MCF MuLV, MCF 247. Of the 12 ecotropic MuLV tested, only the N-tropic MuLV isolated from a leukemia originally induced by Passage A Gross virus induced G(AKSL2). The xenotropic and amphotropic MuLV isolates tested lacked G(AKSL2) inducing activity. Recognition of the g(aksl2) system provides a way to trace the origin and natural history of a class of dualtropic MCF MuLV in the mouse and to determine whether natural antibody to G(AKSL2) plays a role in AKR leukemogenesis.",,PMC2184729,,,

Epidemilogically, serologically, and virologically, infections with this type of virus can contradict classic infectious disease dogma. Therefore, previous studies that failed to link characteristics of infectious diseases (epidemiologic, serologic, or virologic) to human cancer must be cautiously interpreted.

These newly recognized particles are much more numerous and prominent than Auer rods. They may be rapidly and readily identified using the microscope in marrow or peripheral blood films when the procedures recommended in this paper for fixation, incubation for hydroperoxidase demonstration in 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB)/H2O2 medium, copper salt treatment and counterstaining (optional) with the Papanicolaou method are employed. Films prepared in the same manner but treated with benzidine/H2O2 medium for myeloperoxidase did not reveal these particles. We believe that Phi bodies are pathognomonic of AML since they are almost invariably present in AML patients with active disease. Their presence serves to distinguish AML from acute lymphocytic leukemia and from chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis. Since the particles disappear in disease remission and reappear upon relapse, the recommended procedure is not only useful in diagnosis but in guiding therapy. When a very rapid diagnosis is needed, it is not necessary to counterstain the preparations, but the nuclei, cytoplasm and plasmalemma can readily be observed in the granulocyte precursors when they are counterstained by the Papanicolaou method. This treatment does not diminish the clarity of the Phi bodies and rods which stain by virtue of their peroxidatic activity. This cytochemical diagnostic procedure should be considered for adoption by hematology laboratories.",,,,,

Depending on the time interval between drug treatment and subsequent exposure to antibody and complement, the tumor cells can be either more resistant or more susceptible to antibody when compared to control cells. The number of tumor cells surviving the combined treatment was determined by a colony inhibition assay. The two antisera used in this study were directed against either virus-specific or myeloma protein-specific antigens on the surface of S107 murine myeloma cells; identical results were obtained with both sera. Twenty-four hours after exposure to the drug, the number of tumor cells surviving the antibody treatment increased. During this period of increased resistance, the tumor cells were temporarily arrested in the G(2) phase of the cell cycle. After this period of maximal resistance, the effect of cytotoxic antibody on the cells changed such that 4 days after melphalan treatment the cells were significantly more susceptible to the antibody than were the sham-treated control cells. The period of increased susceptibility correlated with an increased density of S107 myeloma protein and viral antigens on the surface of the tumor cells. Eight days after the drug treatment, the susceptibility of the tumor cells and the density of surface antigens both returned to normal levels. This study shows that the correct time interval between exposure to a drug and subsequent treatment with antibody is critical for maximal killing of the tumor cells. The basis for the differential sensitivity of the tumor cells to anti-body may be related to the drug-induced changes in the cell cycle and in antigen expression on the cell surface.",,PMC393147,,,

Oligonucleotides of group-specific sequences mapped between 0 and 0.4 and between 0.7 and 1 map unit. Cell-free translation of viral RNA yielded three proteins with approximate molecular weights of 120,000, 56,000, and 37,000, termed P120(mc), P56(mc), and P37(mc). P120(mc) contained both MC29-specific peptides and serological determinants and peptides of the conserved, internal group-specific antigens of avian tumor viruses. P120(mc) is translated only from full-length 28S RNA. Furthermore, MC29 RNA contains sequences related to the group-specific antigen gene (gag), near the 5' end, which are followed by MC29-specific sequences. We conclude that this protein is translated from the 5' 60% of the RNA, and that it includes a segment translated from the specific sequences.

The binding of fluoresceinated or rhodaminated MuLV to target cells showed saturation kinetics and was blocked by homologous MuLV, and bound MuLV had a polypeptide profile identical to that of input MuLV. Thymic lymphomas bound specifically the MuLV which induced them, whereas only 0.5 to 2% of normal thymocytes showed equivalent MuLV binding. Simultaneous binding of excess fluoresceinated RadLV and rhodaminated MCF-247 AKR virus to radiation leukemia virus-induced or spontaneous AKR thymic lymphomas demonstrated that even in the presence of both viruses the cells bound preferentially the inducing MuLV. Examination of the C57BL/Ka endogenous viruses showed that radiation leukemia virus-induced thymic lymphomas bind only thymotropic-leukemogenic radiation leukemia virus and not eco- or xenofibrotropic MuLV's. Thus, virus binding in this system involves only leukemogenic isolates of these retroviruses and implies a central role of this receptor-ligand interaction in the processes of leukemic transformation.",,PMC525806,,,

This probe was then used to study the expression of MMTV RNA in cell lines from BALB/c tumors induced in vivo either spontaneously or in response to viral, chemical, or hormonal stimuli. The cDNA had a length of approximately 400 to 500 nucleotides and specifically hybridized to MMTV RNA and BALB/c lactating mammary gland RNA, but not to Moloney leukemia virus RNA. Calf thymus DNA-primed cDNA could protect 50% of iodinated MMTV RNA from S1 nuclease digestion at cDNA-RNA ratios of 1:1 and 90% of labeled viral RNA at ratios of 10:1. Thermal denaturation of MMTV RNA-cDNA hybrids yielded a T(m) of 88.5 degrees C, indicative of a well-base-paired duplex. Screening of mouse mammary tumor cells for MMTV sequences revealed that three out of five lines of BALB/c origin had undetectable levels of viral RNA (<three molecules per cell) by RNA excess hybridization. Two of the three ""virus-negative"" cell lines were derived from tumors induced by the chemical carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(alpha)anthracene, whereas the third tumor occurred spontaneously. Two lines from tumors induced by either viral (mammary tumor virus) or hormonal (17-beta-estradiol) stimulus contained between three and nine molecules of MMTV RNA per cell by both RNA excess and cDNA excess hybridization.

The incidence and latency of lymphoma and the incidence of glomerulonephritis were also determined. The mice studied could be divided into high-responder and low-responder groups. Most of the high ANA antibody could be attributed to anti-histone antibody. High response was associated with the H-2b haplotype and recombinant strains on the B10 background which were identical at the I-A subregion derived from the H-2b parental stock. In contrast, low ANA response was associated with the I-A subregion derived from the H-2k haplotype. In all groups of virus-inoculated animals, most animals developed serum elevations of p30 and gp70 and at least 72% of the inoculated animals developed lymphomas. High serum p30 levels correlated inversely with latency and directly with gp70 values.

A negative Coombs test indicated that there was no evidence for erythrocyte-bound antibody. Erythrocytes from infected animals had slightly decreased 51Cr-labeled erythrocyte survival time when compared with normal. Examination of marrow histological preparations, together with ferrokinetic studies with 59Fe, indicated that marrow failure occurred during the acute phase of the anemia.

In 11 cases of congenital infection, CMV EA-Ab was always associated with CMV excretion whether immunoglobulin M antibody was present or not. Nine mothers of congenitally infected infants had CMV EA-Ab for several months after delivery, but association with CMV elimination was not established when urine and/or saliva were tested for virus isolation. In all nine cases of primary CMV infection, CMV EA-Ab was present, and in five its detection was associated with CMV isolation. In one case, disappearance of EA-Ab occurred when virus excretion ceased. In five cases of reactivated CMV infections, a consistent association between CMV EA-Ab and virus isolation was found. Six of 31 leukemia children had CMV EA-Ab, and virus was isolated from 3 of these. Four of 28 pregnant women showed EA-Ab in their serum, but tests for isolation were not done.

The magnitude of the early decrease in 86Rb+ influx correlates with the proportion of cells in cultures of inducible Friend cell clones which later go on to synthesize hemoglobin. Compounds which do not incude differentiation in these cells, such as xanthine, exogenous hematin, and erythropoietin, do not cause a change in 86Rb+ influx.

The cells of one of these lymphomas have been established in vitro as a permanent cell line, BALB/Nu1.

The characteristics of the tumor cells support the view that cells with T-cell markers may normally exist in nude mice and undergo neoplastic transformation and clonal expansion after infection with a leukemogenic virus. The alternative possibility that virus-induced differentiation of prothymocytes may lead to the expression of Thy-1.2 and Ly-2.2 antigens is also considered. BALB/Nu1 cells release large numbers of type C viral particles. The virus, designated radiation leukemia virus (RadLV)/Nu1, has RTase activity and the protein profile characteristic of murine leukemia virus (MuLV).

On inoculation into C57BL/Ka mice it has thymotropic and leukemogenic activity. In vitro it is B-tropic, poorly fibrotropic, and has limited xenotropic activity.

It appears that Moloney sarcoma virus and possibly other oncornaviruses cannot be used to augment the TATA activity of tumor cell membranes in the same way that other surface-budding viruses can.",,,,,

With the immunofluorescent technic, the antisera were found to react with 2--23% of normal blood lymphocytes. Simultaneous staining of normal cells with anti-EP and for surface immunoglobulins (SIg) on bone-marrow-derived B-cells showed that the proportions of stained cells were similar to percentages of cells stained by anti-EP alone or for SIg alone. The percentage of anti-EP reactive cells also approximated the percentages of cells reactive to a known antiserum to human B-cell associated, or Ia-like, antigens. The anti-EP reacted with lymphoblastoid cells from two B-cell lines lacking the Epstein-Barr viral genome. The antigens detected by anti-EP probably are B-cell-associated. The anti-EP intensely stained neoplastic cells of acute or chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphosarcoma-cell leukemia. Cells from two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and from two patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia showed increased intensity of anti-EP staining and/or increased proportions of stained cells following overnight incubation in culture medium, compared with the preincubation samples. This observation suggests the presence of a ""blocking component(s)"" on cell surfaces, which interfered with anti-EP reactivity. After overnight incubation, the component might have been removed from the antigenic sites on cell surfaces. Further studies of leukemia lymphocytes using anti-EP for the cell-bound ""blocking component"" may reveal important pathogenetic mechanisms.",,,,,

Ara-C kinase activity in AH-66F cells, which were moderately sensitive to ara-C, was approximately the same as that in the bone marrow of tumor-bearing rats. L-1210 leukemia, which is sensitive to ara-C, had a higher activity of the enzyme than the mouse bone marrow. On the other hand, the naturally resistant hepatomas, AH-60C, AH-109A, and AH-66, were low in their ara-C kinase activity. The enzyme activity in the cytoplasmic extract (30,000 g supernatant) of the tumor and bone marrow cells was nearly proportional to the capacity for ara-C phosphorylation in intact cells. Thus, the mechanism of natural resistance to ara-C in rat ascites hepatomas was attributed mainly to the low levels of ara-C kinase activity itself. Apparent Km of the enzyme for ara-C was about 170 micron. However, probably due to the presence of the uncompetitive type of inhibitor(s), the level of apparent Km lowered close to 40 micron at higher concentration of the protein as the source of the enzyme, showing similarity to the value in intact cells.",,,,,

In the case of breast cancer patients, occurrence of tha antibody was not specifically related to a particular type of tumor histology. In a considerable number of positive cases, the antibody tended to disappear within various lengths of time after surgical operation of the breast cancer.",,,,,

This transmission usually is complex, requiring close contact with pets or their excretions and frequently involves a breach of sound hygienic practice. In some instances, pathogens of animal origin are acquired inadvertently because infectivity can persist after evidence of gross contamination has gone. Veterinarians participate in controlling zoonotic diseases by encouraging rabies vaccination and hygienic treatment of pet feces and urine, by supporting community efforts toward responsible pet ownership and by advising on precautions for handling sick animals. It is recommended that veterinarians discourage the keeping of wild or exotic animals as pets and excess fondling of pets (particularly by children and pregnant women).

Important advances in the systemic control of a number of malignancies have been described. These are examples of a few of the presently ongoing trials (Salmon and Jones, 1977). For the merits and demerits of prophylactic systemic treatments to be accurately determined in malignant disease, it is important that the future role of adjuvant chemotherapy in man be evaluated only in the context of carefully controlled clinical trials. The fact that adjuvant therapy is effective in prolonging survival in some malignant diseases is established; its role in many of the commoner malignant diseases awaits more complete evaluation.",,,,,

The degree of inhibition was dependent on the templates used: activated DNA, synthetic hybrids, poly(rA).dT12-18 and poly(rC).dG12-18, and the synthetic copolymer, poly(DA-dT).

Complementary DNA (cDNA) probes to globin genes and to the murine leukemia type C RNA virus (MuLV) genome were used to detect the presence of RNA complementary to these genes in RNA extracted from brain and liver in young and old mice. Significant amounts of globin RNA were found in brain nuclei and cytoplasm. No age difference was found in the globin RNA sequences present, but the number of globin RNA molecules increased from about 15 in 6-month to 34 in 27-month-old animals for nuclei and 280 in 6-month to 500 in 27-month-old animals for cytoplasm.

Analysis of infected cell extracts on sucrose density gradients demonstrates that the majority of the polyribosomes have dissociated to monoribosomes at 2 h postinfection. Physical measurements of infected-cell RNAs support this conclusion and demonstrate that the polyadenylated RNAs decrease in size. The degradation of mRNA is apparently a stochastic process as judged by the failure to detect a shift in the Crt1/2 when polyadenylated RNA extracted from infected cells at different times is hybridized to globin complementary DNA. In experiments designed to determine whether dissociation of polyribosomes is sufficient to cause degradation of globin mRNA, the amount of globin mRNA in uninfected cells did not change when cells were treated with NaF or pactamycin at concentrations sufficient to dissociate all polyribosomes. In cells infected with UV-irradiated virus polyribosomes dissociate but globin mRNA does not degrade, suggesting that it is possible to separate dissociation from degradation.",,PMC525850,,,

In NRK cells, they produced obscure small plaques at reduced efficiencies relative to their plaque-producing efficiencies in mouse SC-1 cells (10-fold for FN-2 and 100-fold for WNB-2). After three or four passages in NRK cells, the plaquing efficiencies of the viruses in NRK cells increased to levels close to their efficiencies in mouse cells, and the plaques in NRK cells became larger and clearer. The adaptation was more complete with FN-2 than with WNB-2. The adaptation was not due to simple selection of a virus in the FN-2 stock, but was host induced, as the viruses had been submitted to successive limiting dilutions in SC-1 cells before propagation in NRK cells. Possible commitment of xenotropic virus in the adaptation was excluded. The change was stable, even if the adapted viruses were propagated back into SC-1 cells. The NRK-adapted viruses were restricted in other rat cell lines of different origins, and the virus adapted in another rat cell line, RFL, was still restricted in NRK cells. The adaptation was mainly brought about by increased viral growth within the rat cells and not by an increased efficiency of viral penetration into the rat cells. This inversely suggests that the restriction of the ecotropic murine leukemia viruses in NRK cells was a mainly intracellular event. The mobilities of gp69/71 and p30 in sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis remained unchanged after adaptation of FN-2 in NRK cells.",,PMC525849,,,

In an attempt to isolate additional env gene recombinants between Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) and xenotropic virus, we have inoculated cloned ecotropic F-MuLV into newborn NIH Swiss mice and analyzed MuLV released from preleukemic and leukemic spleens of infected mice. Two helper-independent MCF strains of F-MuLV have been isolated. Like the previously described AKR-MCF viruses, the Friend MCF viruses are env gene recombinants between an ecotropic virus (F-MuLV) and a mouse xenotropic virus, as shown by host range, interference pattern, and tryptic peptide analysis of the gp70s of these MuLV. Furthermore, RNA from the Friend MCF viruses hybridizes completely to cDNAsffv, a nucleic acid probe which detects that portion of SFFV which was not derived from P-MuLV. The ability to isolate replicating MCF viruses derived from F-MuLV FURTHER strengthens the parallels between the Friend erythroleukemia system and the AKR thymic leukemia system.

To detect the FeLV-antigen a simple indirect fluorescent antibody technique (FAT) was used to detect FeLV-antigen. During a period of four years, the following results were obtained when a removal programme was carried out by a large cat breeders' association in the Netherlands. The proportion of catteries, in which FeLV-positive cats were found to be present, decreased from 11.5 per cent in the former half of 1974 to 2.1 per cent in the latter half of 1977. The proportion of FeLV-positive cats and male studs decreased from 4.9 per cent to 1.2 per cent and from 5.9 per cent to 1.0 per cent respectively during this period.

Three major peaks of activity are seen, with apparent molecular weights of 25,000, 12,000, and 7000. The sarcoma growth factors are heat-stable, trypsin-sensitive, and active in nanogram quantities when tested for growth stimulation of untransformed rat and mouse fibroblasts. All three molecular species are also capable of competing for membrane epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors when tested with 125I-labeled EGF. They differ from mouse EGF, however, in their molecular weights, in their inability to react with anti-EGF antibodies, and in their ability to convert cells to anchorage independent (agar) growth. For the above reasons, we conclude that the sarcoma growth factors are a new class of polypeptide tropic factors that confer on fibroblasts in vitro properties associated with the transformed phenotype.",,PMC392918,,,

Absorption analysis using 40 tumors and 21 cell lines revealed that two serologic specificities were detected by this test system: (i) FMR antigen(s) related to the Moloney MuLV helper (the virus from which A-MuLV was originally derived), and (ii) an antigen expressed on all cells transformed by A-MuLV.

In light of the original isolation of A-MuLV from a BALB/c mouse infected with Moloney virus, it is possible that Abelson antigen is a serologic marker for a gene of BALB/c mice, normally encoding a cell surface molecule, that was incorporated into the Moloney virus genome during the generation of A-MuLV.",,PMC392900,,,

Using long reverse transcripts of Mo-MuLV, a region of nonhomology has been mapped by electron microscopic analysis of heteroduplexes formed with HIX 35S virion RNA. In this nonhomology region, the Mo-MuLV cDNA strand measured approximately 900 nucleotides, mapping between 1.6 and 2.5 kilobases from the 3' end. In a previous study, hybridization of Mo-MuLV 21S RNA with Mo-MuLV cDNA resulted in the formation of different heteroduplex structures diagnostic of a noncontiguously coded leader sequence at the 5' end of the 21S RNA. Following hybridization of poly(A)+ HIX 21S RAN with 8.2 kb Mo-MuLV cDNA, analogous heteroduplex structures were observed exhibiting the Mo-MuLV:HIX substitution loop in the DNA:RNA segment of the molecules. This analysis permitted more precise mapping of the nonhomology region with respect to the splice point in the 21S presumptive glycoprotein mRNA. The mapping of this nonhomology region in HIX virus provides an internal visual marker for the 3' end of the genome which may prove useful in future analyses of other deletion or substitution derivatives of Mo-MuLV.",,,,,

Two groups given relatively virulent bursal disease viruses, which destroyed bursal lymphoid cells, did not develop lymphoid leukosis.

The use of early-passage indicator bovine embryonic spleen (BESP) cells and their pretreatment with diethylamino-ethyl-dextran (DEAE-D) was essential for optimal sensitivity. Polybrene was less effective than DEAE-D. The combination of DEAE-D and polybrene was more effective than DEAE-D alone when BLV-infected leukocytes were used as the inoculum, but not when the inoculum was a cell-free BLV preparation. Using BESP cell passages 4 to 11 as indicators, reproducible titers were obtained when aliquots of the same virus stock were assayed at different times after freezer storage. When assaying peripheral blood lymphocytes from infected cattle, optimal syncytia responses were observed consistently by inoculating 5 X 10(6) viable lymphocytes per 60-mm Falcon dish. Centrifugation of peripheral blood leukocytes from BLV-infected cattle in discontinuous bovine serum albumin gradients can be used to separate a subpopulation of infected lymphocytes. Use of this subpopulation as the inoculum, rather than unseparated buffy-coat leukocytes, greatly increases the sensitivity of the syncytia infectivity assay.",,,,,

These positive sera were derived only from farms which exploited one or more imported animals. A disagreement of results of the three tests was observed in 38 (2.5%) cases.

P120 is phosphorylated and has an intracellular half-life of 3--6 hr. In vitro translation of virion RNA from A-MuLV, with Moloney MuLV as helper, yields a product of molecular weight 120,000 with serological reactivity similar to that of the cellular P120. Translation of the RNA from the helper gave no P120. P120 is expressed in all lymphoid and fibroblastic cell lines we have tested that were transformed by A-MuLV but is not detectable in a lymphoid line in which the A-MuLV genome was established by infection but was not responsible for the transformation. Expression of P120 is selectively retained in clones of A-MuLV-transformed lymphocytes that convert to a nonproducer state after loss of expression of helper MuLV intracellular precursors.

The viruses of the other group replicated well in both mouse and mink cells, producing morphologic changes similar to transformation but not XC syncytia; they, therefore, are members of the newly described MCF class of mouse type C viruses. Isolates from either group were highly leukemogenic on retesting, the mean latent period being 67 days for a mouse-tropic virus and 105 days for one of the dual-tropic viruses. The results led to the conclusion that the better a mouse type C virus grows in cell culture the more effective it is as a leukemogen. Further, it is possible to start with a weakly infectious, nonleukemogenic virus and to convert it to a rapidly replicating, highly leukemogenic virus by passage either in cell culture or in the animal. The availability of a defined series of viruses from a low-leukemia mouse strain that differ greatly in their biologic properties should facilitate studies of the molecular basis for the acquisition of type C virus oncogenicity.",,PMC392575,,,

The in vitro system used was capable of synthesizing double-stranded DNA, but the plus strands (same polarity as the viral RNA) were only 0.5 to 1.5 kb long. Lone Moloney murine leukemia virus cDNA transcripts were used as templates to synthesize the second plus strand. Essentially two strategies were employed as follows. (i) The 3' ends of the cDNA transcripts were extended by addition of 50 to 100 dAMP residues by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The (dA)n-tailed cDNA transcripts were used as templates along with an oligomer of dT as primer and Escherichia coli DNA polymerase to synthesize the plus strands. (ii) DNase-digested calf thymus DNA was used to prime the synthesis of plus strands on long cDNA with E. coli DNA polymerase I. In both cases, the synthesis of the plus strands was monitored by increased resistance of the cDNA templates to single-strand-specific S1 nuclease. The double-stranded DNA was fractionated on neutral sucrose gradients. Analysis of the double-stranded DNA synthesized by using oligo(dT) primer showed the plus strands to be about 5 to 6 kb long, whereas the plus strands synthesized by using DNase-digested calf thymus DNA primers were only 0.3 to 0.5 kb long. Double-stranded DNA synthesized by either method has an average size of 6 x 10(6) daltons. Double-stranded DNA was also synthesized by using cDNA transcripts as templates without the addition of any primers.

With cDNAtotal as a probe, these transforming viruses were shown to vary in their representation of helper sequences (15 to 60% hybridization of cDNAtotal).

FeLV-A was recovered from the plasma first, in a high proportion of the cats, and FeLV-B appeared later but not in all cats.

Two groups of age-matched nonthymectomized cats were inoculated with the same FeLV-R stock. Thymectomy prior to FeLV infection had no influence on the induction of viremia or the incidence of lymphosarcoma. In the FeLV-inoculated nonthymectomized cats, lymphosarcoma developed in the thymus. In the thymectomized cats, lymphosarcoma developed in the intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, and bone marrow, but the malignant lymphoblasts had surface markers characteristic of feline T lymphocytes.

A comparison of the amino acid composition and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of REV p30 with those reported for several mammalian retrovirus p30s shows remarkable similarities. Both REV and mammalian p30s contain a large number of polar residues in their amino acid composition and show approximately 40% homology in the first 30 NH2-terminal amino acids. No crossreactivity could be observed, however, in competition radioimmunoassays between Rauscher murine leukemia virus p30 and that of REV. The observations reported here suggest a close evolutionary relationship between REV and the mammalian retroviruses.",,PMC392632,,,

The active immunogen used consisted of a sarcoma virus pseudotype of Rad LV which induces regressing sarcomas in young adult mice. These immunized animals were challenged with four weekly 160-rad X-ray exposures. The appearance of lymphomas and leukemias resulting from such irradiation was delayed and their incidence significantly decreased. These results indicate that oncornavirus immunization may be used to reduce the incidence of murine leukemias which are triggered by a physical agent.,,,,,

Incorporation of ATP into acid-precipitable products is dependendent on the presence of Mn2+ or Mg2+ and of an RNA primer. The reaction is specific for ATP as the substrate (KM=290 290 micron, it is not inhibited by actinomycin D and only slightly interferred with by ethidium bromide. Cordycepin 5'-triphosphate and sodium pyrophosphate inhibit the enzyme activity. The chain length of the products of the reaction is dependent on the primer concentration and reaches up to 30 nucleotides. Poly(A) polymerase activity is low in resting (G1 phase) cells 75 nmol ATP incorporated/h per 10(6) cells) and increases to a level about twice as high in early S phase of the cell cycle. A possible model for regulation of enzyme activity is discussed. Polymerase activity in the early phase of erythropoietic differentiation of the cells induced by butyric acid does not show any difference in comparison to untreated controls. A decrease in enzyme activity to levels characteristic for cells in G1 phase accompanies shutdown of cell growth in the course of the ongoing differentiation. Analysis of the DNA content of the cells revealed that erythropoietic differentiation of Friend cells induced by butyric acid is characterized by arrest of the cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Poly(A) polymerase activity in erythroleukemic cells is thus controlled only by the phase of the cell cycle; it is not affected by changes in gene expression during erythroid differentiation.",,,,,

The rat cell line was obtained by transferring the FBJ-MuSV genome to normal rat kidney cells in the absence of the FBJ type C virus (FBJ-MuLV), which, usually in high concentration, accompanies the FBJ-MuSV. Both transformed hamster and rat cell lines contain the FBJ-MuSV genome, which can be rescued by ecotropic and xenotropic murine type C viruses. This rescued genome produces characteristic FBJ-MuSV foci in tissue culture and, in appropriate animal hosts, induces osteosarcomas typical of those induced by FBJ-MuSV. FBJ-MuSV was isolated originally from a parosteal osteosarcoma that occurred naturally in a mouse.

Maps of gp70 from cultured cells infected with ecotropic and xenotropic viruses were distinguishable from one another, and in general resembled gp70 maps prepared directly from ecotropic and xenotropic virions respectively. Maps of gp70s immunoprecipitated from thymocytes of five mouse strains and from two A strain T-cell leukemias also fell into two distinguishable and generally corresponding patterns. Thus peptide-mapping substantiates earlier conclusions that viral gp70s and plasma-membrane gp70s inherited independently of virus-production are highly related or identical molecules. The gp70 maps of thymocytes from B6, B6-G(+IX), 129, and A mice formed a group resembling the map from cultured cells infected with xenotropic virus. Thymocytes from AKR mice, and the two A strain leukemias, gave gp70 maps conforming more to the second pattern, that of cultured cells infected with ecotropic virus. This second pattern probably comprises at least two gp70 types, one of which is X-gp70.

The lymphoma, which was produced by transplanting subcutaneously neoplastic lymphocytes that had proliferated at subcutaneous sites of cell implantation, was characterized by localization and favorable prognosis. Evidence indicates that the tissue environment the neoplastic lymphocytes encounter during circulation and/or proliferation regulates their subsequent behavior in the intact host.

MDHV-A, which was extracted from the feather follicle epithelium of chickens naturally infected with ALV, did not induce cytologic changes in CEF cultures, but did cause focus formation in CK cultures. ALV was detected in MDHV-A, but not in MDHV preparations. MDHV-A (reconstructed in vivo) and MDHV were further distinguished from one another by inoculation of ALV-free LSI-SPF chickens. MDHV-A elicited a high incidence of early mortality which was not accompanied by the gross tumor spectrum characteristic of Marek's disease, although extensive histologic lesions were present. The differences between MDHV and MDHV-A were not as striking in another line of ALV-free chickens (SPAFAS). By contrast, among conventional chickens with naturally occurring ALV infection, neither MDHV-A nor MDHV caused appreciable early mortality although both were highly oncogenic (gross tumor development). These observations demonstrate that the presence of an oncornavirus (ALV), detected by radioimmune but not complement fixation assays, can influence the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of an oncogenic herpesvirus (MDHV). The observations recorded here resolve some of the inconsistencies reported in the literature. Thus, the apparent failure by some to find interactions between MDHV and oncornaviruses can be ascribed to the comparatively limited sensitivity of the complement fixation assay used to detect oncornaviruses (ALV). We have shown that the presence of oncornavirus detectable by radioimmune assay, but not by complement fixation, can influence the in vitro and in vivo responses of an oncogenic herpesvirus (MDHV). Our observations relating to viral interaction do not imply that MDHV required the presence of ALV to produce disease.",,,,,

The relationship between cellular phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PP-ribose-P) metabolism and the activity of the enzymes which catalyse the early steps of de novo purine biosynthesis has been explored. It was found that hamster cells deficient in amidophosphoribosyltransferase did not accumulate PP-ribose-P as do HGPRT-deficient cells. In these model systems, an accelerated rate of de novo purine biosynthesis tended to be associated with an increase in cellular PP-ribose-P cotent, but decreases in this rate results from the reduction in the activity of amidophosphoribosyltransferase. Regulation of ammonia-dependent de novo purine biosynthesis was similar to that of glutamine-dependent purine biosynthesis.",29,,,,

Thirty chicks were tested in most combinations of strain, dilution and antibody status for a total of approximately 2000 chicks per experiment. Two subsequent experiments, with a total of more than 1900 chickens, investigated the influence of age at challenge on the resistance of strains 4, K and S to JMV-L and the objective of the sixth experiment was to determine the chromosomal sex of the tumor cells. In terms of mortality up to 16 or 17 days after inoculation, the response to challenge of day-old chicks with JMV-L did not appear to be influenced by the presence of antibody against MD related antigens but differed among strains of chickens. The estimated dose (LD50) that would kill 50% of a challenged population of Strain 4 was approximately 10,000 live JMV-L cells, while the corresponding estimates for strains 5 and K were approximately 600 cells and for strain S it was 50 cells. JMV-H and TLT were highly lethal to all four strains and all estimates of LD50 at 16 or 17 days post challenge were less than 10 cells. Resistance to JMV-L increased rapidly with age at challenge.

In the present report, the molecular mechanisms responsible for their differential expression of gag gene products have been analyzed. Three WSV RNA genomes were shown to possess sedimentation coefficients consistent with the differences demonstrated in their allotments of helper viral sequences. The WSV variant (WSV clone 9) that expressed no detectable proteins was shown to contain the largest amount of helper viral information. Moreover, there was no additive hybridization of the WLV complementary DNA probe by RNA of this WSV clone and that of a WSV clone coding for several gag gene products. These results suggest that the lack of expression of gag gene products by WSV clone 9 is not due to a major deletion of helper viral gag gene sequences. Similar levels of WLV-specific RNA were demonstrated in cells nonproductively transformed by each WSV clone, arguing that the ability to express gag gene proteins was not related to the magnitude of viral RNA transcription. Taken together, the results are most consistent with a mechanism by which small deletions or point mutations in the genomes of some WSV variants result in premature termination of translation or synthesis of immunologically nonreactive gag gene proteins. The present findings have implications concerning the effects of evolutionary selective pressures on helper viral genetic information in mammalian transforming viruses.",,PMC353958,,,

The two assay methods were used to measure antibodies to varicella-zoster virus in 265 sera obtained from patients of different ages as well as sera from 26 patients with leukemia. There were 35 cases where antibodies were detected by immune adherence hemagglutination but not by complement fixation, whereas in five cases the converse was found.

One of these lines, M-138, produced large quantities of virus, permitting the isolation of milligram quantities of B-tropic MuLV. Neonatal BALB/c mice injected with the M-138 MuLV developed high plasma levels of the species-specific virion antigen p30, but during 9 months of observation failed to manifest clinical signs of leukemia. Plasma p30 levels of NIH Swiss mice (non-permissive host) that were inoculated also as neonates with the same virus preparation, remained undetectable by radioimmunoassay.

All virus-free strains so far tested were tumor-susceptible, while AKR was resistant. The selectivity of MSV tumor resistance, characteristic of AKR mice, was associated with AKR virogens segregation in first backcross to MuLV-negative/MSV-susceptible mice, and in a few second backcross families. Stronger evidence that AKR ecotropic virogene expression is the major, but not the sole, determinant of M-MSV tumor resistance in AKR mice was obtained in strains partially congeneic for akv-2 viral gene and in recombinant inbred lines derived from an original cross between AKR and C57L mice. These mice or lines, in which inheritance of endogenous viral genes had occurred, at the same time inherited the ability to show strong resistance to tumor induction by an exogenous oncogenic virus. This finding suggests that ecotropic endogenous viruses can exert a beneficial effect in their hosts providing some protective functions. Although the association between AKR-MuLV and M-MSV resistance is definite, the mechanisms by which MuLV+ mice are refractory to M-MSV tumors have still to be elucidated.",,,,,

Quantitative myeloperoxidase measurement revealed an overall deficiency of this enzyme in MM neutrophils and a highly significant correlation between low myeloperoxidase levels and impaired candidacidal activity. Neutrophils from patients with myeloid metaplasia show a pattern of defective microbial killing, high alkaline phosphatase activity and low myeloperoxidase activty which is similar to that seen in severe infections and distinct from chronic granulocytic leukaemia. The cells of one patient with particularly low myeloperoxidase and defective microbial killing were further studied both cytochemically and by electron microscopy.

U.S.A. 74: 2370-2374). In contrast to these findings, globin synthesis persists in Friend erythroleukemia cells infected with VSV. Physical measurements of the size of bulk-infected cell mRNA, using hybridization with polyuridylic acid, demonstrated that there was no detectable change in the size of mRNA's after infection with VSV. A comparison of the kinetics of hybridization of cytoplasmic RNA extracted from cells infected with either HSV or VSV with globin complementary DNA revealed that by 4 h postinfection with HSV only about 15% of the globin mRNA sequences remained, whereas there was no discernible change in the sequence abundance of globin mRNA in VSV-infected cells.",,PMC353941,,,

The RNAs extracted from both clone 3 and clone 124-5R of Moloney sarcoma-leukemia virus complex contained some large monomer subunits ca. 10,000 nucleotides in length (10 kilobases), which are believed to be the Moloney leukemia virus subunits. Both RNAs had an excess of a smaller, sarcoma-specific subunit, 5 kilobases (clone 3) or 6 kilobases (clone 124-5R) in length. Electron microscopy of intact 50 to 70S dimer RNA molecules showed for both clones many dimers of two small subunits, some dimers of two large subunits, but few if any heterodimers with one large and one small subunit. This result was unexpected because the sequences near the 5'end of the RNA subunits, which are believed to be involved in the dimer linkage, are probably homologous between the large and small subunits. We also observed that some small-small dimers migrated anomalously slowly on nondenaturing gels. The nature of this slow-migrating complex is unkown; it could be a higher aggregate of the small-small dimer with additional small or large subunits, or it could be an extended conformation of the small-small dimer.",,PMC353936,,,

The rat genetic sequences started at this point and extended all the way to the very 5' end of the RNA molecules, where a small stretch of Ki-MuLV sequence was detected. By comparison of the fingerprints of Ki-SV RNA and the RNA of the endogenous rat src genetic sequences, it was found that more than 50% of the T1 oligonucleotides were similar between Ki-SV and the endogenous rat src RNA, suggesting an identical primary nucleotide sequence in over 50% of the viral genomes.

No virus growth was detected in cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (9), acute lymphocytic leukemia (1), or lymphosarcoma cell leukemia (2), HSV replication did occur in hairy cell leukemic MNL from all of 4 patients studied. Maximal titers of 10(3.7) to 10(4.7) PFU/ml occurred 1 to 7 days after incubation. By electron microscopy, herpesvirus particles were seen in the nuclei of these infected cells after 3 days of culture, but none was seen in the cells not exposed to virus. Fluorescent antibody examination confirmed the presence of HSV antigens in the nuclei of infected hairy cells. No difference in the adsorption or penetration of the virus was found with the various MNL studied.

Exposure of virions to filipin resulted in a series of depressions and ridges in the envelope of VS virions, with a periodicity of 15 to 20 nm perpendicular to the long axis of the particle; similar morphological alterations were observed in negatively stained preparations, in thin-sectioned virions, and in protease-treated virions that lack surface glycoproteins. This morphological effect was specific for filipin, since the envelopes of VS virions that had been treated with another polyene antibiotic, amphotericin B, exhibited markedly different morphology. Morphological alterations induced by filipin in influenza and Rauscher leukemia virions differed from those seen in VS virions. The infectivity of filipin-treated VS virions was reduced up to 500-fold, whereas influenza virions were resistant to filipin treatment. Incorporation of filipin into the virions was demonstrated, and no release of either lipids or proteins from virions was detected after filipin treatment. A stoichiometry of approximately 1 mol of bound filipin per mol of cholesterol was found in both intact and protease-treated VS virions. The equilibrium dissociation constant for filipin-cholesterol interaction was approximately 74-fold larger in intact than in protease-treated VS virions.

Three polyanions increased the net outer cell charge, while only one of four inhibited infectivity and two of three impeded syncytia formation. Polyions had a slight, probably toxic, effect on the transmembrane potential, independent of their charge. Cells treated with fluorescent DEAE-dextran showed diffuse staining, which 4 h later had been modified into a granular fluorescence with unstained areas now present. This change correlated with a loss of enhancement of viral infectivity. The only polyanion which inhibited viral infectivity had a strong antihyaluronidase activity, and hyaluronidase and Ca++ both increased viral infectivity. It is suggested, therefore, that polyions may in part work on virus-cell membrane interactions by influencing membrane enzymes and not necessarily by simply changing the net outer cell surface charge.",,,,,

Macrophages have been reported to be intimately involved in host-tumor relationships, and were therefore examined for their role in reversing suppression in two leukemia virus-induced tumor models. In vivo studies with the Friend leukemia virus (FL virus) were unsuccessful in demonstrating any role for stimulated peritoneal exudate (PE) cells, rich in macrophages, in restoration of antibody function in leukemic mice. However, in vitro studies with FL virus demonstrated that proteose-peptone stimulated PE cells from normal syngeneic mice in restricted numbers (1-3 x 10(5)), when added to 5 x 10(6) FL virus infected spleen cells, could partially restore immunity. Furthermore, using the Rowson-Parr virus (RP virus) model system it was shown that PE cells from RP virus-infected mice, as well as normal PE cells, were capable of restoring immunocompetence. Neither splenic adherent cells nor lymphoid cells from other tissues, when added to RP virus-infected spleen cells, were able to induce recovery of the immune response. In addition, treatment with antitheta serum plus complement had no effect on the ability of PE cells to restore immunity, implying that macrophages were solely responsible for reversal of immunosuppression. An alteration of antigen ""processing"" or ""focusing"" may be an important mechanism by which recovery of immune competence is achieved.",24,,,,

Attempts were made to serially transplant JBL cells in antilymphocyte serum-treated newborn hamsters; intraperitoneal implantation of 1-3 X 10(7) cells gave rise to invasive tumors in all recipients with death after 10 to 14 days. The hamster-passage line, now in the 9th passage, has been converted to an ascitic form with progression to leukemia in some animals. A ""starry sky"" pattern closely resembling the human tumor material was preserved in every tumor through serial animal passage.",,,,,
