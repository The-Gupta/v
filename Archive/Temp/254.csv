No statistically significant correlation could be found between the development of acute toxicity (mucositis) and the number or type of abnormal pretreatment liver functions. Patients receiving full doses of doxorubicin with mild hepatic dysfunction as determined by bromsulphalein (BSP) retention and serum liver function studies had the same incidence of toxicity and complete response rate as those with normal hepatic function. There was no significant difference between duration of response (P = 0.41) or survival (P = 0.17) between the two groups. Ten patients receiving a decreased dose of doxorubicin due to hepatic dysfunction had the same complete response rate but a lower incidence of toxicity as patients receiving full doxorubicin dose. Pharmacokinetic data from fluorescence plasma assays suggest no difference among patients with normal or mildly abnormal liver function studies receiving full doxorubicin doses. The results suggest that leukemia patients with mild hepatic dysfunction receiving a combination of full-dose doxorubicin and cytosine arabinoside for acute leukemia will have the same plasma pharmacokinetics, incidence of toxicity, and complete response rate as those with normal hepatic function. Reduction of doxorubicin dose in patients with abnormal liver function tests results in lower plasma concentrations, less toxicity, and the same response rate, but may also yield a shorter duration of response and survival.","['Brenner, D E', 'Wiernik, P H', 'Wesley, M', 'Bachur, N R']","['Brenner DE', 'Wiernik PH', 'Wesley M', 'Bachur NR']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Liver/*physiopathology', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19840301)53:5<1042::aid-cncr2820530505>3.0.co;2-b [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1984 Mar 1;53(5):1042-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19840301)53:5<1042::aid-cncr2820530505>3.0.co;2-b.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,

Blast cells from the peripheral blood or bone marrow of adult patients presenting with different forms of acute leukemia were analyzed for in vitro responsiveness to anticancer drugs in terms of suppression of 3H-uridine incorporation into cellular nucleic acids. The following agents were tested over a wide range of concentrations: Adriamycin, cytosine arabinoside, thioguanine, 6-mercaptopurine, prednisone, and 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide. Retrospectively, the in vitro data were compared to the clinical response of the patients to polychemotherapy. In the majority of the patients, in vitro cytotoxic effectiveness of Adriamycin (doxorubicin) and cytosine arabinoside reflected the in vivo situation. The levels of in vitro inhibition that could distinguish between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant diseases appeared to be 30% for Adriamycin and 20% for cytosine arabinoside. No correlation was found between the Adriamycin effect in vitro and the proliferative state (rate of 3H-thymidine incorporation) of the leukemic cell population. Serial in vitro sensitivity testing during the course of disease of various patients proved the ability of the test system to detect acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, the assay might serve as a reliable tool in the selection of effective chemotherapy in individual patients suffering from acute leukemia.","['Schwarzmeier, J D', 'Paietta, E', 'Mittermayer, K', 'Pirker, R']","['Schwarzmeier JD', 'Paietta E', 'Mittermayer K', 'Pirker R']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Time Factors']",1984/02/01 00:00,1984/02/01 00:01,['1984/02/01 00:00'],"['1984/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19840201)53:3<390::aid-cncr2820530304>3.0.co;2-o [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1984 Feb 1;53(3):390-5. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19840201)53:3<390::aid-cncr2820530304>3.0.co;2-o.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,

We noted that blast cells in the peripheral blood of acute nonlymphoid leukemia patients treated with the drug Harringtonine appeared to undergo morphological changes that suggested differentiation. In view of the relatively minimal myelotoxicity of Harringtonine, we hypothesized that harringtonine was acting by differentiation-induction, which concomitantly arrested cell division. We tested this hypothesis using two different experimental approaches. First, the promyelocytic leukemic cell line, HL-60, was cultured with Harringtonine and shown to differentiate into a cell, which, by functional cell surface marker and morphological criteria, closely resembled normal monocytes. Furthermore, these changes were accompanied, and indeed slightly preceded by, loss of proliferative capacity. Second, to prove that the leukemic blasts were the cells undergoing the changes observed in vivo, freshly isolated leukemia cell populations were cultured with Harringtonine, and morphological changes paralleling those seen in the patients were observed. Thus, the antileukemic effect of Harringtonine appeared to be due to diversion of the proliferating blast cells into a differentiation pathway, which, as in normal myeloid cells, resulted in the arrest of proliferation.","['Boyd, A W', 'Sullivan, J R']","['Boyd AW', 'Sullivan JR']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Alkaloids/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Harringtonines/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Thioguanine/therapeutic use']",1984/02/01 00:00,1984/02/01 00:01,['1984/02/01 00:00'],"['1984/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85418-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Feb;63(2):384-92.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",,,,

Specifically, the Moloney murine sarcoma virus sequence significantly enhances the level of gene expression at both 5' and 3' locations and in either orientation relative to the test gene. It is able to enhance gene activity both from its own promoter and from a heterologous (simian virus 40) promoter. The 73/72-base-pair subunits of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus enhancer differ in sequence by four nucleotides and also in the strength of their enhancer function. The promoter distal A repeat is at least three times as active as the promoter proximal B repeat in enhancing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression. Results of these studies also show that the enhancer sequence alone is unable to induce gene activity but requires other promoter elements, including a proximal GC-rich sequence and the Goldberg-Hogness box.","['Laimins, L A', 'Gruss, P', 'Pozzatti, R', 'Khoury, G']","['Laimins LA', 'Gruss P', 'Pozzatti R', 'Khoury G']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Defective Viruses/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Operon', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.49.1.183-189.1984 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1984 Jan;49(1):183-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.49.1.183-189.1984.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",PMC255440,,,

The murine WEHI 164 sarcoma was selected for analysis of drug-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (DDCC) because high levels of killing were detected with this tumor, and it was considerably resistant to natural killer (NK) cell activity. Optimal conditions for induction of susceptibility to lysis included a 3-hr preincubation with 1 microgram/ml Act D. Effector cells of cytotoxicity against Act D-treated WEHI 164 cells were plastic adherent (greater than 85% monocytes). Cells nonadherent to plastic and nylon wool (less than or equal to 1% monocytes) had no appreciable DDCC activity. In contrast NK activity against K562 cells was mediated by nonadherent cells. When PBM were fractionated on a one step discontinuous gradient of Percoll designed to enrich for monocytes (greater than 90% pure), DDCC activity was found in the monocyte fraction, and the lymphoid cell-enriched fraction had no cytotoxicity against Act D-treated WEHI 164 cells. In contrast, NK activity against K562 was recovered with lymphoid cells, and monocytes had no NK cytotoxicity. Upon fractionation on a six step Percoll gradient designed to enrich for large granular lymphocytes (LGL), the denser lymphocytes (fraction 4-6) and the less dense LGL with NK activity (fraction 2-3) had no cytotoxicity against Act D-treated WEHI 164 sarcoma cells. DDCC activity sedimented in fraction 1 in association with monocytes. PBM were fractionated according to monoclonal antibody-defined surface markers by using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Effector cells of DDCC were positive for monocyte markers (Mo2, UCHM1) and were negative for NK cell (B73.1, HNK1), T cell (T11), and B cell (Leu-10) markers. Macrophages obtained by culturing blood monocytes in vitro for 5 to 10 days had DDCC activity. Similarly, peritoneal and bronchoalveolar macrophages had considerable cytotoxicity against Act D-treated target cells, whereas minimal or no NK activity was found at these anatomic sites. Cells of human or murine origin, preincubated with Act D for 3 hr, were heterogeneous in their susceptibility to monocyte killing in a 6-hr 51Cr-release assay. High levels of cytotoxicity were observed with the murine WEHI 164 sarcoma and 3T3 ""fibroblast"" line and with the human CEM leukemia.

Recently, we reported that cytosols of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) cells contained high levels of mero-receptor complexes relative to those of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or normal lymphoid cells. In the present study, we examined the cause for the lability of cytosolic complexes of ANLL cells. Mero-receptor accumulated rapidly in ANLL cytosols in a time-dependent fashion. The accumulation was most rapid in cytosols which contained activated receptor complexes, but it also occurred in cytosols containing only nonactivated receptor forms. Molybdate (20 mM) slowed but did not prevent the conversion to mero-receptor. Cytosols of ANLL specimens of the M4 French-American-British class (with monocytoid differentiation properties), in general, contained more stable complexes than did specimens of the M1 to M3 French-American-British classes (primarily myelocytic differentiation) suggesting that lability may in part be related to the state or direction of differentiation of the leukemic cells. In keeping with this hypothesis, cytosols of polymorphonuclear cells isolated from normal blood were much more labile than were those of monocytes. Mixing experiments with ANLL and CLL cells showed that the lability of ANLL complexes is not due simply to a higher content of proteolytic enzymes in these cells, because addition of ANLL cells or cytosols to CLL specimens did not result in increased mero-receptor. To the contrary, addition of CLL cells to ANLL specimens greatly stabilized the cytosolic complexes. These findings indicate the presence of an endogenous factor, present in CLL but lacking in ANLL cells, which is capable of stabilizing cytosolic complexes.","['Holbrook, N J', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Munck, A']","['Holbrook NJ', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Munck A']",['eng'],"['AM-03535/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26273/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*metabolism', 'Drug Stability', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/*metabolism', 'Triamcinolone Acetonide/*metabolism']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Jan;44(1):407-14.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'F446C597KA (Triamcinolone Acetonide)']",,,,

We measured natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity (51Chromium released) in 79 normal individuals using K562 leukemia cells as targets in quadruplicate assays after 3, 4, and 5 hr of incubation using three different effector:target cell ratios (6.2:1, 25:1, and 50:1). Natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity was significantly lower (p less than 0.005) in each of the nine separate assay conditions for individuals with a high familial incidence of cancer compared to individuals with a low incidence of cancer. Moreover, natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity inversely correlated with the number of family members with cancer. The relationship between high familial cancer incidence and low natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity was observed in males as well as in females and in nonsmokers as well as in smokers.

Recent clinical studies suggest a relationship between high AHH activity and lung cancer associated with cigarette smoking (Kouri, R.E., McKinney, C.E., Slomiany, D.J., Snodgrass, D.R., Wray, N.P., and McLemore, T.L. Cancer Res. 42: 5030-5037, 1982). To determine whether there is a similar genetic relationship in humans between inducible AHH and the occurrence of pediatric cancers, we examined AHH activity in mitogen-stimulated benzo(a)anthracene-treated lymphocyte cultures from primary relatives of children with leukemia or solid tumors. Control families (parents and siblings with no history of cancer) comprised friends or neighbors of the proband families. By comparing variance among family members with variance among nonrelated individuals, we conclude that a small, but real, genetic component is detectable. Adjusting for age, smoking history, and the length of time during which the lymphocytes had been cryopreserved, however, we find no difference among 77 leukemia, 71 solid tumor, and 100 control family members with regard to median units (+/- median S.E.) of maximally induced AHH activity per unit of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-cytochrome c reductase activity: 0.31 +/- 0.03; 0.28 +/- 0.03; and 0.28 +/- 0.03, respectively. Thus, benzo(a)anthracene-induced AHH activity in cultured mitogen-activated lymphocytes in our study population does not appear to be associated with the risk of occurrence of childhood leukemia or solid tumors.","['Levine, A S', 'McKinney, C E', 'Echelberger, C K', 'Kouri, R E', 'Edwards, B K', 'Nebert, D W']","['Levine AS', 'McKinney CE', 'Echelberger CK', 'Kouri RE', 'Edwards BK', 'Nebert DW']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'DNA Replication', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Jan;44(1):358-62.,['EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)'],,,,

In each case, influx was characterized by a single saturable component with an approach to steady-state conforming to a single exponential, while efflux was first order (poorly saturable). Both mediated fluxes exhibited high temperature dependence (Q10 27-37 degrees = 6 to 8). During competition studies with various analogues, it was found that positions 4, 5, 7, and 10 and the gamma-carboxyl position of the folate molecule were specified for influx in tumor cells from each species. Also, short-chain alkyl substitution at position 10 was specified in the case of N10, but not in the case of C10. None of the modifications at position 10 affected mediated efflux in either cell type. The linkage of additional glutamyl residues at the gamma-carboxyl-position resulted in reduced saturability (increased value for Ki) of influx in both murine and human tumor cells in a manner proportional to the number of glutamyl residues. Mediated influx in human ovarian carcinoma cells obtained from malignant effusions in several patients and in an established cell line derived from one of these patients showed similar kinetics for folate analogue transport and specificity for modification at position 10 of the 4-amino-folate molecule. Mediated entry of 10-deazaaminopterin and its 10-ethyl derivative compared to entry of methotrexate was 4- to 11-fold greater in murine tumor cells and 4- to 9-fold greater in human tumor cells in culture or when clinically derived. Mediated efflux was not specified for position 10 on the 4-amino folate structure in any tumor cell type.

At noninhibitory concentrations, perhexiline maleate markedly increased the sensitivity of P388/ADR cells to doxorubicin but did not have such an effect on anthracycline-sensitive cells. The effects of perhexiline maleate on P388/ADR cells were reversible. Perhexiline maleate also increased the accumulation of another anthracycline, daunorubicin, in P388/ADR cells but did not increase its accumulation in the anthracycline-sensitive cells. Perhexiline maleate did not affect the sensitivity of either cell line to methotrexate or to 6-mercaptopurine. However, its effects on the sensitivity and on drug accumulation of vinblastine, a drug to which P388/ADR cells are cross-resistant, were similar to those observed for the anthracyclines.

The homologue competition profiles were relatively the same for [3H]putrescine, [3H]spermidine, or [3H]spermine, suggesting that all three polyamines utilize the same transport system. This was further substantiated by uptake kinetic plots which showed that the three polyamines were competitive inhibitors of one another.

Fractionation of cells was performed by a four-step procedure, comprised of density gradient centrifugation and velocity sedimentation at unit gravity in specially designed separation chambers.

Surface glycopeptides of the various myeloid cells were investigated by gel filtration analysis after metabolic labeling with radioactive fucose or after external labeling with periodate-borotritide under mild conditions.

Among the agents so far tested, only a comparative few occur naturally in vertebrates and would appear to have significant clinical potential in the treatment of leukaemic patients. One of the most promising of these is the dihydroxymetabolite of vitamin D3, 1,25(OH)2D3. This compound circulates in normal man and has a major role in calcium homeostasis. Moreover, it has recently been reported that 1,25(OH)2D3 increases the survival time of mice injected with myeloid leukaemia cells. We and McCarthy et al. have previously shown that HL-60 cells respond to near physiological levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 by rapidly acquiring a number of monocyte-like features. Here we document that these phenotypic changes are preceded by a marked decrement in the expression of the c-myc oncogene. In fact, the diminution in the level of c-myc mRNA parallels the dose dependency and metabolite specificity shown by the various other indicators of phenotypic change. In addition, we demonstrate that removal of vitamin D3, after the onset of maturational change, results in the reappearance of elevated myc mRNA levels. We believe this to be the first demonstration of a sequential relationship between the application of an exogenous inducing agent, a reduction in myc mRNA levels and the development of characteristics associated with normal cell maturation.","['Reitsma, P H', 'Rothberg, P G', 'Astrin, S M', 'Trial, J', 'Bar-Shavit, Z', 'Hall, A', 'Teitelbaum, S L', 'Kahn, A J']","['Reitsma PH', 'Rothberg PG', 'Astrin SM', 'Trial J', 'Bar-Shavit Z', 'Hall A', 'Teitelbaum SL', 'Kahn AJ']",['eng'],"['CA-27797/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE-04629/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'DE-05413/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Esterases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/immunology', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Muramidase/metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/306492a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1983 Dec 1-7;306(5942):492-4. doi: 10.1038/306492a0.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,

Anilino ring geometry of amsacrine and derivatives: relationship to DNA binding and antitumor activity.,1625-30,"The clinical antileukemic drug amsacrine and analogues are thought to exert their biological activity by binding tightly but reversibly to DNA, with the acridine chromophore intercalated and the anilino group making additional binding contact in the minor groove of the double helix. In this binding model the steric environment around the 3'- and 5'-positions of the anilino ring is crucial. Two 3',5'-disubstituted analogues of amsacrine have been prepared, and their conformation, DNA binding properties, and antitumor activity were determined and compared with corresponding unsubstituted and 3'-substituted compounds. Addition of 3'- and 3',5'-substituents have little effect on minimum-energy conformations of the anilino side chain but have significant effects on DNA binding and biological activity. Monosubstitution lowers binding constants several-fold, but intercalative binding with extensive drug-base pair overlap is retained. Disubstitution lowers binding further, and although the binding is still intercalative as assessed by unwinding angles, it appears to occur with little drug-base pair overlap, as determined by high-field NMR studies of DNA imino proton shifts. These changes in DNA binding are accompanied by an abrupt change in biological activity, with the 3',5'-disubstituted analogues proving inactive and nontoxic even though other physicochemical properties, such as lipophilicity and stability, remain within acceptable limits. This study provides further evidence that the binding of drugs to DNA has a critical influence on their biological activity.","['Denny, W A', 'Atwell, G J', 'Baguley, B C']","['Denny WA', 'Atwell GJ', 'Baguley BC']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['*Aminoacridines/therapeutic use', 'Amsacrine', 'Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cattle', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymus Gland']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00365a014 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1983 Nov;26(11):1625-30. doi: 10.1021/jm00365a014.,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,

The active component of the extract eluted in gel filtration at a point corresponding to a molecular weight of 800 000. During its reaction with DNA, DNA-protein links and DNA breaks appeared in approximately equal frequencies. In this respect the reaction stimulated by m-AMSA resembled the reaction of a topoisomerase with DNA. However, intercalator-stimulated formation of protein-associated DNA breaks differed from the activity of the nuclear topoisomerase I in that there was a different optimum salt concentration and a different apparent molecular weight.","['Filipski, J', 'Yin, J', 'Kohn, K W']","['Filipski J', 'Yin J', 'Kohn KW']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Aminoacridines/*pharmacology', 'Amsacrine', 'Animals', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice']",1983/10/13 00:00,1983/10/13 00:01,['1983/10/13 00:00'],"['1983/10/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/13 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4781(83)90017-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4781(83)90017-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1983 Oct 13;741(1):116-22. doi: 10.1016/0167-4781(83)90017-9.,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)']",,,,

Two cases of leukemia occurred 11 years after diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease. All nine complications were observed in the 220 patients who received MOPP combination therapy (9.1 percent risk of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia at 12 years) either with (n = 8) or without (n = 1) radiation therapy. Patients treated with MOPP with pathologic stage IV disease (37.2 percent risk of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia at 12 years) or over the age of 40 years (33.1 percent risk), and those with failure of MOPP treatment (18.0 percent risk) were in particular jeopardy. If MOPP treatment had been restricted to patients who were under the age of 40 years and with stages I, II, and III disease, it would have been possible to use the drug combination in two thirds of those who had been so treated while eliminating all but one case of leukemia. Furthermore, leukemia was not observed in 78 patients treated with six cycles of MOPP and less than total nodal irradiation. A final decision concerning optimal management of Hodgkin's disease will require definition of the leukemia incidence curve in the second decade after MOPP treatment, and acquisition of additional knowledge of the long-term efficacy and toxicity of alternate treatment regimens.","['Aisenberg, A C']",['Aisenberg AC'],['eng'],['CA 30020-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/adverse effects']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(83)90348-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(83)90348-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1983 Sep;75(3):449-54. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(83)90348-0.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'MOPP protocol']",,,,

Of the quinazolines tested, 5,8-dideazaisopteroylglutamate, (IAHQ), when administered at 85 mg/kg on days 2 and 10 after tumor implantation delayed the growth of colon tumor No. 38, and resulted in 6 of 20 tumor-free animals at 90 days. In contrast, methotrexate had no effect on the growth of colon tumor No. 38 at maximally tolerated doses. IAHQ was also active against human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HCT-8) in tissue culture, requiring a concentration of 5 X 10(-7) M to inhibit cell growth 50% after 72 hours continuous exposure. Since IAHQ was an effective substrate for folylpolyglutamate synthetase, we examined the effects of IAHQ and its possible tri-gamma-glutamyl metabolite, 5,8-dideazaisoPteGLu3, on thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase. Neither IAHQ nor 5,8-dideazaisoPteGlu3 stimulated significant binding of 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate to thymidylate synthase. This was consistent with the observation that IAHQ antagonized the killing of HCT-8 cells by 5-fluorouracil. 5,8 DideazaisoPteGlu3 bound more tightly to thymidylate synthase than dihydrofolate reductase as indicated by Kis of 0.09 and 0.7 microM when deoxyuridylate and dihydropteroylglutamate, respectively, were the variable substrates. Inhibition studies also revealed that binding of IAHQ and 5,8-dideazaisoPteGlu3 to thymidylate synthase is promoted and not antagonized by deoxyuridylate. The data suggests that the biochemical basis for the antitumor effects of IAHQ is the intracellular conversion of IAHQ to poly-gamma-glutamyl metabolites, which inhibit thymidylate synthase via formation of an inhibitor-deoxyuridylate-enzyme complex.","['Fernandes, D J', 'Cardenas, R M', 'Bertino, J R', 'Hynes, J B']","['Fernandes DJ', 'Cardenas RM', 'Bertino JR', 'Hynes JB']",['eng'],"['CA 06167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 24887/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Peptide Synthases/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/chemical synthesis/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*metabolism']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4757-5241-0_25 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1983;163:341-57. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4757-5241-0_25.,"['0 (Quinazolines)', '56239-21-5 (5,8-dideazaisofolic acid)', '85344-30-5 (5,8-dideazaisopteroyl triglutamate)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,

In this study, the effect of SAQs on the induction of cytotoxicity of asynchronous Chinese hamster cells in culture was studied and compared to those produced by ADR and dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ), a SAQ previously shown to be more effective than ADR. SAQs produced cytotoxicity that was dependent upon the concentration and duration of drug exposure. A correlation was noted between the activity of a compound (the concentration required to produce a certain level of cell kill) and the presence of a particular triangular arrangement of one nitrogen atom and two oxygen atoms. There was also a correlation between chemical structure and antitumor activity in the murine P388 leukemia model system.

The pattern of metastasis was analyzed for these 369 cases. There was no significant difference in the pattern of lymph node metastasis between the 5 groups, but there was a slight difference between seminoma and embryonal carcinoma. There was a significant difference in the pattern of distant metastasis between the 5 groups and between choriocarcinoma and seminoma, choriocarcinoma and embryonal carcinoma, and, choriocarcinoma and teratocarcinoma. It is questionable whether the findings at autopsy directly relate to prognosis, but considering from the pattern of metastasis at autopsy, the adult germinal cell testicular tumors can be divided into the three groups: seminoma, choriocarcinoma and embryonal carcinoma + teratocarcinoma + teratoma.","['Kiriyama, T', 'Yoshida, O']","['Kiriyama T', 'Yoshida O']",['jpn'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Hinyokika Kiyo,Hinyokika kiyo.

The interferons were compared on a weight basis at concentrations of 0.4 and 4.0 ng/ml (equivalent to 80 and 800 units of interferon activity for IFN-alpha A and 2.0 and 20 units for IFN-alpha D). Inhibition of tumor colony-forming units (50% of control or less) was observed in 38.1% of the 273 tumors tested against IFN-alpha A, and in 16% of the 71 tumors tested against IFN-alpha D. Of the tumor types with at least ten samples tested against IFN-alpha A, the percentage of cases exhibiting inhibition was as follows: melanoma (51.7%), lung cancer (50%), myeloma (33.4%), ovarian cancer (33.9%), sarcoma (33.3%), adenocarcinoma of unknown primary (30.4%), breast cancer (28%), acute leukemia (30.8%), and renal cancer (23%). More marked inhibition (30% of control or less) was observed in 18.7% of all tumors tested against IFN-alpha A. Of 60 melanomas tested, 18 (30%) exhibited marked in vitro inhibition of growth with IFN-alpha A. Although a smaller number of tumors (71) were tested against IFN-alpha D on a weight basis, it appeared, in general, to be slightly less active than IFN-alpha A (p less than 0.01), and only 8% of tumors tested exhibited marked inhibition over the same dosage range of interferon. Comparison of the dose-response curves for the 68 tumors tested simultaneously against both interferons did not reveal marked interpatient differences in the inhibition curves, although IFN-alpha D was slightly less active overall. Tumors exhibiting at least 50% inhibition of tumor colony formation also proved to be sensitive to a significantly larger number of cytotoxic drugs (tested simultaneously) than the tumors not inhibited with interferon (p less than 0.0001 for IFN-alpha A). We conclude that the in vitro clonogenic assay may aid in targeting tumor types most likely to exhibit interferon sensitivity and assist in case selection for entry into clinical trials with cloned interferons.","['Salmon, S E', 'Durie, B G', 'Young, L', 'Liu, R M', 'Trown, P W', 'Stebbing, N']","['Salmon SE', 'Durie BG', 'Young L', 'Liu RM', 'Trown PW', 'Stebbing N']",['eng'],"['CA-17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology/therapy', 'Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1983.1.3.217 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1983 Mar;1(3):217-25. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1983.1.3.217.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon Type I)']",,,,

To rule out a possible decrease in cisplatin antitumor activity by a direct effect of short-term glucocorticosteroid treatment, survival was studied in mice inoculated with P388 leukemia and then treated with cisplatin preceded by a single high dose (1.5 mg/kg) of dexamethasone (Dex). The median survival of animals treated with cisplatin-Dex was 19 days, and that of animals treated with cisplatin alone was 18 days. These survival durations were significantly longer (P less than 0.01) than the survival time of the controls (median, 12 days). A double-layer soft agar clonogenic assay was used to study the possible effect of Dex on cisplatin inhibition of tumor colony-forming units from two human tumor cell lines (HEC-1A, endometrial; and WiDr, colon). In this model, the addition of Dex to cisplatin showed no statistically significant effect.

To further study this phenomenon, membrane microviscosity of ascites P-388 tumor cells was increased by adding cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS). Unexpectedly, when modified cells were heated for 60 min at 43 degrees C in vitro and analyzed in vivo in CDF1 mice they showed an increased thermal sensitivity. Similar increases in cell membrane microviscosity were obtained with V-79 cells. However, after heat treatment no differences in survival in vitro were noted between modified and unmodified cells. Treatment with CHS alone results in a substantial increase in P-388 cells, which take up trypan blue, but not in V-79 cells. When these 'dead' cells are accounted for, the difference in killing between control and CHS-modified P-388 cells is no longer seen.

When administered as a single i.p. injection of 17.5 mg/kg, adriamycin produced death in all mice within 12 days after treatment, with a mean survival time of 5-9 days. In contrast, the mean survival time of mice administered adenosine subcutaneously (200 mg/kg) in addition to adriamycin was significantly increased compared to adriamycin-treated mice. The protection elicited by adenosine was apparently not a generalized phenomenon of purines, however, since neither hypoxanthine nor inosine were effective protectants. Although a number of adenosine treatment schedules were tested, it was found that adenosine given immediately after adriamycin was as effective as multiple adenosine injections. Administration of adenosine had no apparent effect on adriamycin-mediated changes in ventricular weight, leukocyte count, elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) activity or in the histopathologic changes observed in selected tissues. Two grossly observable effects of adenosine administration were lethargy and peripheral hypothermia, which were first noticed approximately 15 min after adenosine administration and which lasted for up to 2 hr.

They are highly active against both i.p.- and i.c.-implanted ara-C-sensitive lymphoid leukemia in mice, exceeding the activity produced by the parent drug, ara-C. For example, corticosterone-p-ara-C exhibited the respective ILS values of 306% at 50 mg/kg/day X 9 and 294% at 75 mg/kg/day X 9 on survivals of i.p.- and i.c.-inoculated L1210 leukemic mice.

The 9-day continuous treatments showed a better therapeutic effectiveness than those with either a 5-day, a single or a widely spaced (q 4d., 1, 5, 9) treatment. However, they were found to be marginally effective against i.p.-implanted ara-C-resistant L1210 leukemia in mice.

Labeled cisplatin and its aquated derivatives were resolved by high-performance liquid chromatography on a strong cationic exchange column. After 10 min of incubation of cisplatin with the cells, the major portion of the non-protein-bound platinum was in the form of cisplatin. However, a portion of this platinum was converted with time to a derivative which coeluted with the monoaquo derivative of cisplatin. With the appearance of this derivative, there was a concomitant inhibition of sodium-dependent amino acid transport as measured by the uptake of aminoisobutyric acid and methionine. Furthermore, the exposure of L1210 cells to a preparation of predominantly aquated product(s) of cisplatin inhibited amino acid uptake following a brief (2-min) incubation, whereas measurable inhibition of amino acid uptake by cisplatin required a longer preincubation period. This inhibition of aminoisobutyric acid and methionine was dependent on the concentration of platinum. Aminoisobutyric acid and methionine were shown to be concentrated in L1210 cells in the presence of sodium ions, and competition experiments suggest similar uptake systems. Since L1210 cells are methionine-auxotrophic leukemic cells, inhibition of essential amino acid transport by cisplatin may be a mechanism of cytotoxic action.","['Scanlon, K J', 'Safirstein, R L', 'Thies, H', 'Gross, R B', 'Waxman, S', 'Guttenplan, J B']","['Scanlon KJ', 'Safirstein RL', 'Thies H', 'Gross RB', 'Waxman S', 'Guttenplan JB']",['eng'],"['AM-16690/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 19,023/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28,683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Aminoisobutyric Acids/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methionine/*metabolism', 'Mice']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Sep;43(9):4211-5.,"['0 (Aminoisobutyric Acids)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,

Tumors high in plasminogen activator included the B16 and colon 26. The Lewis lung and M5076 carcinoma showed an intermediate level of activity, while the plasminogen activator activity in the L1210 leukemia and colon 38 was barely elevated above background. The specific activity of the enzyme (per micrograms protein) in extracts of B16 and colon 26 was three or four times higher than in the most active normal organs surveyed (kidney, lung, brain and intestine). The high level of plasminogen activator activity measured in extracts of the B16 tumor was reflected in a substantial elevation of the levels of fibrin degradation products in the serum of mice carrying this tumor. This result suggests that the tumor-associated plasminogen activator activity is less subject to inhibitory controls in vivo than is the plasminogen activator of most normal tissues, since the total mass of the tumor was far less than the total mass of the fibrinolytically active tissues, and yet the bulk of the fibrin degradation products were caused by the tumor. We conclude that the high levels of plasminogen activator activity which are observed in many human tumors are found only in some of the transplantable murine tumors. Since this enzyme is active at an increased level in vivo in mice carrying the B16 tumor, plasminogen activator may be a suitable target for selective, enzyme-activated chemotherapy with this tumor test system.","['Bruesch, M R', 'Johnson, G L', 'Palackdharry, C S', 'Weber, M J', 'Carl, P L']","['Bruesch MR', 'Johnson GL', 'Palackdharry CS', 'Weber MJ', 'Carl PL']",['eng'],"['CA 00092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 12467/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23498/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products/analysis', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Plasminogen Activators/*analysis']",1983/07/15 00:00,1983/07/15 00:01,['1983/07/15 00:00'],"['1983/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910320119 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1983 Jul 15;32(1):121-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910320119.,"['0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)']",,,,

The results indicated that the slope and shoulder of the survival curves were greatly modified by the treatment with misonidazole. The dose-modifying factor in terms of the D0 ratio between the drug-treated and untreated control cells was increased as the drug concentration was increased. Further, it was revealed that the isoeffect dose ratios, estimated by the linear quadratic equation of Chadwick and Leenhouts, were higher at a low-radiation dose range. This is due to the suppression of the shoulder region of survival curves for the drug-treated cells.

The purpose of the present investigation was to test the hypothesis that unbalanced cell growth results from a disassociation of cell growth and cell division due to the blocking effect of chemotherapeutic agents. Monolayer cultures of CHO fibroblasts were studied in terms of their response to two chemotherapeutic agents that differ significantly in their mode of action, adriamycin and chlorambucil. Following exposure to these drugs, cell volume increased at a rate of from 1% to 4% per h; the total cell protein increased at a rate of from 4% to 7% per h. These changes were observed in both log and stationary phase cultures. Thus exposure to adriamycin and chlorambucil was followed by a more rapid rate of protein synthesis relative to the rate of degradation, resulting in larger cells with more protein whether or not the cells were actively in the division cycle. This is inconsistent with the hypothesis that unbalanced growth results simply from a disassociation of the cell division cycle from cell growth. These observations suggest that a final common pathway in the mode of action of chemotherapeutic agents may be the induction of unscheduled protein synthesis resulting in unbalanced cell growth.","['Ross, D W']",['Ross DW'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Ovary/cytology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Blood Cells. 1983;9(1):57-68.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,

Freshly isolated human monocytes caused 40% specific lysis of antibody-coated K-562 cells (Ab-K-562). Monocytes challenged with Ab-K-562 gave a small but definite luminol-dependent chemiluminescence response, indicating that a respiratory burst with generation of toxic oxygen species had been elicited. Generation of hydrogen peroxide in areas of close apposition between the monocyte and the Ab-K-562 plasma membranes was demonstrated by electron microscopy using precipitation of cerium ions as a cytochemical stain for hydrogen peroxide. Catalase inhibited the formation of cerium precipitates in the interaction zone between monocytes and Ab-K-562 cells. Despite evidence that toxic oxygen species were generated, the monocytes' cytolytic activity against Ab-K-562 was not inhibited by superoxide dismutase, catalase, or azide. Enzymatically generated fluxes of superoxide anion or hydrogen peroxide were not cytolytic to K-562 cells but did have a cytostatic effect. We conclude that toxic oxygen species are generated when human monocytes are challenged with Ab-K-562.

Lymphomagenic MCF viruses of thymic origin (AKR-247 and C58L1) were found to infect and replicate selectively in immature lymphocytes only present in thymic cortex, whereas nonlymphomagenic MCF viruses of splenic origin (C58v-1-C77 and C58v-2-C45) selectively infected and replicated in cells that appeared to B lymphocytes. Virus-binding studies suggested that neither T- nor B-lymphocyte tropisms were determined by selective attachment of virus to the respective cells. These findings demonstrate that in contrast with ecotropic viruses, which can infect many types of cells in the mouse, specific cellular tropisms can exist for MCF viruses, and that MCF infection, and therefore oncogenicity, is closely linked to cellular differentiation.","['Cloyd, M W']",['Cloyd MW'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,IM,"['Animals', '*Genes, Viral', 'Lymphoid Tissue/microbiology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/*microbiology', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'Thymus Gland/microbiology', 'Virus Replication']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(83)90512-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(83)90512-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1983 Jan;32(1):217-25. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(83)90512-3.,"['0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",,,,

Analysis of the genetic control of NK-activity in mice have provided several models to test the in vivo role of NK-cells in defence against neoplasia. Studies of certain F1-hybrid and backcross combinations have revealed a correlation between H-2 linked in vivo resistance and in vitro NK-activity against semisyngeneic transplantable tumors. The beige (bg) mutation in C57B1 mice causes a partial impairment of NK-activity, and can therefore serve to evaluate whether NK-cells can contribute to resistance against syngeneic tumors in the normal intact host. We have recently studied natural resistance against the ascitic lines of one chemically and two virally induced syngeneic leukemias in C57B1.bg/bg mice and their phenotypically normal heterozygous littermates. S.c. threshold inocula of all three leukemia lines grew faster and caused death earlier in bg/bg than in +/bg mice, and two of the lines were rejected completely at a significantly higher frequency in +/bg control animals. The +/bg mice also eliminated 125I-IdUrd-labelled leukemia cells at a faster rate than bg/bg mice, as measured by pulmonary, hepatic and splenic radioactivity retained 14-30 h after i.v. injection. The bg mutation was also possible to study in T-cell free mice, by combining it with the nu mutation on a C57B1 background. The NK-activity of such beige-nude mice was found to be partially impaired compared to nude (non-beige) or wild type animals, but higher than that of beige (non-nude) mice. Our results suggest that NK-cells may be responsible for elimination of small numbers of tumor cells in the intact syngeneic host. The further use of beige and beige-nude mice in studies of transplanted and primary, autochthonous tumors will be discussed.","['Karre, K', 'Klein, G O', 'Kiessling, R', 'Klein, G']","['Karre K', 'Klein GO', 'Kiessling R', 'Klein G']",['eng'],"['1R01 CA 14054-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01 CA 26782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Japan,Tokai J Exp Clin Med,The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine,7704186,IM,"['Animals', 'Genes', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/genetics', 'Mice, Inbred DBA/genetics', 'Mice, Mutant Strains/genetics', 'Mice, Nude/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Species Specificity']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tokai J Exp Clin Med. 1983 Dec;8(5-6):429-48.,['0 (H-2 Antigens)'],,,,

One of the roles of the thymus in leukemogenesis is to provide permissive microenvironments for the progression of developing leukemias from thymus-dependent to independent growth. We have devised a method to consistently isolate the symbiotic complex of leukemia cells and thymic epithelium-like stromal cells from primary leukemic thymuses. In such complexes, leukemia cells were able to proliferate in close association with thymic stromal cells in pseudoemperipolesis, i.e., a unique form of cell interaction which we defined. In normal thymus, subcapsular zone blasts, mitotically active early thymic lymphocytes, were able to form similar complexes with thymic stromal cells, but this property was lost as they differentiated into cortical small lymphocytes. These observations indicate that the stage of intrathymic progression of leukemias is critically linked with the stage of subcapsular zone blasts of normal thymic lymphopoiesis. Mechanism and regulation of the complex formation was analyzed by an in vitro assay. We found that many thymic microenvironment-dependent leukemia cells were reversibly stimulated to proliferate by various tumor-promoters sharing a cellular receptor for phorbol esters. Without support by adequate stromal cells or a tumor promoter, leukemia cells rapidly ceased to grow and died. The degree of growth stimulation was well correlated with their tumor-promoting activity in mouse skin. Action of tumor promoters on microenvironment-dependent leukemias seemed to be direct rather than mediated by lymphokines. Another remarkable effect of tumor promoters was their inhibition of complex formation, presumably by affecting the cytoskeleton.","['Hiai, H', 'Kaneshima, H', 'Nishi, Y', 'Nishizuka, Y']","['Hiai H', 'Kaneshima H', 'Nishi Y', 'Nishizuka Y']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Leukemia/*etiology/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/toxicity', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*physiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*etiology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1983;14:361-71.,['NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)'],,,,

Although its mode of action has not been fully elucidated, it appears that spirogermanium is not a phase or cell cycle specific drug and inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, the protein synthesis being the most susceptible to this agent. Spirogermanium has shown cytotoxic activity in vitro against several human tumor cell lines at concentrations (1 micrograms/ml) that were also found toxic to the cultured rat neurons. Although spirogermanium has no effect on normal bone marrow colony forming cells in mice, dogs, or man, it has revealed cytotoxic activity in vitro against human myeloid leukemia cell line K 562 at clinically achievable concentrations. These in vitro findings, indicating selective cytotoxic activity against leukemic cells suggest this drug as a candidate for clinical studies in acute and chronic leukemias. Spirogermanium has revealed activity in vivo against intraperitoneally implanted Walker 256 sarcoma, 13762 mammary adenocarcinoma, and 11095 prostatic carcinoma in rats, but no antitumor activity in vivo was found in the murine tumors used in the past by the NCI screen (L 1210 and P 388 leukemia, B 16 melanoma, Lewis lung carcinoma). Spirogermanium is remarkable for its lack of bone marrow toxicity confirmed in preclinical toxicology and clinical studies; moderate, predictable, and reversible CNS toxicity is dose-limiting. Activity in malignant lymphoma, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, large bowel cancer, and prostatic cancer was reported in the clinical studies. The drug is currently under clinical investigation against the wide spectrum of solid tumors and malignant lymphomas. The dose of 80-120 mg/m2, given by 60' infusion three times a week, is currently used and tolerated in Phase II clinical studies. The recently introduced five days continuous infusion schedule has been also under clinical investigation and the doses of 250-300 mg/m2/day are recommended for Phase II studies. Of interest are results reported in this paper of spirogermanium in vitro preferential activity against the resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum at clinically achievable concentrations suggesting this drug as a possible new antimalarial agent of novel structure.","['Slavik, M', 'Blanc, O', 'Davis, J']","['Slavik M', 'Blanc O', 'Davis J']",['eng'],['CA-21074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Dogs', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Germanium/*pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', '*Organometallic Compounds', 'Spiro Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00208894 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1983;1(3):225-34. doi: 10.1007/BF00208894.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '00072J7XWS (Germanium)', '1F01P3Y61E (spirogermanium)']",,,,

A BALB/c mouse skin toxicity model was used to evaluate the ulcerative potential of intradermal (ID) VP-16 and its lipophilic solvent system along with the main ingredient of the VM-26 solvent, polyethoxylated castor oil (PECO). ID VP-16 caused dose-dependent ulceration following 0.17 mg, 0.33 mg (50 mg/M2) or 1.0 mg (150 mg/M2). Both normal saline (0.05 ml ID) and hyaluronidase (7.5 u ID) were effective as local VP-16 antidotes, presumably by diluting out the extravasated drug. The VP-16 solvent alone was as toxic as the 1.0 mg (undiluted) ID VP-16 injection. ID PECO was mildly ulcerative in mouse skin. When given to P-388 lymphocytic leukemia-bearing mice, both VP-16 (24 mg/kg IP for 3 doses) and VM-26 (8 mg/kg IP for 2 doses) were active, producing increased life spans (ILS) of 160% and 90%, respectively. The solvents, given IP at the same schedule, did not increase or decrease the life span of tumor-bearing mice, but did increase morbidity. In an in vitro human tumor clonogenic assay (WiDr colon carcinoma and HEC-1A endometrial carcinoma in soft agar), both VP-16 and VM-26 showed moderate to complete inhibition of tumor colony forming units (TCFUs) by continuous exposure. 1-h drug exposures were marginally active at reducing TCFUs. None of the epipodophyllotoxin diluents at clinical concentrations reduced TCFUs. At very high concentrations, both epipodophyllotoxins were cytotoxic.

The amidino- and imidazolino-substituted aryl moieties of the compounds consisted of phenyl, indole, indene, benzofuran, benzo[b]thiophene or benzimidazole. Several of these compounds were found to inhibit L1210 cell proliferation with an ID50 (50% inhibitory dose) of 1 microgram/ml or lower. Structure-function analysis revealed that the antitumor cell activity of the diarylamidines depended on the planarity of the molecule, the presence of amidino- (or, preferably, imidazolino-) groups on both aryl moieties, the nature of the bridge connecting the two aryl moieties (preferably no bridge at all, phenoxy or ethene) and, finally, the nature of the aryl moieties (preferably, benzofuran or benzo[b]thiophene). Hence, compound 20 (6-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)-2-[4-(2-imidazolin-2-yl)phenyl] benzo[b]thiophene) emerged as the most potent inhibitor of L1210 cell growth (ID50: 0.21 micrograms/ml). Its inhibitory potency was similar to that of the well-known trypanocidal drug ethidium bromide (compound 98). For all diarylamidine derivatives taken together, some correlation (r = 0.612) was noted between the log ID50 for L1210 cell proliferation and the log ID50 for L1210 cell DNA synthesis (as monitored by [methyl-3H]dThd incorporation). These findings suggest that the inhibitory effects of the diarylamidines on L1210 cell proliferation may at least partially reside in an inhibition of DNA synthesis. Compound 41 (2,2'-vinylenedi-1-benzofuran-5-carboxamidine), that exhibited a potent antitumor activity in vitro (ID50: 1.5 micrograms/ml), was further evaluated for its antitumor efficacy in vivo and found to increase the median survival time of L1210 cell-inoculated BDF1 mice up to 204%, if administered at a dose of 200 mg/kg.","['Balzarini, J', 'de Clercq, E', 'Dann, O']","['Balzarini J', 'de Clercq E', 'Dann O']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,IM,"['Amidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00172069 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1983;1(2):103-15. doi: 10.1007/BF00172069.,"['0 (Amidines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Imidazoles)']",,,,

By 9 to 10 days after transfection, however, pMOV-psi- -transfected cells produce infectious virus. Thus pMOV-psi- has a defect that can be repaired in transfected NIH/3T3 cells, presumably by recombination with a sequence normally present in the cells. Cell lines with pMOV-psi- stably integrated into chromosomal DNA produce reverse-transcriptase-containing particles that lack detectable M-MuLV RNA but the cells efficiently complement replication-defective, packagable retroviruses. Thus pMOV-psi- has a defect in the packaging of genomic RNA into virions but can provide in trans the products necessary for virion production.

A neurogenic tumor was not seriously considered clinically in either case, because of the paucity of previous reports on the occurrence of neural tumors in the lacrimal fossa region. Instead, in the first case a benign mixed tumor was considered the most likely clinical diagnosis, whereas in the second the coexistence of a swelling in the parotid gland raised the possibilities of a lymphoid tumor or a leukemia. Due to unusual light microscopic features, transmission electron microscopy was required to secure unequivocal diagnoses. In the orbital lobe tumor, an encapsulated spindle cell proliferation without nuclear palisading but with focal areas of myxoid change suggested either a cellular benign mixed tumor or a schwannoma. The palpebral lobe lesion displayed a myxoid spindle cell proliferation that had splayed apart the ducts and acinae of the lacrimal gland, to impart the overall appearance of a benign mixed tumor. The ducts, however, were multilaminar rather than possessing the usual double cellular layer seen in classical benign mixed tumors, and the glandular units contained zymogen granules, which are typically not seen in benign mixed tumors. Electron microscopy disclosed in both lesions the presence of interrupted basement membrane material partially surrounding the tumor cells, long spacing collagen (banded basement membrane material), and poorly developed desmosomes, features compatible with a neural tumor.

Common abnormalities were deletion of the long arm of No. 6 or +3 each in 3 patients, and +Y, +12 or +18 in 2 patients. Actuarial survival for each group was calculated from diagnosis and also from chromosome examination. The two patients with a clonal chromosome abnormality died within one year. Eight of 13 patients with nonclonal structural abnormalities died within 5 years after diagnosis, while none of 5 patients with nonclonal numerical abnormalities and 2 of 19 patients with normal chromosomes died within 5 years. The difference in the 5-year actuarial survival between patients with nonclonal abnormalities (groups II and III) and those with a normal karyotype was significant (p less than 0.05). The difference was more marked between patients with nonclonal structural abnormalities and those with a normal karyotype (p less than 0.01).

The protein kinase is manifested by the phosphorylation of endogenous protein of molecular weight 67 kD (p67K kinase). Control and L-1210R or L-1210S tumor-bearing mice were found to respond similarly to treatment with IFN or when injected with an IFN inducer, poly(I) X poly(C). The 2-5A synthetase and the p67K kinase were enhanced in the lung and the spleen of mice, both control and with tumor graft. There was no apparent effect on L-1210R leukemia cells whereas in L-1210S cells the level of both enzymes was enhanced in response to treatment of mice with IFN or poly(I) X poly(C). These results indicate that the presence of tumor cells did not trigger modifications in the response of mice toward treatment with IFN.

The host-related part of the colonization resistance has been found to be somewhat decreased by sublethal irradiation and leukemia (or chemotherapy), while treatment with antibiotics active against gram-positive flora may severely decrease the colonization resistance (depending on the antibiotic concentration established within the digestive tract during antibiotic therapy). The flora-related part of the colonization resistance, which controls colonization by potentially pathogenic microorganisms, differs greatly from one individual to the next. This observation appears to be important for the host-related part of the colonization resistance. Finally, it is concluded that in the clinical situation preference should be given to antibiotics which do not affect the part of the flora constituting colonization resistance for two reasons: 1) to limit the spread of (multi-) resistant potentially pathogenic microorganisms and 2) for infection prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients. In the latter situation, the potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the flora are selectively eliminated from the digestive tract, provided the antimicrobial drugs used for selective decontamination are active against the endogenous potentially pathogenic microorganisms and given in sufficient (oral) doses.","['van der Waaij, D']",['van der Waaij D'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Digestive System/*microbiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enterobacteriaceae/growth & development/*pathogenicity', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01645295 [doi]'],ppublish,Infection. 1983;11 Suppl 2:S90-2. doi: 10.1007/BF01645295.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",,,,

It was found that the amount of low molecular weight oligo(A) fragments gradually decreases during ageing of the animals; the amount in the mature animal group was significantly higher (6-fold) than in the old animal group. The decreased amounts of oligo(A) during S phase and ageing could in part be due to posttranslational modification of enzymes involved in poly(A) metabolism.

At NCRPBL, half of the chicks were brooded and reared on floor and half in cages, and all hens were laying tested at one or two birds per cage. Most hens housed one per cage were tested for lymphoid leukosis virus (LLV) infection by the complement fixation test for group specific antigen in egg albumen. When all hens tested at NCRPBL were considered, the method of brooding and rearing affected only egg weight and body weight in favor of the hens reared in floor pens. The commercial stock and the strain crosses performed better than the control strains. Despite very similar genetic backgrounds, there were large differences between control strains 10 and NCR. Hens housed one per cage had lower mortality and higher egg production than those housed two per cage. Average performance of birds at ARC was somewhat better than that at NCRPBL, but there were genotype-site interactions for mortality, egg production, and sexual maturity. The frequency of shedders in the crosses (17.2%) was the same as that of the control strains (20.8%), but the frequency of shedders in the commercial stock (4.5%) was much lower. The method of brooding and rearing had no effect on the frequency of shedders. The LLV infection was associated with significant reductions in egg production and egg quality.

Apparent steady state plasma levels of ara-C during 13 infusions averaged 115 +/- 32 microM. Upon cessation of the infusion, cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) was rapidly cleared from the plasma. The apparent postinfusion kinetics of ara-C were triexponential with a distribution half-life of 16 minutes and elimination half-lives of 1.8 hours and six hours. Total clearance averaged 86 L per hour and mean residence time averaged 0.47 hours. Disease status (relapse or remission) had no apparent effect on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ara-C. Peak levels of ara-U averaged 310 microM and the metabolite had an average apparent elimination half-life of 3.75 hours. Despite the persistence of ara-U at about 100 microM at the time of administration of subsequent infusions of ara-C, there was no further accumulation of ara-U in the plasma with repetitive infusions of HiDAC. In vitro studies indicate that ara-U can exert an inhibitory effect on deoxycytidine (dCyd) deaminase activity. The ratio of the Ki of ara-U to the Km of ara-C for cytidine (Cyd)-dCyd deaminase is 40:1; however, during the gamma phase of ara-C elimination, the ratio of ara-U:ara-C in plasma is at least 100:1. Thus, a retardation of systemic catabolism of ara-C by ara-U is possible. Two to three hours after the termination of the HiDAC infusion, the ara-C cerebrospinal fluid: plasma ratio is 1-3:1, a feature of potential therapeutic significance. The slower elimination of ara-C from the CSF may also contribute to the plasma gamma half-life.","['Capizzi, R L', 'Yang, J L', 'Cheng, E', 'Bjornsson, T', 'Sahasrabudhe, D', 'Tan, R S', 'Cheng, Y C']","['Capizzi RL', 'Yang JL', 'Cheng E', 'Bjornsson T', 'Sahasrabudhe D', 'Tan RS', 'Cheng YC']",['eng'],"['CA17973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA27488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31715/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Arabinofuranosyluracil/*blood', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*blood/cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/blood', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Time Factors', 'Uridine/*analogs & derivatives']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1983.1.12.763 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1983 Dec;1(12):763-71. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1983.1.12.763.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3083-77-0 (Arabinofuranosyluracil)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (deoxycytidine deaminase)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",,,,

On the other hand, 63 among 4,797 cases with clinically unsuspected DIC revealed microthrombus formation in three or more organs by the postmortem examination.","['Tanaka, K', 'Imamura, T']","['Tanaka K', 'Imamura T']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Bibl Haematol,Bibliotheca haematologica,0372513,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Bacterial Infections/complications', 'Blood Coagulation', 'Blood Vessels/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/complications/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/complications', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Organ Specificity']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000408449 [doi]'],ppublish,Bibl Haematol. 1983;(49):79-93. doi: 10.1159/000408449.,,,,,

The following results were obtained. Homogenates of APL leukocytes and gastric cancer tissues contained strong procoagulant activities, most of which have been identified as TTP since the activities were neutralized by a specific antibody against purified human placenta TTP, inactivated by the removal of phospholipid with heptane-butanol mixture, and inactivated by the addition of phospholipase C. The delipidated homogenates regained procoagulant activities by relipidation procedures. These results also confirmed that TTP from APL leukocytes and gastric cancer tissues have the same lipoprotein properties as those of TTP in normal tissues. Though slight proteolytic activity and fibrinolytic activity were demonstrated in the homogenate of gastric cancer tissues, it was noted that the TTP activity was different from these two activities by partial purification of TTP from gastric cancer tissues. The TTP activity of 9 homogenates of gastric cancer tissues was 301 +/- 289 (mean +/- SD) units per mg protein, being higher in homogenates of mucinous adenocarcinoma and signet-ring cell carcinoma than in those of tubular and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The mean TTP activity of leukocyte homogenates from 14 patients with APL and one out of 4 patients with CML in blastic crisis was 81 +/- 76 units/10(7) cells. The TTP activity of the homogenates of leukocytes from 7 out of 18 patients with AML and another patient with CML in blastic crisis ranged from one to six units/10(7) cells with a mean of 3.3 +/- 1.2. The TTP activity of leukocyte homogenates from the other 11 cases of AML, two cases of CML in blastic crisis, 6 cases of CML, and one case each of ALL and CLL were less than one unit/10(7) cells. In leukemic patients, all cases with a value of more than 202 for the product of units of TTP activity per 10(7) cells and differential count (%) of leukemic cells in the bone marrow smear (MU value) were accompanied by DIC. The MU value of leukemic patients correlated well to the plasma fibrinogen and serum FDP levels. All patients with a MU value of more than 277 died of DIC when a sufficient amount of heparin was not administered. On the other hand, no DIC developed in any of the patients with a MU value of less than 90.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Gonmori, H', 'Maekawa, T', 'Kobayashi, N', 'Tanaka, H', 'Tsukada, H', 'Takada, M', 'Andou, K']","['Gonmori H', 'Maekawa T', 'Kobayashi N', 'Tanaka H', 'Tsukada H', 'Takada M', 'Andou K']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Bibl Haematol,Bibliotheca haematologica,0372513,IM,"['Blood Coagulation', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*etiology', 'Gastric Mucosa/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*complications/metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/blood/metabolism/*physiology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000408444 [doi]'],ppublish,Bibl Haematol. 1983;(49):23-39. doi: 10.1159/000408444.,['9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)'],,,,

It is the study of biological rhythms. This paper introduces chronobiology and some of its vocabulary, principles, and techniques. A circadian rhythm is a regularly repetitive, quantitative physiological change with a period of about 24 hr (20-28), but the spectrum of rhythms includes those with periods less than 20 hr (ultradian) and longer than 28 hr (infradian). These rhythms are ubiquitous among the eukaryotes, innate and endogenous; their periods are precisely controlled by synchronizers in the environment. Rhythms can be manipulated by altering their synchronizers or by introducing more dominant ones. When organisms are removed from their environment and placed in constant conditions, rhythms revert to their natural frequencies and free-run. All of an organism's rhythms operate simultaneously, but their peaks and troughs do not necessarily occur at the same time. There are rhythms in susceptibility to drugs; a fixed dose may have a therapeutic effect at one point along the 24 hr time scale and a harmful one at another. Knowledge of these rhythms can be important when designing experimental or treatment protocols and interpreting results. Examples are provided to show that single-time-point sampling can lead to erroneous results, unless biological periodicity is taken into consideration.","['Pauly, J E']",['Pauly JE'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Anat,The American journal of anatomy,0376312,IM,"['Animals', '*Biological Clocks', 'Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Periodicity', 'Rats', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Time Factors']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/aja.1001680403 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Anat. 1983 Dec;168(4):365-88. doi: 10.1002/aja.1001680403.,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],,,,

Forty-five per cent of cases showed increased malonyldialdehyde (MDA) levels indicating in vivo peroxidation of membrane lipids in leukemia patients. Red cell superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was reduced in 25% of cases while plasma alpha-tocopherol levels were markedly low in 68% of patients. The presence of an inverse correlation between MDA levels and SOD and tocopherol levels in a large number of cases suggested that the red cells in leukemia lack the ability to counter increased oxidative stress. Low hemoglobin content of the red cells in these patients seemed to contribute to the oxidative injury to the membrane by rendering the latter more accessible to the oxidants. While methemoglobinemia may enhance tissue hypoxia, membrane lipid peroxidation could explain the shortened erythrocyte life-span and anemia in leukemia.","['Pavri, R S', 'Gupta, A D', 'Baxi, A J', 'Advani, S H']","['Pavri RS', 'Gupta AD', 'Baxi AJ', 'Advani SH']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Erythrocyte Membrane/*metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/enzymology', 'Hemoglobins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxides/blood', 'Malondialdehyde/blood', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Superoxide Dismutase/analysis', 'Vitamin E/blood']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(83)90066-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1983;7(6):729-33. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(83)90066-8.,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",,,,

Analysis of the 1012 chromosomes in 22 zygotene and pachytene spermatocyte nuclei showed that in most of the cells that reached the pachytene stage, one or more of the following abnormalities were found in the intranuclear structures: decreased condensation of euchromatin, centromeric heterochromatin, diffuse heterochromatin, or abnormal nucleolar morphology. The total number of recombination nodules and -bars was within normal limits, but in some nuclei the ratio between the two types of structure was inappropriate for the stage, indicating developmental asynchrony. With the exception of one nucleus, there was no increase in abnormalities of pairing and synaptonemal complex formation. The number of structural aberrations in autosomal and sex chromosomes was similar to that found in the reference material. The repair system responsible for resolving chromosome interlockings in zygotene was functioning. It is not possible to predict which of the short term effects found will become permanent and thus pose a risk of genetically abnormal conceptions. New means of classifying meiotic chromosomes, of evaluating the synchrony of development, and of analysing the telomere attachment pattern are described.","['Berthelsen, J G', 'Skakkebaek, N E']","['Berthelsen JG', 'Skakkebaek NE']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Centromere/ultrastructure', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Meiosis/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Spermatozoa/*ultrastructure', 'Testis/ultrastructure']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(83)90065-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1983;7(6):713-27. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(83)90065-6.,,,,,

The level of acetylcholinesterase activity increased two to five-fold in induced cells, and induction by retinoids, like induction by dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), promoted the appearance of cell surface lumps or 'blebs'.

One or more studies found male or female associations between asbestos in water supplies and cancer mortality (or incidence) due to neoplasms of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum, gallbladder, pancreas, peritoneum, lungs, pleura, prostate, kidneys, brain, and thyroid, and also due to leukemia. Several methodologic weaknesses and limitations were found in each study, leading to the determination that no individual study or aggregation of studies exist that would establish risk levels from ingested asbestos. A binomial probability analysis of the eight independent studies suggested that, while the level of male-female agreement was generally low, the number of observed positive associations in males and females for neoplasms of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and prostate was unlikely to have been generated by chance factors alone, and thus, may have a biological basis related to ingested asbestos. Cancers of the small intestine and leukemia were implicated to a lesser degree in this analysis. The patterns of integrated findings for most gastrointestinal cancers were somewhat consistent with patterns observed among asbestos-exposed occupational groups, whereas the patterns found for pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, and leukemia were not consistent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Marsh, G M']",['Marsh GM'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Asbestos/*adverse effects', 'Canada', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'United States', 'Water Supply/standards']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.835349 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1983 Nov;53:49-56. doi: 10.1289/ehp.835349.,['1332-21-4 (Asbestos)'],PMC1569098,,,

Virus adsorption was assayed by determining reverse transcriptase activity in the inoculating virus stock and in the cell membrane fraction before and after 45 minutes of infection. Both measurements suggested that IFN had no effect on virus adsorption. Virus penetration was determined by measuring the amount of viral RNA in the cell cytoplasm at 45 minutes after infection. This amount was remarkably lower in IFN-treated than in untreated cells. This reduction was not due to inhibition of a possible induction of endogenous viral genetic information by the penetrating virions, but was proved to be a direct effect of IFN on virus penetration, which was related to the IFN-induced antiviral state. The effect of IFN on binding of parental genome RNA to polyribosomes was then investigated by analysing Crt hybridization kinetics of polyribosomal viral RNA at different time intervals after infection. While in untreated control cells maximal binding occurred at 3 hours postinfection, this maximal binding was observed in IFN-treated cells at 5 hours postinfection. The distribution of viral RNA molecules between sub-cytoplasmic fractions at 3 hours after infection was, in IFN-treated cells, significantly different from that observed in the untreated cells.","['Salzberg, S', 'Shurtz, R', 'Feder, J', 'Aboud, M']","['Salzberg S', 'Shurtz R', 'Feder J', 'Aboud M']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,IM,"['Adsorption', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*microbiology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Genes, Viral', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polyribosomes/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01311321 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 1983;78(3-4):267-78. doi: 10.1007/BF01311321.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,

The peroxidase-antiperoxidase method of antibody-antigen detection was employed to visualize individual antigens resolved on one-dimensional polyacrylamide gels following transfer to sheets of nitrocellulose (immunotransfers). Each antiserum contained multiple antigen specificities as evidenced by the diverse patterns of reactive bands displayed on the immunotransfers. The most striking difference in antigens recognized between the antisera was observed in the molecular weight region below 50,000, where two highly reactive bands were seen mainly with antiserum to nuclear materials released by deoxyribonuclease I digestion. The antigens detected with all of the antisera were present in chromatins prepared from proliferating cells, while the levels of antigens present in chromatin from non-proliferating peripheral blood lymphocytes were greatly reduced or not detected. Antigens in chromatin from proliferating cells that migrated with apparent molecular weights of 37,000 and 100,000 were not lost once the activities to antigens in lymphocyte chromatin were absorbed out. These two activities were absorbed from antisera with the same amount of chromatins from proliferating cells.

On theoretical and experimental grounds, the linear no-threshold dose-response relationship is a reasonable basis for extrapolating effects to low doses. Leukemia is frequently the earliest observed radiogenic cancer but is now considered to be of minor importance, because the radiation effect dies out after 25 or 30 years, whereas solid tumors induced by radiation develop later and the increased cancer risk evidently persists for the remaining lifetime. Current estimates of the risk of particular cancers from radiation exposure cannot be fully evaluated until the population under study have been followed at least 40 or 50 years after exposure. Recent evidence indicates that for lung cancer induction, combination of cigarette smoking and radiation exposure leads to risks that are not multiplicative but rather nearly additive.","['Radford, E P']",['Radford EP'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.835245 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1983 Oct;52:45-50. doi: 10.1289/ehp.835245.,,PMC1569344,,,

Problems of accuracy of diagnosis or causes of death on death certificates, estimates of population, migration from areas of study, and the issue of ""ecological fallacy"" are discussed. Retrospective studies have such problems as recall of previous environmental exposure, selection bias and survivor bias. In environmental epidemiology, prospective studies have been used. The problems associated with these studies are illustrated by reviewing some of the details of the study of effects of microwave radiation on embassy employees in Moscow. The study population had to be reconstructed, individuals had to be located and information on exposure status had to be obtained by questionnaire.

Human lactoferrin has higher growth stimulatory activity than human transferrin, and was sensitive to heat. Long-term cultivation of the cells was achieved in the defined medium supplemented with human lactoferrin only. The defined medium specifically supported the growth of various other human B- and T-lymphocytic cell lines but not the growth of various mouse lymphocytic cell lines. In lactoferrin-supplemented medium, the growth of some human cell lines were further stimulated by the addition of a combination of insulin, ethanolamine and selenium, or another combination of 2-mercaptoethanol and the above three factors.

Four patients developed cerebellar degeneration during treatment. Ataxia of gait and limb movements, dysarthria, and nystagmus appeared five to seven days after the first dose, worsened over the next two to three days, and then remained stable for two to six days. Incomplete improvement occurred over the following one to two weeks. Postmortem examination disclosed loss of Purkinje cells in the depths of cortical sulci with relative preservation of those at the crests of folia and those in the most posterior inferior portions of the cerebellum. Other patients developed a mild, reversible cerebellar syndrome over the same time course as that of the irreversible disorder. Manifestations ranged from nystagmus alone to dysarthria and unsteadiness of gait without limb ataxia.

Dyspoietic abnormalities developed while two patients were receiving maintenance chemotherapy; the other two patients received no maintenance therapy. The dyspoietic changes in these four patients greatly exceeded those noted in a control group of ANLL patients on maintenance chemotherapy. The morphologic features of postleukemic dysmyelopoiesis were similar to those described in preleukemic dysmyelopoietic disorders. Erythroid abnormalities included hyperplasia with ring sideroblasts, megaloblastic changes, and cytoplasmic PAS reactivity. Myeloid abnormalities consisted of left-shifted granulopoiesis with hyper- and hyposegmentation; megakaryocytic abnormalities included hyperplasia with a predominance of hypolobulated forms. Three of the four patients eventually suffered relapse and have died. The fourth patient died of sepsis after 20 months of pancytopenia and dysmyelopoiesis. Theories to explain the development of postleukemic dysmyelopoiesis are presented which emphasize the possibility of drug-induced leukemia cell differentiation. Cytogenetic studies will be necessary to establish any relationship between ANLL and the subsequent postleukemic dysmyelopoiesis.","['Foucar, K', 'Vaughan, W P', 'Armitage, J O', 'Patil, S', 'Dick, F', 'Karp, J E']","['Foucar K', 'Vaughan WP', 'Armitage JO', 'Patil S', 'Dick F', 'Karp JE']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/*ultrastructure', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/genetics/pathology']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830150403 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1983 Dec;15(4):321-34. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830150403.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,

Inoculation of B16 melanoma or L1210 leukemic cells into these immunosuppressed mice caused a high incidence of pulmonary metastasis or rapid death, respectively. Thymosin alpha 1 given concomitantly with cytostatics or after X-ray prevented such deleterious effects of these agents. One of possible mechanisms causing the rapid death and increasing the metastasis is the damage to NK cells. Thymosin alpha 1 prevented the reduction of NK cell activity caused by these agents. The preventive activity could be transferred to immunosuppressed recipients by spleen cells and those deprived of T cells, but not by those deprived of NK cells. Another possible mechanism is the aberration of the barrier system for spread of tumor cells in blood circulation, which may allow the tumor cells to migrate to various sites in the host. In 5-FU-treated mice, distribution of 125I-L1210 cells upon inoculation was higher in blood and lung, but lower in liver and spleen as compared with that in normal mice. On the other hand, when thymosin alpha 1 was given with 5-FU, the pattern of the tissue distribution was almost the same as that in normal mice. Thus, thymosin alpha 1 protected mice which received immunosuppressive agents from undesirable effects of the agents on surveillance systems against tumor. Thymosin alpha 1 may be useful as an adjuvant in cancer therapies.","['Ishitsuka, H', 'Umeda, Y', 'Sakamoto, A', 'Yagi, Y']","['Ishitsuka H', 'Umeda Y', 'Sakamoto A', 'Yagi Y']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Thymalfasin', 'Thymosin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4757-1410-4_9 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1983;166:89-100. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4757-1410-4_9.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '61512-21-8 (Thymosin)', 'W0B22ISQ1C (Thymalfasin)']",,,,

In BL, the distal portion of chromosome 8 breaks off and is transposed, in most cases, to chromosome 14, known to carry the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus. In about 5% of the cases the same distal part of the chromosome 8 has moved to either chromosome 2 or 22, to the neighbourhood of the kappa or the lambda locus, respectively. In MPC the distal region of chromosome 15 is transposed to the chromosome 12, known to carry the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus, or enters into reciprocal exchange with the kappa locus-carrying chromosome 6 (ref. 7). Several laboratories have located c-myc, the cellular homologue of the MC29 retroviral oncogene v-myc, to human chromosome 8 (refs 8-10) and mouse chromosome 15 (refs 11-13). It has also been shown that the BL- and MPC-associated translocations remove the c-myc gene from its original site and transpose it into or close to one of the immunoglobulin gene clusters. In view of the above findings we also looked for possible involvement of the c-myc gene in a B-cell-derived tumour of a third species, the rat. Rat immunocytomas of spontaneous origin carry a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 6 and 7 (ref. 17). Here we have localized the c-myc locus to chromosome 7 of the rat. Moreover, we have found that the c-myc gene was rearranged in four of five immunocytomas carrying the characteristic chromosomal translocation.","['Sumegi, J', 'Spira, J', 'Bazin, H', 'Szpirer, J', 'Levan, G', 'Klein, G']","['Sumegi J', 'Spira J', 'Bazin H', 'Szpirer J', 'Levan G', 'Klein G']",['eng'],['2 R01 CA14054-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Rats', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/306497a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1983 Dec 1-7;306(5942):497-8. doi: 10.1038/306497a0.,,,,,

In particular, the c-myc gene is translocated in Burkitt's lymphoma and is amplified in the human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, HL-60, which contains double minute chromosomes (DMs). More recently, an amplified c-myc gene has been positioned on a chromosomal homogeneous staining region (HSR) in a human colon cancer cell line, COLO 320, with neuroendocrine properties. Furthermore, c-myc is expressed in increased amounts in some human tumour lines, and in some cases, human small cell lung cancers (SCLC) contain DMs and HSRs. These findings prompted us to study the c-myc gene and its RNA expression in a series of human lung cancer cell lines. We now report amplification and expression of the c-myc oncogene in a system other than B-cell lymphomas, namely human lung cancer. Of 18 human lung cancer cell lines tested, 8 showed an amplified 12.5-kilobase (kb) EcoRI c-myc DNA band. Of particular interest are five SCLC lines with a high degree of c-myc DNA amplification (20-76-fold) and greatly increased levels of c-myc RNA. All five lines reside in the variant class of SCLC (SCLC-V) characterized by altered morphology, lack of expression of some SCLC-differentiated functions and more malignant behaviour than pure SCLC. Three of the five lines which have been karyotyped also contain DMs or HSRs. The finding of a greatly amplified c-myc gene in all cell lines of the SCLC-V class examined strongly suggests a role for the c-myc gene in the phenotypic conversion and malignant behaviour of human lung cancer.","['Little, C D', 'Nau, M M', 'Carney, D N', 'Gazdar, A F', 'Minna, J D']","['Little CD', 'Nau MM', 'Carney DN', 'Gazdar AF', 'Minna JD']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",1983/11/10 00:00,1983/11/10 00:01,['1983/11/10 00:00'],"['1983/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/306194a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1983 Nov 10-16;306(5939):194-6. doi: 10.1038/306194a0.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,

Of 30 clones tested, 2 appeared to be relatively resistant to IFN, since the replication of both vesicular stomatitis virus and mengovirus was not inhibited, even in the presence of 1,000 U of IFN per ml. One resistant (A10) and one sensitive (A5) clone were further analyzed. In both clones, murine leukemia virus replication was equally inhibited by IFN, indicating the presence of functional receptors for IFN in the resistant clone. Using the (2'-5')oligoadenylate (2-5A) radiobinding assay, we could demonstrate that both clones contained the RNase L protein. Furthermore, this enzyme appears to be active, since a similar reduction in the rate of protein synthesis was evident after the introduction of exogenous 2-5A to the cells. We also analyzed the activity of another enzyme in the 2-5A pathway, namely, 2-5A synthetase. In the sensitive cells (A5), the induction of enzyme activity was proportional to the IFN concentration used, reaching a maximum of more than a 10-fold increase over the background of untreated cells. However, little if any induction over the basal activity was observed in the resistant cells (A10) when similar doses of IFN were used. It is thus probable that the lack of induction of 2-5A synthetase activity by IFN in A10 cells is at least partly responsible for their relative resistance to IFN treatment.","['Salzberg, S', 'Wreschner, D H', 'Oberman, F', 'Panet, A', 'Bakhanashvili, M']","['Salzberg S', 'Wreschner DH', 'Oberman F', 'Panet A', 'Bakhanashvili M']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/*biosynthesis/genetics"", 'Animals', '*Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance', 'Endoribonucleases/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/enzymology', 'Interferon Type I/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.3.10.1759-1765.1983 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1983 Oct;3(10):1759-65. doi: 10.1128/mcb.3.10.1759-1765.1983.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)"", 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.- (2-5A-dependent ribonuclease)']",PMC370037,,,

Cell populations were then mixed to establish continuous hematopoiesis in allogeneic or syngeneic combinations. Virus host range restriction between compartments was maintained in allogeneic reconstituted cultures which showed active hematopoiesis for 16-17 weeks and no significant differences between: (1) virus infected and uninfected groups or (2) groups comprised of stromal cells from one or the other strain.

The leukemogenic process requires a sequence of events from the productive infection of susceptible target cells and induction of preleukemic cells to irreversible neoplastic transformation. Preleukemic cells were detected in the thymus during the first week following virus injection. The thymus dependency of these cells was shown to depend transiently upon peculiar lymphoepithelial complexes called ""Thymic Nurse Cells"" (TNCs). Indeed, the first preleukemic cells appearing in the RadLV-inoculated thymuses were observed selectively within TNCs. They remained closely associated with these complexes during the first 2 or 4 weeks. Later on, TNCs disappeared almost completely whereas non-TNCs associated preleukemic cells were found. Lymphoepithelial interactions within TNCs were thus required for the initial events of RadLV-induced lymphomagenesis.

The clinicopathological features and the phenotype of the leukemic cells were compared with those of HCL in Western countries. The clinical pictures were similar to those in Western countries but some hematological findings were different. The Japanese patients had more marked leukocytosis, less granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, and no dry tap on bone marrow aspiration. The phenotype of hairy cells was much the same in both areas. Two kinds of anti-hairy cell sera were raised in rabbits. One (AHS 406) was obtained from rabbits immunized by injecting whole hairy cells. The other (alpha HC-G and alpha HC-M) was obtained by injection of membrane glycoproteins partially purified from hairy cells. The reactivity of the former antiserum (AHS 406) against leukemic cells from a variety of leukemias including HCL and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia was studied by an immunoprecipitation technique. AHS 406 defined three cell surface antigens on HCL, P-30, P-35 and GP-135 (30,000, 35,000 and 135,000 daltons respectively). These three components are expressed only on neoplastic B lymphocytes. Quantitative differences in expression were observed in different types of leukemia, although all three antigens were most strongly expressed in HCL. alpha HC-G showed reactivity similar to that of OKIa-1. alpha HC-M reacted with hairy cells but not with other leukemic cells except mature granulocytes of chronic myelocytic leukemia. It also reacted with most granulocytes and a few mononuclear cells in normal peripheral blood. Preliminary immunochemical studies suggest that alpha HC-M reacts with a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 26,000.","['Kitani, T', 'Machii, T', 'Inoue, R', 'Kanakura, Y']","['Kitani T', 'Machii T', 'Inoue R', 'Kanakura Y']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1983 Sep;13(3):497-509.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",,,,

The other 8 cell lines were moderately sensitive to both interferons. As the intervals of exchange of ReIFN-beta or IFN-beta were extended, the growth-inhibitory activity of both interferons decreased. This phenomenon, which was more significant with ReIFN-beta than IFN-beta, was explicable in terms of the stability of both interferons incubated in the culture medium at 37 degrees. The species specificity of IFN-beta was not mediated by carbohydrate since the growth-inhibitory activity of ReIFN-beta against 2 mouse cell lines was almost equivalent to that of IFN-beta.

This study was undertaken to clarify the mechanism of suppression of fibroblast colony formation in leukemic patients. Titration of the number of bone marrow cells did not indicate a linear relationship between the number of bone marrow cells cultured and the number of fibroblast colony formations. The number of fibroblast colony formations recovered by removal of nonadherent leukemic cells following one day of incubation increased. The cloning efficiency of patient bone marrow still showed increases in colony formation at higher plating concentrations after the nonadherent cells were removed. When leukemic and normal bone marrow cells were cocultured, the suppressive effect of leukemic cells on normal marrow fibroblast colony formation was clearly observed. The suppressive effect disappeared at complete remission, and then reappeared at relapse. Heat-inactivated serum and bone marrow culture media from leukemic patients whose fibroblast colony formations were small in number suppressed fibroblast colony formation from normal bone marrow. From these results, it was concluded that the suppression of fibroblast colony formation in leukemic patients was through humoral factors produced by leukemic cells.","['Nagao, T', 'Yamauchi, K', 'Komatsuda, M', 'Noguchi, K', 'Shimizu, M', 'Yonekura, S', 'Nozaki, H']","['Nagao T', 'Yamauchi K', 'Komatsuda M', 'Noguchi K', 'Shimizu M', 'Yonekura S', 'Nozaki H']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Clone Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media', 'Fetal Blood/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Glycopeptides/*physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*pathology']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63314-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1983 Dec;62(6):1261-5.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (fibroblast proliferation inhibitor)']",,,,

The cloning assay was done in all centers using an identical double-layer agar method with a common source of colony-stimulating factor. Cells were incubated for seven days, and clones were identified visually with an inverted microscope. All centers were able to obtain clonal growth in a substantial proportion of patients. Differences in growth pattern were observed between the major contributing center and the pooled results for all other centers. However, an analysis of clinical results suggested that in vitro differences were more likely related to differences in the patient populations than to variability in laboratory technique. The proportion of marrows in which leukemic cells formed colonies (greater than 40 cells) and large clusters (20-40 cells) was greater in relapsed patients than in newly presenting patients (P less than .06). A progressive improvement in induction treatment outcome was seen with decreasing clonal growth. Patients whose marrows did not produce clones had a complete remission (CR) rate of 83% versus 50% for those patients whose marrow leukemic cells formed colonies and/or large clusters (P = .05). In vitro drug sensitivity studies with cytosine arabinoside and adriamycin were performed on bone marrow cells of patients treated with this combination clinically. The percent killing of clonogenic cells in this assay correlated with remission induction outcome. Complete remission was obtained in 73% of 15 patients whose bone marrow leukemic cells showed greater than 30% killing by in vitro drug exposure, and CR was obtained in only 30% of 23 patients whose marrows showed less than 30% killing (P less than .01).

One reason for this discrepancy might be the fact that VIE-G4 detects only complete glycosylated GpA. If this is the sole explanation, this would mean that the poorly differentiated cells in these cases express incompletely glycosylated GpA.","['Liszka, K', 'Majdic, O', 'Bettelheim, P', 'Knapp, W']","['Liszka K', 'Majdic O', 'Bettelheim P', 'Knapp W']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Pernicious/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cell Line', 'Glycophorins/*immunology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*immunology']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830150303 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1983 Nov;15(3):219-26. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830150303.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)']",,,,

The tissues most commonly neoplastic were the skin, followed by the lymphoid tissue, the digestive tract and the genital system, which together accounted for 76,6% of the total tumours. Squamous cell carcinomas, the commonest type of tumour, accounted for 65 (26,7%) of the 243 neoplasms, followed by lymphosarcomas with 50 (20,5%). The majority of squamous cell carcinomas involved the skin, especially that of the ear and nose. A reasonably high proportion of these tumours also occurred on the tongue and eyelid. The commonest form of distribution for lymphosarcomas was the multicentric form, followed by the alimentary, the renal and thymic forms. Squamous cell carcinomas were the most frequent type of skin tumours, followed by basal cell tumours, mastocytomas and melanomas.

Pre- and postimmunization antibody titers were determined by radioimmunoassay. Treated patients with lymphoma had poor antibody response whether on or off chemotherapy.

Patients with solid tumors had antibody responses which were similar to those of the control population. Those patients who received sequential chemotherapy and immunization had a tendency for higher postimmunization titers than those patients who received simultaneous chemotherapy and immunization, but the difference was not significant. This study suggests that patients with solid tumors would be expected to benefit from pneumococcal immunization, whereas patients with lymphoma immunized after receiving treatment initially would not be expected to develop protective antibody levels.

A clinicopathologic review with emphasis on the prognostic variables predicting survival.,353-71,"We describe here a series of 88 consecutive patients with bone marrow fibrosis. Primary causes for the fibrosis were discovered in 26% of the cases shortly after the initial diagnosis. Pathology review of the remaining cases revealed an 8% incidence of ""hairy cell leukemia"" that had escaped detection originally. The remaining cases, characterized as having ""unexplained bone marrow fibrosis"" or ""idiopathic myelofibrosis,"" are the subject of this study. The clinical and laboratory findings are compared to those reported in previous series of selected cases with similar features in which patients were diagnosed as having ""agnogenic myeloid metaplasia,"" ""myelosclerosis,"" or ""myelofibrosis."" A brief summary of the treatment modalities used, and the clinical course and outcome of these patients are also presented. There was a marked variability in the clinical severity of the disease and in the survival of these patients. A detailed statistical analysis of 40 variables at the time of initial diagnosis showed that the factors that best predicted a poor survival were unexplained fever, weight loss, night sweats, anemia and thrombocytopenia. On the other hand, the size of the spleen or of the liver, the degree of immaturity of the peripheral blood white cells, and the degree of fibrosis or cellularity in the bone marrow biopsy were of no detectable prognostic significance. These findings suggest that in patients with unexplained fibrosis of the bone marrow (the syndrome of idiopathic myelofibrosis) a poor prognosis is not a direct consequence of the marrow fibrosis or the associated extramedullary hematopoiesis, but rather is related to the presence and/or the severity of some unexplained primary marrow defect, which is also often associated with the nonspecific symptoms of a systemic illness.","['Varki, A', 'Lottenberg, R', 'Griffith, R', 'Reinhard, E']","['Varki A', 'Lottenberg R', 'Griffith R', 'Reinhard E']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Ecchymosis/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Purpura/pathology', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Splenectomy']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 1983 Nov;62(6):353-71.,,,,,

Therefore, antileukemic agents which have no cross resistance to those used previously should be selected for relapsing cases with much more intensive fashion of treatment than that used in the prior treatment. Ninety per cent of the long-term survivors in acute leukemia who had a single relapse had survived at 7 years, whereas only 30% of the patients who had multiple relapses had survived so.

The fungal metabolite cytochalasin B (0.5 micrograms/ml) is a weak mitogen for normal lymphocytes. However, when peripheral blood lymphocytes from 19 patients with CLL of B cell origin (B-CLL) were cultured with 0.5 micrograms cytochalasin B/ml, significant new DNA synthesis ( [14C]thymidine incorporation) occurred in 18. Stimulation indices with cytochalasin B varied widely (range = 1.9-28.2, mean +/- SD = 10.6 +/- 7.5; delta cpm range = 1,157-153,818; n = 26) but in 11 cases exceeded those seen with concanavalin A (Con A), phytohemagglutinin, or pokeweed mitogen. In all 11, the mitogenic response to cytochalasin B exceeded that to pokeweed mitogen, which is believed to be a T cell-dependent B cell mitogen. In three cases, the responses to cytochalasin B were 8.6, 3.5, and 2.3 times greater than those to Con A. As with other mitogens, the DNA synthetic response to cytochalasin B was time and dose dependent. Peak thymidine incorporation occurred at 72-88 h and declined thereafter. Significant mitogenic effects were observed with 0.1-5 micrograms cytochalasin B/ml with a peak at 0.5-2 micrograms/ml. Stimulated DNA synthesis was abolished by 1 mM hydroxyurea. Cells from two patients with B-CLL were separated by rosetting with sheep erythrocytes (E). Depletion of E-rosette-positive cells from the CLL cell population abolished the response to Con A but did not affect the response to cytochalasin B. Cytochalasin B is a potent mitogen for B-CLL cells and may be useful in cytogenetic studies of this often indolent neoplasm.","['Larson, R A', 'Yachnin, S']","['Larson RA', 'Yachnin S']",['eng'],"['AM 07134-07/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 26678-03/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 18577-07/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Cytochalasin B/*pharmacology', 'Cytochalasins/pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Rosette Formation']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI111083 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1983 Oct;72(4):1268-76. doi: 10.1172/JCI111083.,"['0 (Cytochalasins)', '0 (Mitogens)', '14110-64-6 (cytochalasin A)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",PMC370411,,,

The cytostatic effect is reversible, with the degree of this reversibility dependent on both the concentration and duration of exposure to immune serum. The inhibitory factor in heat-activated goat anti-FLV gp71 (delta G alpha FLV gp71) serum has been identified as virus-specific IgG antibody, and F(ab')2 fragments of this antibody are highly effective in suppressing FLC-745 cell growth. Studies with various murine leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, as well as with a panel of antisera directed against various murine oncornaviruses or viral proteins, have demonstrated that antibodies reactive with the group or type determinants of FLV gp71 are capable of mediating cytostasis. Under conditions of antibody-mediated growth inhibition of FLC-745 cells, specific modulation of gp71 expression is followed by nonspecific modulation of H-2d antigen expression. In addition, considerable cell death occurs in cytostatic cultures which is accompanied by continued division (as measured by DNA synthesis) of a portion of the cell population. Cytofluorimetric analysis of nuclei from growth-inhibited FLC-745 cells demonstrates a diminution in the frequency of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. It is suggested that antibody-mediate FLC-745 cell growth inhibition operates via a blockade of the cell cycle which prevents most cells in the population from traversing G2/M. While these blocked cells appear to be subject to slow cytolysis by a C'-independent mechanism, a portion of the cells escape this blockade and continue to replicate, thus offsetting the death of the former cells to yield a relatively constant density of viable cells for at least 72-96 h of growth inhibition. The possible relevance of this in vitro phenomenon to in vivo passive therapy against FLV-induced disease with G alpha FLV gp71 and similar antisera is briefly considered.","['Genovesi, E V', 'Collins, J J']","['Genovesi EV', 'Collins JJ']",['eng'],['5T32CA-09111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Viral', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', '*Cell Cycle', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/microbiology/*physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041170213 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1983 Nov;117(2):215-29. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041170213.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,

The results of these preliminary pretreatment studies combined with the finding that procarbazine metabolites have antitumor activity that is equal to or greater than that of the parent drug suggest that current clinical protocols that use procarbazine along with agents capable of altering procarbazine metabolism may involve drug interactions that alter the efficacy of procarbazine as an anticancer agent.","['Shiba, D A', 'Weinkam, R J']","['Shiba DA', 'Weinkam RJ']",['eng'],"['CA-13525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-00007/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Interactions', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/*administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Phenobarbital/*administration & dosage', 'Phenytoin/*administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*therapeutic use']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00254261 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1983;11(2):124-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00254261.,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '56768KS32D (azoprocarbazine)', '6158TKW0C5 (Phenytoin)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'YQE403BP4D (Phenobarbital)']",,,,

Two P388 mouse leukaemia cell lines showing differential sensitivity to the drug have been used to investigate the transport changes associated with resistance. Resistance to daunorubicin in these cell lines occurs through an alteration in the intracellular accumulation of the drug, resulting from the increased efflux of the anthracycline from the resistant cells. The effect of temperature, drug concentration, pH, and metabolic inhibitors on this process have been investigated.

This natural membrane was chosen because cells with invasive capacities can penetrate into its loose connective tissue where their movements were recorded by time lapse cinematography. Scanning electron microscopy was utilized to better visualize shape and surface specializations of cells moving in the three localizations. Analysis of time lapse films have shown that two populations, the L5222 rat leukaemia and the V2 carcinoma of the rabbit, contain cells with translocative motility. The non-locomotive cells of these populations and all cells of the other two populations (the BNML rat leukaemia and the human tongue carcinoma cell line LICR-HN1) exhibited stationary (non-translocative) motility. These basic patterns of cell motility remained the same irrespective of the environment. Regarding the influence of the structured elements of the loose connective tissue on overall shape and surface features, it was found that cells from the two leukaemias were the least affected. While BNML cells displayed their non-locomotive activity in a spherical configuration, the translocative L5222 cells migrated in the same shape as on glass. The anterior cytoplasmic extensions, however, were smaller and less variable. The two carcinoma cell populations were more influenced in both shape and cytoplasmic extensions. The well-spread configuration assumed by the stationary LICR-HN1 cells on glass was not maintained in the tissue. There the cells were more spherical. V2 carcinoma cells locomoting within the mesentery showed an increased ability to adapt their shape to the structured environment. The large leading lamellae, characteristic for V2 cells moving on glass, were not evident in the mesentery. They were replaced by smaller and longer cytoplasmic extensions. These observations indicate that the display of cellular locomotion as such does not depend on the environment. The latter, however, can induce adaptations of the cells' locomotive machinery which are expressed as modifications of overall shape and surface features.","['Haemmerli, G', 'Arnold, B', 'Strauli, P']","['Haemmerli G', 'Arnold B', 'Strauli P']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biol Int Rep,Cell biology international reports,7708050,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Movement', 'Glass', 'Leukemia', 'Rats']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0309-1651(83)90199-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Int Rep. 1983 Sep;7(9):709-25. doi: 10.1016/0309-1651(83)90199-6.,,,,,

The 55 patients with both normal and abnormal metaphase cells had an intermediate survival. Once a complete remission had been attained, however, there was no significant difference in median survival between those patients with entirely normal karyotypes and those with abnormal karyotypes. Among the various FAB morphologic subsets of ANLL, the differences in complete remission rate and overall survival between the various cytogenetic subsets were greatest in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML, M1 + M2). The presence of an abnormal clone was a more important predictor of clinical outcome (p = 0.02) than the presence of normal stem cell clones. Aneuploidy alone (hyperdiploidy or hypodiploidy) was not of predictive value, indicating that the use of banding techniques to identify structural rearrangements in pseudodiploid cells was essential.

Characteristics of inhibition by an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of methotrexate.,123-30,"Methotrexate, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide react to form an activated ester of methotrexate which is a potent irreversible inhibitor of methotrexate transport in L1210 cells. In cells treated with the reagent at 37 degrees C, inhibition was rapid (t1/2 less than 1 min), optimal at pH 6.8, half-maximal at an inhibitor concentration of 20 nM, and complete at high levels of the reagent. Specificity was indicated by the fact that excess methotrexate added during the pretreatment step protected the transport system against inactivation. Irreversible inhibition was also observed in cells exposed to the reagent at 4 degrees C. Inactivation in this case was qualitatively similar to the corresponding process at 37 degrees C; it appeared rapidly, was half-maximal at 20 nM, and could be prevented by the addition of high concentrations of the substrate. The extent of the inhibition, however, reached a maximum of only 75%, even in samples containing excess or multiple additions of reagent. The latter findings suggest that at 4 degrees C the transport protein exists in two forms, one (75% of the total) containing binding sites which are accessible to the active ester, and the other (25% of the total) with inaccessible sites. The identity of these sites is suggested to be transport proteins which have outward and inward orientations, respectively.","['Henderson, G B', 'Montague-Wilkie, B']","['Henderson GB', 'Montague-Wilkie B']",['eng'],"['CA23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA6522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Tritium']",1983/10/26 00:00,1983/10/26 00:01,['1983/10/26 00:00'],"['1983/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(83)90267-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(83)90267-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1983 Oct 26;735(1):123-30. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(83)90267-5.,"['0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (methotrexate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,

Methionine formation only occurred in those cell lines possessing 5'-MTA phosphorylase. The kinetics of product formation indicated that 5'-MTA was first rapidly converted into 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate, followed by its slower conversion into methionine. Methionine synthesis from 5'-MTA was increased in cells previously incubated in methionine-depleted medium supplemented with 0.1 mM L-homocysteine for 24 hr. For most cell lines methionine synthesis from 5'-MTA was linear for only a short time period, and was followed by a first order decrease in the rate of methionine synthesis. Methionine synthesized from 5'-MTA was extensively incorporated into cellular macromolecules suggesting that 5'-MTA may substitute for methionine as a one-carbon source. This was confirmed by growth experiments which showed that low concentrations of 5'-MTA could partially substitute for methionine for some, but not all, cell lines. Higher concentrations of 5'-MTA were growth inhibitory. It may be possible to use 5'-MTA to selectively 'rescue' cells from methionine deprivation produced by the enzyme L-methioninase.","['Tisdale, M J']",['Tisdale MJ'],['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Deoxyadenosines', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Methionine/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Thionucleosides/*metabolism', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/metabolism']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(83)90396-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(83)90396-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1983 Oct 1;32(19):2915-20. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(83)90396-9.,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', ""634Z2VK3UQ (5'-methylthioadenosine)"", 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,,,

The reaction under these conditions retains its high specificity for Asn-Gly bonds and has the advantage that the gel matrix, acting as a carrier, facilitates simultaneous treatment of many samples, and contributes to a high recovery efficiency (60-90%) of the cleavage products. The cleavage is performed with individual protein bands excised from dried slab gels after detection by staining, autoradiography, or fluorography. The procedure can be easily combined with other techniques to further characterize the cleavage fragments. Also a two-dimensional version of the cleavage method was developed, which allows rapid recognition of interrelationships between proteins in a complicated mixture. The versatility of the procedure is demonstrated in a number of applications. Highly related strains of murine leukemia viruses were easily distinguished from one another by the unique cleavage patterns of their gag- and env-precursor polypeptides. Comparing the env-precursor gPr82env synthesized in the presence or absence of tunicamycin with its cell-free synthesized counterpart, revealed the presence of an amino-terminal signal sequence. Cleavage patterns of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) from three different species revealed a high degree of homology between rat and mouse POMC, whereas Xenopus POMC was very different. Regions to which carbohydrates are attached could be identified by comparing glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of POMC. Combining the hydroxylamine cleavage procedure with immunological characterization of the fragments showed a small but significant difference between the amino-terminal sequences of the recombinant transforming protein P120 of Abelson murine leukemia virus and of its parent molecule Pr65gag of Moloney murine leukemia virus.","['Saris, C J', 'van Eenbergen, J', 'Jenks, B G', 'Bloemers, H P']","['Saris CJ', 'van Eenbergen J', 'Jenks BG', 'Bloemers HP']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,IM,"['Animals', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/*methods', '*Hydroxylamines', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptides/*analysis', 'Pituitary Hormones, Anterior/isolation & purification', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Precursors/isolation & purification', 'Proteins/*isolation & purification', 'Rats', 'Viral Proteins/isolation & purification', 'Virion/genetics', 'Xenopus']",1983/07/01 00:00,1983/07/01 00:01,['1983/07/01 00:00'],"['1983/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003-2697(83)90425-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-2697(83)90425-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 1983 Jul 1;132(1):54-67. doi: 10.1016/0003-2697(83)90425-6.,"['0 (Hydroxylamines)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Pituitary Hormones, Anterior)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)']",,,,

In the present study, the intracellular and serum LDH levels in Hodgkin's (HD) and NHL were investigated.

This finding could explain in part the relation between high serum LDH levels and poor prognosis. It is also possible that the stage of the disease at the moment of the serum determination could be related to the serum LDH level, because a large tumor burden is likely to release more enzyme than a smaller one. However, we could not test this hypothesis because in our series there was ony one NHL patient with stage I or II. Serum LDH level could be a predictor of prognosis in NHL because of its relationship with more malignant histological types, and possibly with more advanced diseases.","['Vezzoni, M A', 'Lucchini, R', 'Giardini, R', 'Raineri, M', 'Murone, M', 'Vezzoni, P']","['Vezzoni MA', 'Lucchini R', 'Giardini R', 'Raineri M', 'Murone M', 'Vezzoni P']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology', 'Lymph Nodes/enzymology', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging']",1983/08/31 00:00,1983/08/31 00:01,['1983/08/31 00:00'],"['1983/08/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/31 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/31 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1983 Aug 31;69(4):279-82.,['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)'],,,,

A new endogenous ecotropic provirus was observed in the germ line of B6.S (Fv-2ss) mice, in addition to the resident provirus found in its congenic partner C57BL/6 (Fv-2rr). This new provirus was similar in structure to the C57BL provirus. The SIM strain of mice, the donors of the Fv-2s allele in B6.S mice, does not contain ecotropic proviruses, suggesting that the new provirus in the B6.S mouse strain arose by germ-line reintegration during the construction of this strain. Mendelian segregation analysis indicated that this new provirus was linked to the Fv-2 gene locus on chromosome 9. In three other Fv-2s congenic mouse strains--B10.C (47N), B6.C (H-7b), and C57BL/6J Trfa, Bgsd--no additional ecotropic endogenous viruses were detected, suggesting that the reinsertion event that occurred during the construction of B6.S is not essential for the acquisition of the Fv-2s phenotype in the C57BL genetic background. Although numerous reports of germ-line reinsertions of ecotropic virus in high-virus mouse strains have been received, the present results provide definitive evidence that similar germ-line amplifications of endogenous ecotropic virus can occur in a low-virus mouse strain.","['Mowat, M', 'Bernstein, A']","['Mowat M', 'Bernstein A']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*physiology', '*Genes', 'Genes, Viral', '*Genetic Linkage', 'Mice', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.47.3.471-477.1983 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1983 Sep;47(3):471-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.47.3.471-477.1983.,,PMC255288,,,

Enhancement of the antitumor effect of methotrexate and 3',5'-dichloromethotrexate by the use of lipid-soluble diesters.",1448-52,"Lipophilic methotrexate (MTX) and 3',5'-dichloromethotrexate (DCM) diesters were prepared by HCl-catalyzed esterification or by neutral esterification using cesium carbonate and an alkyl or aralkyl halide in Me2SO. The products were tested for in vivo antitumor activity against L1210 leukemia in mice to test whether all MTX and DCM diesters are therapeutically equivalent in this species. Contrary to what has been found with simple primary dialkyl esters, ortho-substituted dibenzyl esters of MTX produce longer survival on a q3dX3 schedule than does MTX itself and show a dose-sparing effect comparable to that of MTX at shorter treatment intervals. Thus, MTX bis(6-chloropiperonyl) ester at an MTX-equivalent dose of 5.5 mg/kg gave a +88% increase in median life span (ILS), whereas for MTX a +88% ILS required 30 mg/kg. When the MTX-equivalent dose of MTX bis(6-chloropiperonyl) ester was increased to 40 mg/kg, a +167% ILS was observed, as compared with a +100% ILS with 60 mg/kg of the parent drug. High activity (greater than 100% ILS) was likewise shown by the bis(2,5-dimethylbenzyl), bis(2,6-dichlorobenzyl), and di-3-picolyl esters of MTX and by the bis(1-methylbutyl) ester of DCM. The results of this study indicate that MTX and DCM esters are not therapeutically equivalent in mice, despite the high serum esterase activity in this species, and that an up to 10-fold reduction in total administered dose on the q3dX3 schedule is feasible by this approach.","['Rosowsky, A', 'Yu, C S']","['Rosowsky A', 'Yu CS']",['eng'],"['CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Esters', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Methods', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00364a017 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1983 Oct;26(10):1448-52. doi: 10.1021/jm00364a017.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Esters)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', ""528-74-5 (3',5'-dichloromethotrexate)"", 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,

Cases of acquired idiopathic sideroblastic anaemia (AISA) usually had normal leucocyte and platelet counts, erythroid hyperplasia, marked dyserythropoiesis and more than 20% ringed sideroblasts. Cases of refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) had frequent neutropenia and thrombopenia usually with prominent dysgranulopoiesis and dysthrombopoiesis. Refractory anaemia or refractory cytopenia appeared morphologically to be a heterogeneous group. Leukaemic transformation did not occur in any of these 16 cases of AISA whereas six of the 34 cases of RAEB transformed into acute leukaemia.

In L1210/LN-1 cells, no human chromosomes were identified and chromosomes M1 and No. 1 carried by the parent L1210 cells were missing. L1210/LN-1 cells displayed an intermediate morphology between L1210 cells and Lesch-Nyhan fibroblasts.

The CDF1 mice which rejected 2 X 10(6) L1210/LN-1 cells were protected very effectively against challenge of otherwise highly aggressive 1-5 X 10(5) L1210 leukemia cells; 40 out of 43 primed mice tested survived for 60 days or longer after the tumor challenge. Even the CDF1 mice primed with irradiated or mitomycin-treated L1210/LN-1 cells survived against a challenge of 10(5) L1210 leukemia cells. They were, however, not protected against P388 leukemia or Meth A sarcoma, indicating that the immunity was specific to L1210 leukemia. The immunity induced by L1210/LN-1 cells was transplantable by immune spleen cells into syngeneic recipients. Thus, the L1210/LN-1 cells we obtained seem to be very useful as an immunogen for generation of high-grade tumor-specific immunity against highly malignant L1210 leukemia.","['Kawashima, K', 'Nagura, E', 'Watanabe, E', 'Mizoguchi, K', 'Saga, S', 'Isobe, K', 'Nakashima, I', 'Yamada, K', 'Oikawa, T', 'Kojima, K']","['Kawashima K', 'Nagura E', 'Watanabe E', 'Mizoguchi K', 'Saga S', 'Isobe K', 'Nakashima I', 'Yamada K', 'Oikawa T', 'Kojima K']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Immunization', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Karyotyping', 'Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome/*immunology', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",1983/10/15 00:00,1983/10/15 00:01,['1983/10/15 00:00'],"['1983/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910320419 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1983 Oct 15;32(4):507-14. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910320419.,,,,,

High temperatures potentiate whereas a slight decrease in temperature reduces leukemic cell destruction by ALP. At temperatures below 30 degrees C even high doses of ALP will not destroy these tumor cells. Furthermore, cell destruction initiated at 37 degrees C can be abolished by lowering the incubation temperature to 25 degrees C. These biological data have been confirmed by biochemical studies, showing a temperature dependence of ALP adsorption not accompanied by a corresponding increase of alkyl-cleavage enzyme activity.

Compounds 1, 2 and 3 gave Michael type 1:1 addition products. Compound 4 reacted with AcCys by a three step mechanism; the primary addition product 8 underwent an unusual elimination reaction giving the unsaturated compound 9, which yielded the addition product 10 with AcCys. In the reaction with GSH, compound 4 behaved like a bifunctional SH alkylating agent. Compounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 also reacted with protein thiols as shown by their ability to inhibit lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Unsaturated ketonucleosides had diversified effect on L1210 leukemia cells. While the most potent cytostatics, compounds 1 and 3, reduced considerably the membrane surface SH level, they were without effect on soluble intracellular protein thiols. In contrast, nucleosides 2 and 4, less active than the former, only slightly affected the membrane surface sulfhydryls and considerably depleted the intracellular soluble protein thiols. Only slight differences were found between the reactions of the four nucleosides with non-protein SH (NPSH). The correlation found between in vivo biological activity and cell membrane impairment suggests that selective alkylation of certain key membrane thiols by unsaturated ketonucleosides might be an important event in their biological effect.","['Halmos, T', 'Cardon, A', 'Antonakis, K']","['Halmos T', 'Cardon A', 'Antonakis K']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Ketones', 'Kinetics', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleosides/*toxicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*metabolism', 'Sulfhydryl Reagents/*toxicity']",1983/08/15 00:00,1983/08/15 00:01,['1983/08/15 00:00'],"['1983/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0009-2797(83)90003-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0009-2797(83)90003-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 1983 Aug 15;46(1):11-29. doi: 10.1016/0009-2797(83)90003-0.,"['0 (Ketones)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Reagents)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,

HP in the dark prior to and during LPAM exposure did not modify the LPAM response curve. The actinomycin D response curve was modified by prior HP and light treatment to indicate an additive effect of one additional log; a synergistic effect may be present in the range of 100 to 10% cloning efficiencies.

The substitution of homocystine for methionine in the diet of untreated animals led to a significant increase in S-adenosylhomocysteine and decrease in S-adenosylmethionine in the liver, with a resultant profound decrease in the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine which was not further altered significantly by administration of methotrexate.","['Hilton, M A', 'Hoffman, J L', 'Sparks, M K']","['Hilton MA', 'Hoffman JL', 'Sparks MK']",['eng'],['CA 24108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Diet', 'Homocysteine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Homocystine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia L5178/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Liver/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/*metabolism', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/*metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*therapeutic use']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Nov;43(11):5210-6.,"['0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '462-10-2 (Homocystine)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)', 'TYK22LML8F (5-methyltetrahydrofolate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,

The extract inhibited tumor formation in CBA/H mice which had been given i.p. injections of 1.0 X 10(5) CBA/Dl tumor cells (77% of the untreated mice with tumors versus 33% of the treated mice with tumors after 6 weeks). The extract also inhibited tumor formation in DBA/2 mice which had been given i.p. injections of either 1 X 10(5) P388 tumor cells (0% of untreated mice survived after 30 days versus 40% survival of the treated mice) or 1 X 10(5) L1210 tumor cells (0% survival of untreated mice versus 100% of treated mice after 30 days). The in vivo antitumor effect required both the prior exposure of tumor cells to the extract (2 hr) in vitro and i.p., biweekly injections of the extract into the mice. The optimum dose for tumor inhibition (8 micrograms protein, biweekly, i.p.) was not toxic to mice for at least 45 days of treatment. This same treatment caused a marked enhancement of C3H mouse thymic cell response to concanavalin A in vitro. When compared to the untreated control mice, the bitter melon-injected animals exhibited a 4-fold-higher incorporation of tritiated thymidine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material after 48 hr of exposure to 50 micrograms of concanavalin A. Nylon wool-purified spleen cells from these same bitter melon-treated mice exhibited an enhanced mixed lymphocyte reaction when exposed to irradiated P388 stimulator cells (186% of the untreated control mice). These data indicate that in vivo enhancement of immune functions may contribute to the antitumor effects of the bitter melon extract.","['Jilka, C', 'Strifler, B', 'Fortner, G W', 'Hays, E F', 'Takemoto, D J']","['Jilka C', 'Strifler B', 'Fortner GW', 'Hays EF', 'Takemoto DJ']",['eng'],"['CA 24196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 27500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', '*Plants, Medicinal']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Nov;43(11):5151-5.,['0 (Plant Extracts)'],,,,

The first system studied was that of the DBA/2-derived T-lymphoma lines (Eb/ESb) and some recently established sublines of ESb with altered metastatic behavior (ESb-M and ESb-MR). The second system consisted of the highly metastatic MDAY-D2 cells, a wheat germ agglutinin-resistant low metastatic subline MDW40, and two metastatic revertants from the latter. The cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated lectins and analyzed by flow cytofluorography. All low-metastatic tumor lines expressed receptor sites for the lectins soybean agglutinin (SBA) and Vicia villosa (VV). The metastatic lines had the respective lectin binding sites blocked by sialic acid (SA). A good correlation was found within the cell lineages Eb leads to ESb leads to ESb-M leads to ESb-MR and MDAY-D2 leads to MDW40 leads to MDW40M1 between reactivity of SBA and VV and metastatic potential. The amount of neuraminidase-accessible SA was similar for all cell types (except MDW40) indicating differences in the positioning of SA. For high-metastatic ESb cells, the sialylation of SBA and VV receptor sites was paralleled by a relative decrease of SA associated with receptor sites for peanut agglutinin. Low-metastatic Eb cells, in contrast, had their peanut agglutinin receptor sites sialylated but expressed asialylated SBA and VV receptor sites. Eb cells were also found to have 2-fold higher activities in galactose-specific sialyltransferases. It is proposed that the differences in positioning of SA on the cell surface leading to masking or unmasking of terminal sugars could influence the metastatic potential of tumor cells.","['Altevogt, P', 'Fogel, M', 'Cheingsong-Popov, R', 'Dennis, J', 'Robinson, P', 'Schirrmacher, V']","['Altevogt P', 'Fogel M', 'Cheingsong-Popov R', 'Dennis J', 'Robinson P', 'Schirrmacher V']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Membrane/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hexosyltransferases/metabolism', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia L5178/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*metabolism', 'Sialic Acids/*analysis', 'Sialyltransferases/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Nov;43(11):5138-44.,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Hexosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)']",,,,

When ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides were examined for their effects on 3'-NH2-dCyd-induced cytotoxicity, only dCyd could both prevent and reverse these effects. Furthermore, even when the maximum increase in modal cell volume was allowed to develop (24 hr) in the presence of 2.5 microM 3'-NH2-dCyd, the addition of 25 microM dCyd to the medium containing 3'-NH2-dCyd reduced the modal cell volume nearly to control levels within 24 hr. Examination of the viability of these cells by colony formation in soft agar, following as much as a 9.5-hr exposure of 1, 2.5 and 10 microM 3'-NH2-dCyd, revealed that the lethal effects of the 3'-NH2-dCyd treatment were not observed only when 25 microM dCyd was added to the medium during this time. However, the lethality of a 24-hr exposure of 2.5 and 10 microM 3'-NH2-dCyd could not be prevented either by removal of the drug from the medium or by a 24-hr exposure of the medium containing 3'-NH2-dCyd to 25 microM dCyd.

Although insertion of the dual lumen catheter was more technically demanding than insertion of a single lumen catheter, the greater versatility in drug management (e.g., administration of two continuous infusions simultaneously or one continuous infusion leaving one line for platelets, blood, antibiotics or venous sampling) provided by the extra venous portal of entry more than compensated for any increased operative time (average, 58 vs 39 min/insertion).

The amount of DNA-protein crosslinks as measured by a filter binding assay is dose dependent upon X irradiation. Although hyperthermia and radiation in combination are synergistic with respect to cell lethality, the combination does not result in an increase of DNA-protein crosslinks when assayed immediately following treatments. Hyperthermia (43 degrees C/15 min) given prior to radiation does not alter the radiation dose dependency of the amount of initial crosslinking. In addition, the amount of DNA-protein crosslinking produced by heat plus radiation is independent of the length of heating the cells at 43 degrees C. The DNA-protein crosslinks produced by 50-Gy X ray alone are removed after 2 hr at 37 degrees C. However, if hyperthermia (43 degrees C/15 min) is given prior to 100-Gy X ray, the removal of DNA-protein crosslinks is delayed until 4.0 hr after radiation. Phospho-serine and phospho-threonine bonds are not produced with either radiation or the combination of hyperthermia plus radiation as judged by the resistance of the bonds to guanidine hydrochloride. However, hyperthermia plus radiation causes an increase in phosphate to nitrogen type bonding. These results show that radiation alone causes covalent DNA-protein crosslinks. Hyperthermia in combination with radiation does not increase the total amount of the crosslinks but delays the removal of the crosslinks and alters the distribution of the types of chemical bonding. These data suggest that the synergistic action on hyperthermia with radiation is more related to the rate of removal and the type of chemical bonding involved in the covalent DNA-protein crosslinks rather than the amount of DNA-protein crosslinks.","['Cress, A E', 'Bowden, G T']","['Cress AE', 'Bowden GT']",['eng'],"['CA-17343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26972/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/analysis/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Guanidine', 'Guanidines/pharmacology', '*Hot Temperature', 'Hydroxylamine', 'Hydroxylamines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Proteins/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Time Factors', 'Urea/pharmacology']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1983 Sep;95(3):610-9.,"['0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Hydroxylamines)', '0 (Proteins)', '2FP81O2L9Z (Hydroxylamine)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'JU58VJ6Y3B (Guanidine)']",,,,

In the lymphoblastic group the leukaemic cells of 4 children were found to have T-cell phenotype, while 19 of the other 20 T-cell phenotype negative cases were found to be positive for the c-ALL antigen. All 20 were negative for surface immunoglobulin as well as cytoplasmic mu-heavy chains. However, 17 (85%) reacted positively with the monoclonal antibody AB-1 which we have developed against a B-cell lymphoma, thus revealing B-lineage specificity. Another B-lineage-associated antibody (AB-2) reacted with 8/20 (40%) of the cases with distribution similar to B-1. These findings suggest that the great majority of non-T-non-B acute lymphoblastic leukaemias are neoplasms derived from the B-cell progenitor compartment. Moreover, monoclonal antibody testing allows further sub-categorization in this group. Similarly the acute-myelogenous leukaemia group could be subdivided into phenotypic subsets.

One such defect is a dysfunction of normal antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation of T lymphocytes after whole body or in vitro UV. Although the mechanism of this interaction is not clearly defined, several possibilities have been suggested. One proposal is that UV may inhibit or abrogate the APC IL 1 signal and thus prevent normal T cell activation. To investigate this possibility further, we examined the functional consequences of UV on murine peritoneal adherent cell (PAC) activation of a cloned antigen-specific T cell hybridoma (A2.2.E10). In agreement with previous reports, we found a marked UV-induced inhibition of PAC activation of A2.2.E10 after sublethal UV. To correlate this UV-APC dysfunction with UV alterations of IL 1 production, both the IL 1-producing murine macrophage cell line P388D1 and normal murine PAC were exposed to various amounts of in vitro UV and the 24-hr post-UV IL 1 activity production of these cells was determined. The results surprisingly indicated that certain amounts of sublethal UV may actually augment the production of IL 1 activity, by using a dose range that clearly inhibits antigen presentation. This UV-induced activity was cycloheximide-sensitive, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis rather than release from cells was responsible for the increased IL 1 activity. In addition, the UV-induced IL 1 activity had a m.w. of 14K, consistent with previous reports, and demonstrated pyrogen activity when tested in the rabbit pyrogen assay. Thus UV clearly inhibits normal APC function; however, this may not be due to abrogation of IL 1 production, but rather the result of UV toxicity for other complex events involved in antigen presentation.","['Ansel, J', 'Luger, T A', 'Kock, A', 'Hochstein, D', 'Green, I']","['Ansel J', 'Luger TA', 'Kock A', 'Hochstein D', 'Green I']",['eng'],['AMO7465-01/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/immunology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia P388/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/radiation effects', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Proteins/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Ultraviolet Rays/adverse effects']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 Sep;133(3):1350-5.,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (leukocyte endogenous mediator)']",,,,

This event, the MER-switch, is quantified by inhibition of rosette formation. By using [3H]phorbol dibutyrate ([3H]PDBu), both to stimulate MER-switch and assay binding of PDBu to CLL cells, it was shown that MER-switch was an irreversible, time-dependent event which occurred some time after maximal binding of [3H]PDBu to cells. Two classes of binding sites, one of high affinity (Kd 1 to 2 nM) at low frequency (1.5 to 5 X 10(4) sites per cell), and a lower affinity site (Kd 33 to 50 nM) of higher frequency (2 to 3.5 X 10(5) sites per cell), were detected. Binding of [3H]PDBu was inhibited by phorbol ester analogs that stimulated MER-switch, but not by inactive analogs. This, and the similarity in shapes of the binding and rosette inhibition curves over a range of concentrations, suggests that stimulation of MER-switch by phorbol esters is due to this specific binding. The phorbol ester receptor and MER are distinct because MER-ve T cells and MER-ve atypical B cells from a patient with CLL had both classes of PDBu receptor. Solubilized MER did not bind [3H]PDBu. Time-course studies, and the irreversibility of the switch, despite removal of most of the bound [3H]PDBu, indicate that inhibition of rosetting is not due to competitive or steric hindrance by phorbol esters. Equivalent activities of soluble MER were released from fresh and phorbol ester-treated CLL cells, indicating a rearrangement of MER, rather than a loss. A supernatant of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human spleen cells also induced MER-switch in CLL lymphocytes, suggesting that a lymphokine may be a natural inducer of this event.","['Zalewski, P D', 'Forbes, I J', 'Valente, L', 'Comacchio, R']","['Zalewski PD', 'Forbes IJ', 'Valente L', 'Comacchio R']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Carcinogens', '*Diterpenes', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis/drug effects', '*Rosette Formation', 'Terpenes/pharmacology']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 Sep;133(3):1278-82.,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Terpenes)', '34807-41-5 (mezerein)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)']",,,,

Simultaneously, the conjugating MNC were analysed in suspension by monoclonal antibodies (mAb) defining subsets of T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes (OKT 8, OKT 4, Leu 7, OKM 1, Mo 2). It is demonstrated that the pattern of conjugating (binding, lysis) is dependent upon the proliferative status of the target cell population. Target cells of intermediate division rate are optimally lysed by MNC of NK phenotype, whereas targets of high and low division rate bind cells predominantly of T cell phenotype, but are not killed. Non-cytolytic conjugating MNC are shown to inhibit significantly the cell cycle progression of their bound tumour target cells. There is evidence of an additional cytostatic effect on non-bound K562 cells in agarose dishes containing effector MNC, possibly mediated by soluble factors released from NK cells. Adherent monocytes contribute only little to cytolysis and cytostasis in our testing system. There is no correlation between the expression of transferrin receptors on target cells as determined by the OKT9 mAb and the extent of killing.

Hence these might play a role in some situations of biological interest.","['Mege, J L', 'Capo, C', 'Benoliel, A M', 'Foa, C', 'Bongrand, P']","['Mege JL', 'Capo C', 'Benoliel AM', 'Foa C', 'Bongrand P']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunol Commun,Immunological communications,0353016,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Communication', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'Erythrocytes/cytology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Mathematics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sheep', '*Surface Properties', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', '*Water']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08820138409025463 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Commun. 1984;13(3):211-27. doi: 10.3109/08820138409025463.,['059QF0KO0R (Water)'],,,,

We have investigated the role of 5'-methylthioadenosine on the dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation of this system. At a concentration of 400 microM, the drug strongly inhibited (80%) the induced differentiation of Friend cells, and this effect was already observable at a concentration as low as 10 microM (36% inhibition), as evidenced by the benzidine staining procedure and by the dot-blot hybridization of globin mRNA with a human beta-globin probe. Similar results have been obtained by using 5'-S-isobutylthioadenosine, which is a synthetic structural analogue of 5'-methylthioadenosine. The block of differentiation produced by these nucleosides was not mediated by adenine (a catabolite of both molecules) and was not reverted by spermine or spermidine, the two polyamines whose synthesis is inhibited by 5'-methylthioadenosine. We report a decrease of the aminopropyltransferases activities (the enzymes responsible for 5'-methylthioadenosine biosynthesis) in dimethyl sulfoxide-treated Friend cells, which could lead to a decrease of the intracellular content of 5'-methylthioadenosine during the erythroid maturation of Friend cells. The results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis that 5'-methylthioadenosine may act as an endogenous regulator of Friend cell differentiation.","['Di Fiore, P P', 'Grieco, M', 'Pinto, A', 'Attadia, V', 'Porcelli, M', 'Cacciapuoti, G', 'Carteni-Farina, M']","['Di Fiore PP', 'Grieco M', 'Pinto A', 'Attadia V', 'Porcelli M', 'Cacciapuoti G', 'Carteni-Farina M']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Deoxyadenosines/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Globins/genetics', 'Heme/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/isolation & purification', 'Thionucleosides/*pharmacology']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Sep;44(9):4096-103.,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', ""35899-54-8 (5'-deoxy-5'-S-isobutylthioadenosine)"", '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', ""634Z2VK3UQ (5'-methylthioadenosine)"", '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,

Our study investigates blastic transformation and surface antigen change on CTCL cells in vitro under the influence of tumor-promoting phorbol ester (TPA) and phytohemagglutinin. Both agents transformed tumor cells with cerebriform nuclei into blast cells within 5 days; however, Sezary cells were somewhat resistant to transformation with phytohemagglutinin. Multinucleated cells with prominent nucleoli resembled Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin's disease. These morphological changes simulated the appearance of the aggressive tumor stage of mycosis fungoides. During blastic transformation, the erythrocyte rosette receptor was induced by TPA on sheep erythrocyte-rosette-negative Sezary cells from one patient. During the first 24 hr in vitro, Sezary and MF cells stimulated by TPA lost Leu 3a (T4) antigen while maintaining original high levels of Leu 1 antigen. In contrast, leukemia cells from patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) were resistant to modulation of Leu 3a antigen by TPA; 3A1 antigen on CTCL and ATL cells was unaffected by TPA. Blastic transformation of CTCL cells was observed with both TPA and phytohemagglutinin, but helper T-cell antigen Leu 3a (T4) and erythrocyte rosette receptor changes occurred only with TPA. Thus, blastic transformation and surface differentiation were not directly related. These results provide a possible model for the study of blastic transformation and surface antigen/receptor variation in CTCL. They also may provide an independent test for the distinction of CTCL and ATL in vitro. Finally, they illustrate the relative resistance of ATL to surface antigen modulation as previously shown for Tac antigen modulation by anti-Tac antibody.","['Kadin, M E', 'Nasu, K', 'Sako, D', 'Su, I J']","['Kadin ME', 'Nasu K', 'Sako D', 'Su IJ']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Phenotype', 'Phorbols/*toxicity', 'Sezary Syndrome/immunology/*physiopathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*toxicity']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Aug;44(8):3383-7.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Phorbols)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,

All cases were defined by cytochemistry, immunological markers and transmission electron microscopy prior to SEM examination. B-CLL cells showed the well-recognized spectrum of surface architecture described in earlier studies. The majority of cells had moderate numbers of short microvilli, although in a minority, cells with relatively smooth surfaces predominated. In seven of the eight cases of PL-CLL, cells were villous in nature and in this respect similar to CLL cells; however, more cells with dense microvilli were seen. The prolymphocytic cells were recognized by their larger size and in 18 of the 19 cases of B-derived PLL, villous cells predominated. Two cases of T-derived PLL showed variable cell surface morphology ranging from smooth to moderately villous.

For man, the only known B-cell mitogen independent of accessory cells for its action is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Lymphocytes transformed by EBV are released from the usual constraints on B-cell growth, proliferating continuously in the absence of any exogenous cytokine. The resultant cell lines are of special interest as they possess certain features compatible with a preneoplastic state of Burkitt's lymphoma, one of two human cancers with which the virus is intimately associated. We report here that following EBV-transformation, B lymphoblasts release a soluble factor which mimics the B-cell stimulatory product(s) of mitogen-conditioned T lymphocytes. Furthermore, the virally-transformed cells utilize this activity to sustain their own growth. The ectopic production of an otherwise normal growth factor may represent a critical event in the malignant evolution of human lymphomas harbouring the EBV genome.","['Gordon, J', 'Ley, S C', 'Melamed, M D', 'English, L S', 'Hughes-Jones, N C']","['Gordon J', 'Ley SC', 'Melamed MD', 'English LS', 'Hughes-Jones NC']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication', 'Growth Substances/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Palatine Tonsil/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1984/07/12 00:00,1984/07/12 00:01,['1984/07/12 00:00'],"['1984/07/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/12 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/310145a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1984 Jul 12-18;310(5973):145-7. doi: 10.1038/310145a0.,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,

Both B3/25 and OKT-9, anti-transferrin receptor antibodies, reacted with all of the hematopoietic and neuroblastoma cell lines. These results demonstrate that neuroblastoma and hematopoietic cell lines possess common antigenic determinants despite their different embryologic origins. The neuroblastoma cell lines may be classified into subgroups on the basis of phenotype profiles determined by the MoAb.

Diminished L-system transport in chronic leukemic B lymphocytes.,17-24,"We have examined the amino acid transport in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and compared it with the amino acid transport in isolated B lymphocytes from human blood and tonsils. L-system transport was measured with 2-amino-2-carboxy-bicyclo (2,2,1)-heptane, which is a synthetic amino acid whose transport is limited to the L-system. Amino acid uptake was subjected to a multicomponent analysis that partitioned the total uptake into the saturable carrier-mediated transport system and the uptake by diffusion. The maximal velocity of L-system transport in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, 81 mumol/1 cell water per min, was less than 10% that of blood B lymphocytes, which was 1,029 mumol/1 cell water per min. The uptake of 2-amino-2-carboxy-bicyclo (2,2,1)-heptane by tonsillar B cells, by a B lymphocyte cell line, and by blood T-lymphocytes was also 10-fold greater than that observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemic cells. Similarly, the L-system uptake of leucine and phenylalanine, which are naturally occurring amino acids usually transported primarily by the L-system, was reduced in chronic lymphocytic leukemic B cells to 15 and 10% of normal B cells, respectively. Total leucine uptake by chronic lymphocytic leukemic cells, however, was sustained at 30% of that expected because of transport via an alternative transport system. The A- or ASC-systems, the other major amino acid transport pathways, were not defective in chronic lymphocytic leukemic cells. These data indicate that there is a specific, profound decrease in L-system carrier-mediated amino acid transport in chronic lymphocytic leukemic B cells, as judged by the system-specific synthetic amino acid, 2-amino-2-carboxy-bicyclo (2,2,1)-heptane. This defect was confirmed by studies with two naturally occurring L-system amino acids, leucine and phenylalanine. This specific abnormality of membrane transport by chronic lymphocytic leukemic B lymphocytes is not shared by other B lymphocyte types, and thus appears to be related to the neoplastic nature of the leukemic B cells rather than to their immunologic subtype.","['Segel, G B', 'Simon, W', 'Lichtman, M A']","['Segel GB', 'Simon W', 'Lichtman MA']",['eng'],"['CA12970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Amino Acids/*metabolism', 'Aminoisobutyric Acids/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Palatine Tonsil', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI111398 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1984 Jul;74(1):17-24. doi: 10.1172/JCI111398.,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Aminoisobutyric Acids)', '2566-34-9 (2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",PMC425180,,,

In addition to BNU, groups of mice received multiple injections of the interferon inducer CP during or after the BNU exposure period. The results show a slight impairment of the NK cell activity by BNU and also after the injections of CP depending heavily on the treatment protocol. After the multiple injections of CP, either into BNU-treated mice or into controls, no further stimulation by CP was possible. The mitogen responses, reduced after BNU, were further reduced after the additional treatment. Both effects can be explained by the known induction of suppressor cells by CP.

However, cytotoxicity blocking studies suggested that NKTa and NKTb may represent functionally distinct epitopes of this 90-kDa molecule. Anti-NKTa uniformly blocked the cytotoxicity of both JT9 and JT10 cells when tested against 11 randomly selected target cell lines. In contrast, anti-NKTb totally blocked the cytotoxicity of these cloned cells against some targets (i.e., HPB-ALL, Nalm-1) but had very little effect when cytotoxicity was measured against other target cells (i.e., K562, U937, KG-1). This selective blocking effect, therefore, supports the notion that the heterodimer defined by the NKT antibodies is involved in the process of target cell recognition rather than in the cytolytic pathway of the cloned effector cells. Moreover, the unique functional effects of anti-NKTb suggest that additional levels of complexity exist in the specific recognition mechanisms of these clonal populations of NK active mature T lymphocytes.","['Hercend, T', 'Meuer, S', 'Brennan, A', 'Edson, M A', 'Acuto, O', 'Reinherz, E L', 'Schlossman, S F', 'Ritz, J']","['Hercend T', 'Meuer S', 'Brennan A', 'Edson MA', 'Acuto O', 'Reinherz EL', 'Schlossman SF', 'Ritz J']",['eng'],"['CA 25369/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(84)90393-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(84)90393-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1984 Jul;86(2):381-92. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(84)90393-9.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,,,

A partial lymph node involvement is often observed with a persistent sinusal pattern and residual germinative follicles (39 from 48 cases or 80%). The tumoral infiltration begins in the deep cortex and in the interfollicular areas. Some reactive lesions of dermopathic lymphadenopathy are frequently associated. The main histological feature is the cellular pleomorphism. Nevertheless 4 cytological variants may be described according to the predominant proliferating cells: a small cell variant, a large cell variant, a mixed cell variant comprising an equivalent proportion of small medium and large-sized cells, an immunoblastic variant with majority of immunoblasts and some Sternberg-like tumoral cells. Any form may be associated with granuloma which increase polymorphism. In some histological variants, so-called Lutzner cells are numerous and facilitate the diagnosis of epidermotropic malignant T lymphoma. Nevertheless, some cases may be discussed with centrocytic or centroblastic centrocytic lymphomas, with Pinkus multilobulated T lymphoma or with convoluted lymphoblastic lymphoma. More difficult is the distinction from Lennert T - zone lymphomas and from adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia described in Japan. The immunoblastic variant may be mistaken with some high-grade malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with an angio-immunoblastic lymphadenopathy, even with a metastatic carcinoma. The evidence of granuloma with numerous eosinophiles frequently observed in the Hodgkin-like variant is a cause of confusion with Hodgkin's disease. A good help would be supplied by the discover of some Lutzner cells among the granuloma. No correlation was found between these histological variants and the M.F. evolution.

Unlike normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes, which require the presence of granulocytes for a maximal DNA synthetic response to mevalonic acid, CLL cells do not require a helper cell. Only the physiologically active R(-) enantiomer of mevalonic acid is active in initiating DNA synthesis, and no stimulatory effect is noted after addition of the precursors of mevalonic acid or of its known products. The mitogenic responses to mevalonic acid measured in CLL cells from 35 patients varied widely (range of stimulation indices, 1.2-18.6), but the DNA synthetic response of CLL cells from 9 patients to mevalonic acid exceeded those seen with such common lymphocyte mitogens as concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, poke-weed mitogen, or a phorbol ester. The mevalonate-responsive CLL cell was enriched in the E(-), M(+) rosette subpopulation. When CLL cells were incubated in lipoprotein-depleted serum-containing medium, the presence of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increased their sensitivity to mevalonic acid transformation, suggesting that a nonsterol product of mevalonic acid metabolism may be involved.

Furthermore, neoglycoprotein -bound MDP injected i.v. or i.p. was found to be able to activate alveolar macrophages, the activity of which was maximal after 48 hours in mice and 72 hours in rats.

The other proteins are taken up by the cells. The concentration of alpha 1-antitrypsin in serum and cells was correlated in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and the acute phase, suggesting either that the same signal for synthesis is used in the liver and leucocytes, or that a balance is kept by means of leucocyte uptake. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia lymphocytes contained only traces of albumin, which may be related to the decreased membrane mobility of these cells. Polycythemia leucocytes, however, contained increased concentrations of all plasma proteins, especially orosomucoid and haptoglobin2 . These two protein forms were found to be markers of mature granulocytes. The cellular concentrations of prealbumin, albumin and transferrin were about 35% of normal in acute myeloid leukaemia cells and no orosomucoid2 and haptoglobin2 was present.

WT1 identified a monomeric cell surface glycoprotein of Mr = 40,000 ( gp40 ). Cross-absorption experiments and two-dimensional gel analyses indicate that WT1 and another monoclonal antibody, 3A1, react with the same structure. This glycoprotein was asymmetrically inserted into the rough endoplasmic reticulum as a transmembrane structure. At this stage, the polypeptide chain possessed two N-linked, ""high-mannose"" type glycans; these were subsequently processed into endo-H-insensitive, complex oligosaccharides during intracellular transport to the cell surface. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin failed to block the processing of the nonglycosylated Mr = 29,000 polypeptide to a glycoprotein of Mr = 33,000. Cleavage of the mature Mr = 40,000 form with endo-F yielded a similar Mr = 33,000 product. The kinetics of synthesis of the Mr = 33,000 intermediate in conjunction with gal-NAc oligosaccharidase digestion indicated the presence of O-linked glycans in the mature cell surface WT1 antigen. The fully processed cell surface form of the polypeptide also contains covalently associated fatty acid, and was labeled by 32P phosphate, the predominantly labeled phosphoamino acid being phosphoserine. We also demonstrate biochemically that the reactivity of WT1 with cells from a few patients with acute myeloid leukemia reflects genuine expression of the gp40 structure on myeloid cells.","['Sutherland, D R', 'Rudd, C E', 'Greaves, M F']","['Sutherland DR', 'Rudd CE', 'Greaves MF']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Glycoproteins/analysis/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Microsomes/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Palmitic Acid', 'Palmitic Acids/metabolism', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 Jul;133(1):327-33.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Palmitic Acids)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)']",,,,

In vivo and in vitro experiments show that the emergent-phenotype tumor cells are less capable than ""original""-phenotype cells, which constitute the majority of the L5178Y cell inoculum, of restimulating cytolytic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity in tumor-dormant mice and are less susceptible to lysis by those CTL. Both original- and emergent-phenotype tumor cells are capable of eliciting an immune CTL response in naive mice, but again emergent-phenotype cells are poorly lysed by this response. As a consequence of these characteristics, emergent-phenotype cells rapidly form ascitic tumors when used as a challenge in L5178Y cell-immunized mice and cannot establish a tumor-dormant state. Results presented here and in previous publications indicate that CTLs are the major host cells involved in the selection of emergent-phenotype L5178Y cells during the course of the tumor-dormant state. Heterogeneity of the tumor cell challenge inoculum is important in establishing the L5178Y tumor-dormant state. The state, once established, is maintained by an immune CTL response which is continuously being restimulated by the strongly immunogenic original-phenotype L5178Y cells.

Both CF and TIA were capable of protecting mice from MTX dosages up to 2000 mg/kg. Treatment of L1210-bearing mice with 2000 mg/kg MTX plus CF or TIA produced a 70 and 100% increase in life span, respectively, compared with 29% increase in life span achieved with the maximally tolerated dose of MTX alone. Bioassay of surviving peritoneal L1210 cells showed that a 4.5-log tumor kill occurred 24 hr after 2000 mg/kg MTX, while 400 mg/kg MTX produced only a 2-log cell kill. This differential tumor kill in the 4-hr period after MTX and prior to the onset of rescue accounted for the observed increase in animal survival times. In addition, treatment with 2000 mg/kg MTX resulted in a one-log-greater tumor kill of cells metastasized to the brain than did treatment with 400 mg/kg MTX. Following 2000 mg/kg MTX, additional tumor kill, as measured by bioassay, occurred during the period of TIA rescue but not during CF rescue, which was consistent with the observed differences in survival times between CF- and TIA-rescued mice. DNA synthesis in tumor and host tissue, as measured by the rate of [3H]dCyd incorporation into DNA, was cyclic after TIA administration but not after CF administration.

In contrast, antigens that were B cell associated were also found on tumors of other lineages. Moreover, on the basis of cell surface phenotypes, tumors of B cell origin were divided into three major subgroups, which corresponded to the level of differentiation of the malignant tumor cell: pre-B cell stage (non-T acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelocytic leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis); the mid-B cell stage (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, poorly differentiated lymphomas); and secretory B cell stage (large cell lymphomas and plasma cell tumors).

In normal individuals, assays using enriched T cells did not reveal the total number of potential colony forming cells, preventing accurate assessment in patients with B cell CLL where enriched T cells are mandatory. Conditions were therefore optimized to obtain the maximal number of colonies, so that accurate comparisons could be made between the potential of normal individuals and patients with CLL. Addition of normal autologous non-T cells to enriched T cells enhanced colony numbers in normal individuals to those seen in the whole mononuclear population. However, addition of normal non-T cells to CLL T cells would have caused a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), which influences T cell colony numbers. Therefore the MLR was bypassed by adding to the enriched T cells, supernatants having characteristics of Interleukin-1 or commercially obtained Interleukin-2. The supernatants with Interleukin-1 activity enhanced T cell colony numbers comparably in both normal individuals and patients with CLL. Interleukin-2 did not increase T cell colony numbers in normal individuals and the increase seen in patients with CLL were not significant. Thus the effect of the lymphokines on T cell colony numbers was comparable in both normal individuals and untreated patients with CLL. We therefore concluded that there are normal numbers of cells which have the potential to form T cell colonies in untreated patients with CLL.","['Fernandez, L A', 'MacSween, J M', 'Langley, G R']","['Fernandez LA', 'MacSween JM', 'Langley GR']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1984 May;57(1):97-104.,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,,

To explore more extensively the T cell status of B-CLL patients, surface immunoglobulin-negative cells were isolated by sheep erythrocyte rosetting (ER) and the membrane phenotypes of the ER + cells defined by immunofluorescence utilizing monoclonal antibodies (MAb). In 11 of 18 CLL patients (CLL group I) there was excellent correlation between ER + and T3 (mature T cell marker) positivity. In the remaining patients (CLL group II), only 5-45% of ER + cells were T3 positive, suggesting that many rosetting cells were non-T. However, the ER +, T3 negative cells were nonreactive with OKM -1 (MAb which detects monocytes and 'null' lymphocytes) or with OKT11, 9.6, and 35.1, MAb against the T cell E receptor. Moreover ER +, T3 negative cells were not stained with OKT4, OKT8, OKT6, OKT9 , or OKT10 . Treatment of group II ER + cells with neuraminidase increased (from 27% to 74%) the mean percentages of T3 positive cells detected, but not other membrane antigens. ER + cells from group II patients, compared with normal and group I patients, exhibited diminished proliferative responses to PHA and Con-A (P less than 0.01) and supported poorly pokeweed mitogen-induced proliferation of normal allogeneic B cells (P less than 0.01). Thus, in approximately one-third of the CLL patients studied, many ER + cells poorly express a number of membrane antigens characteristic of normal mature T cells, one of which (T3) is unmasked by neuraminidase treatment. This phenotypic abnormality appears to be associated with significant T cell dysfunction in vitro and may, at least in part, contribute to the commonly encountered immunological defects present in these patients.","['Kay, N E', 'Kaplan, M E']","['Kay NE', 'Kaplan ME']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1984.tb02870.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1984 May;57(1):105-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1984.tb02870.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Mitogens)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",,,,

Clonal variation in the susceptibility to specific T cell-mediated cytotoxicity (TC), which is inversely related to tumorigenicity in syngeneic animals, was demonstrated among clones derived from a cultured line of DBA/2 lymphoma L1210 by limiting dilution. Thus, although a majority of such clones were TC-resistant and highly tumorigenic, some clones were TC-susceptible and non-tumorigenic. Moreover, an inoculation of the variant clones bearing the latter phenotype was shown to elicit protective immunity in host mice against a challenge with the parent L1210, whereas an inoculation of spleen cells (or extracts) from hosts bearing tumorigenic clones would abrogate the priming effects of the non-tumorigenic variants, presumably through splenic suppressor cells.

It specifically agglutinates mouse red cells. Material with hemagglutinating activity partitioned into the lipid-soluble phase of a Folch partition of the trypsin extract was sensitive to phospholipase C and alkali, and on two-dimensional thin layer chromatography, it co-migrated principally with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Phosphatidylcholine, the major lipid present, was inactive. The relationship of phospholipid structure to hemagglutinating activity has been described. PE in the crude trypsin extract was associated with unidentified glycoprotein and albumin. Material containing hemagglutinating lipid bound to a wheat germ lectin-Sepharose column and was released by N-acetylglucosamine, indicating that the PE was complexed with glycoprotein. When the crude trypsin extract or eluate from the lectin column was extracted with aqueous phenol, hemagglutinin in the aqueous phase no longer bound to wheat germ lectin-Sepharose; however, albumin was greatly enriched, indicating that some of the PE exists in a complex with albumin. The molar ratio of PE to albumin was approximately 200:1. After delipidation, this albumin (in molar excess) inhibited hemagglutination by PE in the same way as a recently described subclass of serum albumin. Studies with phospholipase-treated B cells were also consistent with PE being the MER. We conclude that MER is PE, existing in a complex containing glycoprotein and a subclass of albumin. The capacity to form rosettes can be transferred to nonrosetting Raji B cells by the complex, but not pure PE, indicating that the proteins may be involved in orienting PE correctly for it to function as the MER.","['Zalewski, P D', 'Valente, L', 'Forbes, I J']","['Zalewski PD', 'Valente L', 'Forbes IJ']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Hemagglutination/drug effects', 'Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests', 'Hemagglutinins/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lectins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/isolation & purification/*physiology', '*Rosette Formation', 'Type C Phospholipases/pharmacology', 'Wheat Germ Agglutinins']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 May;132(5):2491-5.,"['0 (Hemagglutinins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Wheat Germ Agglutinins)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)']",,,,

The in vivo growth of adoptively transferred T lymphocytes that had been previously cultured long-term with IL 2 was initially examined, because in vitro such T cells are exquisitely dependent upon exogenous IL 2 for proliferation and survival. Daily administration of IL 2 in vivo, beginning on the day of cell transfer, induced these IL 2-dependent long-term cultured T lymphocytes to proliferate in vivo, and the magnitude of in vivo growth was proportional to the dose of IL 2 administered. The capacity of IL 2 to induce the in vivo growth of antigen-activated T cells not previously exposed in vitro to exogenous IL 2 was similarly studied. T lymphocytes from the spleens of immune mice, activated by 5-day culture with tumor antigen before transfer, survived poorly in vivo when injected with antigen alone, but demonstrated marked proliferation in vivo in response to antigen and exogenous IL 2. By contrast, immune spleen cells transferred with antigen, but without prior culture, proliferated without supplementary exogenous IL 2. Moreover, the growth of noncultured donor T cells was not augmented by the administration of exogenous IL 2, implying that noncultured spleen cells immune to tumor antigens can produce sufficient amounts of endogenous IL 2 in vivo to sustain maximal T cell growth over the time period examined. Importantly, the ability of exogenous IL 2 to induce donor T cell growth in vivo correlated with its ability to function in vivo to augment the anti-tumor efficacy of specifically immune donor T cells in models for the adoptive therapy of disseminated antigenic murine leukemia. Thus, the current studies highlight the potential of exogenous IL 2 to induce T cell growth in vivo and suggest that the administration of IL 2 in vivo may be useful for augmenting T cell responses that are relatively deficient in the production of endogenous IL 2.","['Cheever, M A', 'Greenberg, P D', 'Irle, C', 'Thompson, J A', 'Urdal, D L', 'Mochizuki, D Y', 'Henney, C S', 'Gillis, S']","['Cheever MA', 'Greenberg PD', 'Irle C', 'Thompson JA', 'Urdal DL', 'Mochizuki DY', 'Henney CS', 'Gillis S']",['eng'],"['CA 00721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage/physiology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/transplantation', 'Time Factors']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 May;132(5):2259-65.,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],,,,

Because Con A bound to Sepharose beads (Con A-Seph) is also effective, it has been concluded by Z. K. Ballas, W. R. Green, and C. S. Henney. (Cell. Immunol. 59, 411, 1981) that Con A-mediated ""activation"" of the cytolytic cell to kill in LDCC can occur without intracellular penetration of the lectin. No preincubation of either effector or target cells with Con A-Seph has been performed. Exploiting the previous finding of G. Berke (Immunol. Rev. 72, 5, 1983) that in LDCC Con A exerts its effect(s) strictly by affecting the target rather than by bridging effector and target cells and activating the effector, identical results with Con A-Seph are shown. Preincubation of Con A-Seph with the target but not with the effector cells results in substantial killing. Moreover it is shown that the ability of Con A-Seph to mediate LDCC can be attributed to free Con A dissociating from the beads (about 1%) during the assay. Evidence is presented to indicate that the dissociated Con A, not unlike free Con A, reacts with the target cells, thereby rendering them recognizable by the effector cells. It is concluded that the activity of Con A-Seph may not be taken as evidence for Con A-mediated activation of the cytolytic cell, as suggested by Ballas et al., and that the putative Con A-mediated lymphocyte activation relevant to killing still remains to be demonstrated. Evidence contradicting Con A-mediated activation of the effector and supporting the target cell modification theory has been discussed by G. Berke, V. Hu, E. McVey, and W. R. Clark (J.

This paper describes the generation of a family of growth-factor-independent aneuploid or pseudodiploid TCL cells after the injection into the thymus of growth-factor-dependent diploid TCLB cells. In contrast to the donor TCLB cells, the resulting TCL cells could be cloned in semisolid medium, produced local tumors at the site of subcutaneous injection, and proliferated in a growth-factor-independent fashion in vitro. The induced growth-factor-independent TCL cells were chromosomally and phenotypically unstable and continued to evolve both in vivo and in vitro.

This antibody identified a unique fetal antigen, which is expressed exclusively on embryonic thymocytes of all strains tested. Therefore, the antigen defined was named fetal thymus antigen-1, FT-1. The proportion of FT-1+ fetal thymocytes detected by immunofluorescence assay sharply decreases as gestation time increases, and finally they disappear from the thymus. On the other hand, Thy-1+ cells increase in inverse proportion. The immunofluorescence studies and absorption tests showed that FT-1 antigen is not detectable on brain, liver, kidney, or lymphoid tissue cells of adult mice. However, it is expressed on some leukemia cells of various mouse strains, which demonstrated that this is the first example of an oncofetal antigen of a mouse leukemia. The molecular weight of FT-1 antigen on leukemia cells was estimated to be 130,000 by means of biosynthetic labeling with [3H]galactose and [35S]methionine. The two-dimensional gel electrophoresis pattern of FT-1 antigen shows a family of glycoproteins with extensive charge heterogeneity.

The procedures for initiating and maintaining the bone marrow cultures are described in detail as are the phases of growth through which the cultures should progress. Also included are methods for preparing and manipulating low cell-density feeder layers, on which B cell populations can be expanded, and a method for obtaining pre-B and B cell clonal lines. The lymphoid cells which are obtained from these cultures early after establishment (3-8 weeks) are predominantly pre-B cells which can serve as targets for transformation by Abelson murine leukemia virus.

Two human leukemic cell lines, HL60 (promyelocytic) and U937 (monocytic), that do not routinely produce CSA were studied. Induction of differentiation toward macrophages was followed by acquisition of new cell-surface antigenic determinants characteristic of normal monocyte-macrophages (Mo); this change was accompanied by CSA production. With two monoclonal antihuman-monocyte antibodies (OKM1 and 63D3) it was shown that unstimulated HL60 cells did not express these antigens, but 56% of the HL60-derived macrophages were positive for OKM1 and 51% for 63D3 antibody. Expression of the OKM1 antigen increased from 25% in the unstimulated U937 cells to 47% in the stimulated U937-derived macrophages.

Specific cytotoxic effects of the conjugates.,63-71,"A method is described for preparing specific cytotoxic agents by linking intact ricin to antibodies in a manner that produces obstruction of the galactose-binding sites on the B chain of the toxin and so diminishes the capacity of the conjugate to bind non-specifically to cells. The conjugates were synthesised by reacting iodoacetylated ricin with thiolated immunoglobulin and the components of conjugate with reduced galactose-binding capacity were separated by affinity chromatography on Sepharose (a beta-galactosyl matrix) and asialofetuin-Sepharose. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analyses revealed that the fraction of a monoclonal anti-Thy1.1-ricin conjugate that passed through a Sepharose column had markedly diminished capacity to bind non-specifically to Thy1.2-expressing CBA thymocytes and EL4 lymphoma cells. The fraction of conjugate that passed through an asialofetuin-Sepharose column displayed no detectable non-specific binding. Both fractions of conjugate were potent cytotoxic agents for Thy1.1-expressing AKR-A lymphoma cells in tissue culture. They reduced the [3H]leucine incorporation of the cells by 50% at a concentration of 2-5 pM. Comparable inhibition of EL4 cells was only achieved with 3000-7500-fold greater concentrations of conjugate. By contrast, the fraction of anti-Thy1.1-ricin that retained Sepharose-binding capacity showed marked non-specific binding and toxicity to EL4 cells. A conjugate with diminished galactose-binding capacity was also prepared from the W3/25 monoclonal antibody which recognises an antigen upon helper T-lymphocytes in the rat. It elicited powerful and specific toxic effects upon W3/25 antigen-expressing rat T-leukaemia cells. This finding is of particular importance because isolated ricin A-chain disulphide-linked to W3/25 antibody is not cytotoxic. The property of the B-chain in intact ricin conjugates that facilitates delivery of the A-chain to the cytosol thus appears to be independent of galactose recognition. It is concluded that the 'blocked' ricin conjugates combine the advantages of high potency, which is often lacking in antibody-A-chain conjugates, with high specificity, which previously was lacking in intact ricin conjugates.","['Thorpe, P E', 'Ross, W C', 'Brown, A N', 'Myers, C D', 'Cumber, A J', 'Foxwell, B M', 'Forrester, J T']","['Thorpe PE', 'Ross WC', 'Brown AN', 'Myers CD', 'Cumber AJ', 'Foxwell BM', 'Forrester JT']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Galactose/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Ricin/immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1984/04/02 00:00,1984/04/02 00:01,['1984/04/02 00:00'],"['1984/04/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/02 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1984.tb08067.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1984 Apr 2;140(1):63-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1984.tb08067.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",,,,

In addition, elimination of T-cells by treatment with anti-Thy 1.2 antibodies plus complement had no effect on the ability of spleen cells from serum-protected mice to adoptively transfer antiviral resistance. We now show that similar depletion of B-cells with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G plus complement or macrophages by adherence to Sephadex G-10 columns also leaves intact the protective capacity of spleen cells from serum-protected mice. That these results reflect the ability of more than one spleen cell population to transfer antiviral resistance rather than the activity of a non-T, non-B, nonmacrophage cell compartment is supported by the finding that purified splenic T- or B-cells alone from serum-protected DBA/2 mice can adoptively transfer antiviral resistance. Given the previously reported effects of sublethal irradiation on FLV leukemogenesis which could potentially complicate the interpretation of adoptive transfer experiments carried out in this system, analogous studies were performed using a Winn-type assay in which putative effector cells were preincubated with virus before inoculation of the mixture in unirradiated mice. These Winn assay experiments yielded identical results in that serum-protected spleen cells again prevented viral leukemogenesis, and the separate elimination of T-cells, B-cells, or macrophages had no effect on their protective activity. In addition, mixed transfer of serum-protected and normal spleen cells also protected irradiated mice against FLV challenge, providing further evidence that this adoptive protection truly reflects the presence of virus-specific effector cells in the spleens of serum-protected mice and not an inability of these spleen cells to replace radiation-sensitive viral target cells in recipient animals, since these should be supplied by the normal spleen cells in the transferred mixture.","['Genovesi, E V', 'Pettey, C L', 'Collins, J J']","['Genovesi EV', 'Pettey CL', 'Collins JJ']",['eng'],"['5T32-CA-09111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA 25863/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Immune Sera', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology']",1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Apr;44(4):1489-98.,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,

Mice given injections i.p. or i.v. with pure Jurkat IL-2, at doses comparable on a microgram/kg basis to contemplated doses for humans, showed no signs of toxicity on the basis of serial measurements of weight, serum liver and kidney chemistries, or histology of lymphoid and vital organs. Jurkat IL-2 had no effect on the rate of growth or survival of mice with an established s.c. methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma, but Jurkat IL-2 used in conjunction with in vitro-resensitized and IL-2-expanded specific immune splenocytes prolonged survival of mice with disseminated FBL-3 tumor. This survival prolongation was highly significant when compared to treatment with Jurkat IL-2 alone (p = less than 0.001) or an equivalent number of in vitro-resensitized and expanded cells alone (p = 0.004). Treatment of mice with i.p. Jurkat IL-2 subsequent to secondary immunization with allogeneic tumor enhanced by more than 5-fold the splenocyte cytotoxicity for alloantigen measured 7 days later. Thus, purified human IL-2 derived from the Jurkat cell line has a short half-life in mice with no apparent toxicity at large doses.

In addition, data are needed to define the epidemiology of this agent in adult malignancies to assess the validity of the methodology employed in antigen detection, and to elucidate the value of these methods in the diagnosis, prophylaxis, and prognosis of P carinii infection in adults with cancer. The study was designed to determine the incidence of P carinii antigenemia in ambulatory patients with solid tumors or hematologic malignancies. The authors also sought to determine if antigenemia as detected by a counterimmunoelectrophoresis test correlated with any clinical parameter. Patients included in the study were ambulatory, asymptomatic, afebrile, adult cancer patients seen in the clinic for follow-up or treatment. Coded sera were electrophoresed against high-titered rabbit antiserum to P carinii organisms. Two hundred forty-seven patients were studied, including 172 hematologic malignancies (average age, 57 years), 109 men and 63 women; 75 solid tumors (average age, 55 years), 39 women and 36 men. One hundred three healthy adults served as controls. Only five patients had positive antigen (2%). All of these patients had hematologic malignancies and were women. None of the control sera were antigen-positive. We conclude that the incidence of P carinii antigenemia in asymptomatic adults with neoplastic disease is extremely low. A positive P carinii antigen in the absence of clinical symptoms most likely represents subclinical infection. Positive antigen does not always indicate active disease, but probably reflects mobilization of antigen during generalized inflammatory response or possible pulmonary insult.

Their study has recently been facilitated by the classification proposed by the French-American-British (FAB) Cooperative Group. Using this scheme it is now possible to define more precisely their natural history and clinical relationship to acute leukaemia. Using the longitudinal case control technique, we reviewed the clinical data and morphology of 69 patients (all elderly males) with chronic irreversible haematological cytopenia and dysplasia. Applying FAB criteria we found: refractory anaemia (RA) in 43%; sideroblastic anaemia (RA-S) in 33%; refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB) in 13%; RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T) in 9% and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) in 1%. The median survival for the entire group was 27 months (RA, 52; RA-S, 29; RAEB, 12; RAEB-T 11; and CMML, 2 months). Short survival was predicted by transfusion requirement and other manifestations of severe cytopenia, as well as by myeloid immaturity. The presence or absence of sideroblastosis did not correlate with survival. Acute leukaemia developed in only eight patients (12%), six of whom initially had RA. Leukaemic transformation was not predicted by progressive cytological immaturity. This study demonstrates that even in the absence of leukaemic transformation, chronic myelodysplasia is a lethal haematological disorder.","['Weisdorf, D J', 'Oken, M M', 'Johnson, G J', 'Rydell, R E']","['Weisdorf DJ', 'Oken MM', 'Johnson GJ', 'Rydell RE']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/complications', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*complications/mortality/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Preleukemia/pathology', 'Syndrome']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1983.tb02852.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1983 Dec;55(4):691-700. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1983.tb02852.x.,,,,,

In the absence of profound myelosuppression or detectable hemorrhage, drug-induced erythrocytotoxicity was suspected, prompting in vitro studies of erythrocytes from children with acute leukemia and normal adults. At therapeutic concentration, Ara-C and TG, individually and in combination, produced significant stomatocytosis in samples from both groups. Since phenothiazines are stomatocytogenic and are administered as anti-emetics in conjunction with cancer chemotherapy, chlorpromazine was investigated in parallel studies that demonstrated stomatocytosis at therapeutic concentration, but no consistent interaction with the effects of Ara-C and TG in this regard.

Mathieu-Mahul, J. M. Heard, S. Fichelson, S. Gisselbrecht, B. Sola, and C. J. Larsen (1982) virology 119, 59-67). In the present work, characterization of this gp66 was continued. First, immunoprecipitation tests, using cytoplasmic membrane subfractions from one of the myelomonocytic cell lines in which gp66 was first detected, indicated that most of it was associated with rough endoplasmic reticulum. Second, to define the limits of gp66 expression, a variety of hemopoietic cell lines were analyzed for gp66 content. These lines were obtained (a) from various tumors (including erythroleukemias, chloroleukemias, and lymphatic leukemias) induced in susceptible mice by F-MuLV and (b) from long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC) infected with F-MuLV. In the latter case, lines of adherent fibroblastoid cells and nonadherent cells with myelomonocytic and mastocytic characteristics were obtained. Although several F-MuLV isolates were used, gp66 was only expressed in myelomonocytic and mastocytic cells. This did not result from in vitro culture conditions as gp66 was also found in fresh cells. These data suggested that a particular processing of the env gene product may exist in both myelomonocytic and mastocytic cell lines. In agreement with this hypothesis, a metabolically unstable gp62 related to MCF gp70 was found in one myelomonocytic cell line expressing MCF virus.","['Mathieu-Mahul, D', 'Heard, J M', 'Fichelson, S', 'Mauchauffe, M', 'Larsen, C J']","['Mathieu-Mahul D', 'Heard JM', 'Fichelson S', 'Mauchauffe M', 'Larsen CJ']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*microbiology', 'Mast Cells', 'Mice', 'Viral Proteins/*biosynthesis']",1984/01/30 00:00,1984/01/30 00:01,['1984/01/30 00:00'],"['1984/01/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/30 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(84)90036-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1984 Jan 30;132(2):292-302. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(84)90036-9.,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],,,,

The mutants all contained deletions of the NarI site in the P12 region, and some contained deletions extending into the adjacent P15 region. The deletions did not significantly affect the assembly or release of viral particles. Examination of endogenous reverse transcription products demonstrated normal synthesis of minus- and plus-strand strong-stop DNAs, indicating that the RNA genome was packaged and that reverse transcription in detergent-permeabilized virions was not impaired. The virion particles contained high levels of an abnormal protein which corresponded to a P15-P12 fusion protein; proteolytic processing of this abnormal protein was completely blocked by all the mutations. The infectivity of the particles was dramatically reduced. Analysis of the low-molecular-weight DNA in infected NIH/3T3 cells indicated that the mutant virions could not carry out viral DNA synthesis.

To determine their capacity for further differentiation we stimulated cells from a series of 10 cases of CLL with a phorbol ester and assayed for production of immunoglobulin protein, accumulation of immunoglobulin mRNA, and alterations in cell surface markers. We found that cells from all cases were induced to secret monoclonal immunoglobulin of the same heavy and light chain type as the surface membrane immunoglobulin type. Immunoglobulin secretion was preceded by a rapid increase in the levels of mRNA coding for IgM, predominantly the secretory form, mu s-mRNA, rather than the membrane form, mu m-mRNA. A similar selection of mu s- over mu m-mRNA is known to occur in plasma cells by a mechanism of differential processing of mRNA from a single mu-chain gene. Except for a decline in the expression of surface IgD, cell surface determinants remained unaffected both in terms of the percentage of positive cells and the relative number of sites per cell. In contrast to previous studies, these results indicate that CLL cells consistently retain the capacity to further differentiate toward plasma cells and secrete immunoglobulin. The immunoglobulin secretion is mediated, at least in part, by a developmentally regulated increment in mu s-mRNA.","['Cossman, J', 'Neckers, L M', 'Braziel, R M', 'Trepel, J B', 'Korsmeyer, S J', 'Bakhshi, A']","['Cossman J', 'Neckers LM', 'Braziel RM', 'Trepel JB', 'Korsmeyer SJ', 'Bakhshi A']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1984/02/01 00:00,1984/02/01 00:01,['1984/02/01 00:00'],"['1984/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI111247 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1984 Feb;73(2):587-92. doi: 10.1172/JCI111247.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",PMC425052,,,

This was done by measuring the level of an active metabolite of 6MP, 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6TGN), and comparing it both with the drug dose and with subsequent neutropenia in the presence or absence of concurrent cotrimoxazole. In children who were not taken cotrimoxazole, the concentration of 6TGN showed a significant positive correlation with the dose and a significant negative correlation with the absolute neutrophil count 2 weeks later. In those who were taking the antibiotic both these relationships were lost. This suggests that cotrimoxazole can interfere with both the absorption and the cytotoxicity of 6MP and may, in turn, alter its antileukaemic effect.","['Rees, C A', 'Lennard, L', 'Lilleyman, J S', 'Maddocks, J L']","['Rees CA', 'Lennard L', 'Lilleyman JS', 'Maddocks JL']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Absorption', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Combinations/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Guanine Nucleotides/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Sulfamethoxazole/*pharmacology', 'Thionucleotides/blood', 'Trimethoprim/*pharmacology', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00254595 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1984;12(2):87-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00254595.,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '15867-02-4 (6-thioguanylic acid)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', 'AN164J8Y0X (Trimethoprim)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'JE42381TNV (Sulfamethoxazole)']",,,,

There is also evidence that the T cell is an important source of burst promoting activity (BPA) for the peripheral blood (PB) erythroid burst forming unit (BFU-e). We studied the BPA of T cells and response of BFU-e in normals and untreated early stage B cell CLL patients in a methylcellulose colony assay. Normal null cell cultures grew significantly more BFU-e than CLL null cell cultures. Addition of autologous T cells to normal or CLL null cells significantly increased BFU-e only in normals. Allogeneic coculture of T cells from CLL patients with null cells from normals yielded normal responses of BFU-e in five of six cases. In contrast, allogeneic coculture of normal T cells with CLL null cells yielded a normal response in only one of six studies. Furthermore, adding increasing quantities of autologous or normal allogeneic T cells to CLL null cells did not augment the BFU-e response. Accounting for the expanded lymphocyte pool in CLL, BFU-e are decreased in concentration but the absolute number is normal or increased. The decrease in concentration could be secondary to expansion of the null cell fraction in CLL by pre-B cells. CLL T cells appeared to augment normal allogeneic PB BFU-e in a normal fashion, whereas, in several cases, CLL BFU-e were hyporesponsive to autologous or normal allogeneic T cells. It is therefore apparent that in untreated early stage B cell CLL, erythroid progenitor cells are present in the peripheral blood but are diluted in an expanded null cell compartment and may, in some cases, be hyporesponsive to T cell BPA.

The Leu-3a+/2a+ ratio was applied to define the balance between the helper/suppressor subsets in the residual T-lymphocytes.

There was no correlation between the proportion of EAC or MRBC rosetting cells and stages of B-CLL.

These postulates were explored in a patient with T-CLL receiving dCF with a resultant fall in peripheral blood lymphocytes from 740 X 10(9)/1 to 90 X 10(9)/1 over 15 d. In red cells there was complete inhibition of adenosine deaminase and SAH hydrolase activities, progressive deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) accumulation and ATP depletion but no significant alteration in adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase activity or distribution in purine intermediates from radioactive adenosine. In T-CLL lymphocytes, there was incomplete lymphoid SAH hydrolase inactivation, reduced AMP deaminase activity and progressive dATP accumulation. The limited decrease in lymphocyte ATP content was related more to dCF administration than dATP accumulation, nor accompanied by significant changes in the distribution of purine intermediates from adenosine. These findings suggest that ATP depletion with dCF therapy does not reflect AMP deaminase activity modulation nor is of critical importance for cell toxicity. The exact role for elevated cellular dATP content and SAH hydrolase inactivation in this toxicity remains to be established.","['Hallam, L J', 'Van der Weyden, M B', 'Ackland, S P', 'Bagnara, A S', 'Whiteside, M G']","['Hallam LJ', 'Van der Weyden MB', 'Ackland SP', 'Bagnara AS', 'Whiteside MG']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,IM,"['AMP Deaminase/blood', 'Adenosine Deaminase/blood', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/blood', 'Adenosylhomocysteinase', 'Coformycin/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/blood', 'Deoxyadenosines/blood', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin', 'Ribonucleosides/*administration & dosage', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/*immunology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1984.tb00678.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1984 Jan;32(1):55-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1984.tb00678.x.,"['0 (Deoxyadenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.3.1.1 (Adenosylhomocysteinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.6 (AMP Deaminase)', ""K8KCC8SH6N (2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate)""]",,,,

Their flanking cellular fragments were subcloned into pBR322 and used as a probe to screen other thymoma DNAs. With one clone (pMo-lC) used as a probe, we could detect novel fragments in 11 out of 20 thymoma DNAs analyzed.

We examined the in vivo effects of a potent inhibitor of ADA, 2'-deoxycoformycin, which was used to treat a patient with refractory acute leukemia. Unexpectedly, within 7 days of starting treatment, the leukemic phenotype underwent complete conversion from T lymphoblastic to promyelocytic, with kinetics that suggested a precursor-product relationship between the two cell populations. Pretreatment T lymphoblasts and posttreatment promyelocytes had the same abnormal karyotype. Upon culture in vitro, the former transformed spontaneously over several weeks into mature myeloid cells. We conclude that the leukemia arose from a multipotent stem cell capable of both lymphoid and myeloid differentiation. Effects of ADA inhibition on leukemia cells during treatment included expansion of the deoxyadenosine nucleotide pool and accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine, a potent inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation. The influence of these changes on the leukemic phenotype is discussed in terms of (i) selective cytotoxicity to T lymphoblasts, which accumulated deoxyadenosine nucleotides more efficiently than did the patient's promyelocytes during in vitro incubation with deoxycoformycin plus deoxyadenosine, and (ii) induction of an altered program of differentiation.","['Hershfield, M S', 'Kurtzberg, J', 'Harden, E', 'Moore, J O', 'Whang-Peng, J', 'Haynes, B F']","['Hershfield MS', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Harden E', 'Moore JO', 'Whang-Peng J', 'Haynes BF']",['eng'],"['AM 00434/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 20902/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Coformycin/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pentostatin', 'Phenotype', 'Ribonucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.81.1.253 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Jan;81(1):253-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.81.1.253.,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)']",PMC344650,,,

This effect by mercury was observed in spite of the decrease in growth rate and DNA contents of the cells. Thymidine kinase activity in Molt-4F cells treated with 2 X 10(-5)M mercury decreased to 50 to 60% of the control activity. The stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation into the cells by mercury, therefore, might be independent of the increase in thymidine kinase activity. 3H-Thymidine incorporation by the control cells decreased as culture time passed. In contrast to the control, [3H]thymidine incorporation by mercury-treated cells increased until 72-hr culture. [3H]Thymidine uptake by the control cells after 24, 48, or 72-hr culture increased until 20 min of incubation period, but thereafter no increase in the uptake was observed until 60 min. On the other hand, [3H]thymidine uptake by the cells treated with mercury for 24 to 72 hr increased linearly until 60 min of incubation period. These results seemed to indicate that the mercury stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation might be attributable not to the actual increase of DNA synthesis but to the suppression of the culture time-dependent decrease in the incorporation by the control cells.","['Ochi, T', 'Takahashi, K', 'Ohsawa, M']","['Ochi T', 'Takahashi K', 'Ohsawa M']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Exp Med,The Japanese journal of experimental medicine,9800765,IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mercury/*pharmacology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Thymidine/*metabolism', 'Thymidine Kinase/analysis', 'Tritium']",1983/08/01 00:00,1983/08/01 00:01,['1983/08/01 00:00'],"['1983/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Exp Med. 1983 Aug;53(4):187-94.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'FXS1BY2PGL (Mercury)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,

Patients received a total of six i.m. doses at weekly intervals as follows: 1, 3, 10, 30, 60, and 100 x 10(6) IU. Patients were monitored at each dose level for serum IFN activity, anti-IFN antibodies, immunomodulation, clinical toxicity, and response. All patients exhibited clinical toxicity, including fever, chills, fatigue, headache, anorexia, mild-to-moderate leukopenia, nausea, and vomiting. Toxicity was dose-related, with significant side effects occurring in all patients at levels of 10 x 10(6) IU and above and some evidence of tachyphylaxis at higher doses. All side effects, including leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, were of short duration and were resolved within 3-5 days. Fevers, rigors, myalgias, and fatigue were partially alleviated by premedication with acetaminophen or hydrocortisone. Pharmacokinetic data indicated mean peak serum IFN titers greater than 90 at a dose of 10 x 10(6) IU and greater than or equal to 200 at doses greater than or equal to 30 x 10(6) IU 8 h after injection. No anti-IFN antibodies were detected. However, the serum levels achieved at higher doses were not linear, possibly indicating in vivo degradation. Total T cells, B cells, monocytes, and T subsets monitored by flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies remained essentially constant throughout the trial. Although some patients demonstrated minor augmentations of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and natural killing (NK) activity at the lowest IFN-alpha 2 doses, the majority of patients demonstrated decreases in NK activity after higher IFN doses. No correlation between immunomodulation and clinical response to IFN was observed. At higher dose levels, the predominant immunomodulatory effect of IFN-alpha 2 was suppression of NK, ADCC, and blastogenic responses to T-cell mitogens and recall antigens. B-cell functional deficits as well as radioresistant T-helper and radiosensitive T-suppressor function assessed in a pokeweed mitogen-driven immunoglobulin secretion assay appeared unaffected by IFN administration. One myeloma patient showed progression and was discontinued after 60 x 10(6) IU. There were four patients (3 NHL, 1 myeloma) who achieved partial remission (greater than or equal to 50% tumor reduction) and three (1 CLL, 2 NHL) who showed objective tumor responses of less than 50%. These data suggest that rDNA IFN-alpha 2 is well-tolerated and may have significant antitumor activity against lymphoproliferative malignancies.

Sequential immunoprecipitation test, with the partially purified 125I-B/Dak preparation using four different rat alloantisera, including a monoclonal antibody, disclosed three distinctive populations of beta units of the class II molecules. Highly purified beta units of three discriminable class II molecules were shown to have different structural properties in terms of molecular weights and of electrophoretic profiles on the isoelectric focusing. The beta units shifted to a position of higher molecular weight on SDS-PAGE under reducing condition, thus suggesting to carry intradisulfide bonds. Furthermore, the highly purified beta units cross-reacted with murine anti-Ia sera. The rebinding test revealed that at least two discriminable species of beta units cross-react with anti-I-Ak monoclonal antibody, whereas beta units purified by binding with the 1E4 monoclonal antibody cross-reacted with anti-I-Ab and/or anti-I-Ad antiserum.

Using a radioimmuno-binding or -precipitation assay, V- mice showed good antibody production after challenge with Moloney-murine sarcoma virus (M-MSV), but no antibodies were detected in V+ mice. Moreover, Mov-13 V+ mice failed to generate virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in secondary mixed-leukocyte tumor cell culture (MLTC) while V- mice showed a strong cytotoxic response. This lack of activity in mass V+ cultures was due to a very low frequency of CTL precursors which did not increase following in vivo challenge with M-MSV or in vitro stimulation with MBL-2 Moloney leukemia cell line. These findings indicate that early M-MuLV activation in Mov-13 V+ mice induces a state of tolerance to viral antigens involving both the humoral and cellular immune responses and related to the high incidence of T-cell lymphomas.","['Ronchese, F', ""D'Andrea, E"", 'Collavo, D', 'De Rossi, A', 'Zanovello, P', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L']","['Ronchese F', ""D'Andrea E"", 'Collavo D', 'De Rossi A', 'Zanovello P', 'Chieco-Bianchi L']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain', 'Crosses, Genetic', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1984/02/01 00:00,1984/02/01 00:01,['1984/02/01 00:00'],"['1984/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(84)90317-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(84)90317-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1984 Feb;83(2):379-88. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(84)90317-4.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Col1a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain)']",,,,

Monoclonal antibody inhibition of the allogeneically primed cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) reaction indicated that the T cells (BALB/c anti-EL4; H-2d anti-H-2b) were specific only for the H-2Kb target cell antigen. These WD1 variant cells were used as targets in the CMC assay using anti-H-2Kb T cells and compared with the parent EL4 in vitro line.

Since there is considerable variation among DBA/2 mice in the course of the L5178Y tumor-dormant state, analysis of these phenotypic changes required prospective studies on individual mice. Therefore, we developed a partial peritoneal lavage technique which could be performed repeatedly on an individual mouse without killing the mouse and without terminating the tumor-dormant state. The partial peritoneal lavage technique provided cell samples that were quantitatively representative of the entire peritoneal cell contents without altering the relative proportions or total number of host peritoneal cell subpopulations. Tumor cell clones were isolated from the uncloned L5178Y cell inoculum that was used to initiate the tumor-dormant state, and from the partial peritoneal lavage performed on individual mice at regular intervals throughout the tumor-dormant state until each mouse developed an ascitic tumor. We found that the uncloned L5178Y cell population is heterogeneous, with the majority of the cells [approximately 80% of the clonal populations (""original"" phenotype)] able to compete as well as the uncloned L5178Y cell population for immune cytolytic T-lymphocyte activity, and a smaller percentage [approximately 20% of the clones (""emergent"" phenotype)] competing significantly less but similar to the tumor cell population which grows out as an ascitic tumor at the termination of the tumor-dormant state. However, both ""original"" and ""emergent"" phenotypes encompass a range of subpopulations which have the respective characteristics. There was a progressive enrichment in the tumor cell population for ""emergent""-phenotype cells as mice progressed through the tumor-dormant state. In the 30-day period prior to tumor emergence, only ""emergent""-phenotype cell clones were isolated. These data indicate that, during the course of the tumor-dormant state, there is continual selection by immune cytolytic T-lymphocytes for ""emergent""-phenotype cells, which preexist in the L5178Y cell population used to initiate the tumor-dormant state, and that the progressive enrichment of ""emergent""-phenotype cells in the peritoneal cavity is associated with and may be responsible for termination of the tumor-dormant state.","['Trainer, D L', 'Wheelock, E F']","['Trainer DL', 'Wheelock EF']",['eng'],['CA 32577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Leukemia L5178/genetics/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Mar;44(3):1063-71.,,,,,

Preincubation with LPS at 20 micrograms/ml for 30 min at 37 degrees increased the binding of all nonadherent (NA) lymphocyte populations to K562 tumors [unseparated NA lymphocytes from 13.1 to 25.1%, immunoglobulin G Fc receptor-enriched lymphocytes from 27.6 to 42.9%, and immunoglobulin G Fc receptor-depleted lymphocytes from 14.0 to 23.7%, at p less than 0.001]. In contrast, interferon (IFN) at 10 units/ml had no effect on the overall binding of lymphocytes to K562 tumors. When lymphocyte-tumor conjugates were dispersed in agarose, cytotoxic activity of unseparated NA lymphocytes at 1 to 3 hr was markedly increased by preincubation with LPS (p less than 0.001). However, LPS did not enhance cytotoxicity if conjugates were formed in its absence. IFN, likewise, increased cytotoxic activity in unseparated NA lymphocytes at 1 to 3 hr (p less than 0.001). No synergistic cytotoxicity was seen with concurrent exposure to LPS and IFN. LPS increased cytotoxicity in the Fc receptor-enriched:tumor conjugates at 1 to 3 hr (p less than 0.001) and appeared to promote more efficient killing in individual conjugates over time. Cytotoxicity in the Fc receptor-depleted:tumor conjugates was not enhanced by LPS. Thus, LPS may enhance natural killer cell-like activity by increasing the binding of human lymphocytes to K562 tumors and by rearranging the population of binding cells to include more efficient killer cells. While the effects of LPS on binding appear independent of IFN, selective recruitment of more efficient killer cells could be through an IFN mechanism.","['Salata, R A', 'Kleinhenz, M E', 'Schacter, B Z', 'Ellner, J J']","['Salata RA', 'Kleinhenz ME', 'Schacter BZ', 'Ellner JJ']",['eng'],['AI-18471/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Mar;44(3):1044-7.,['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)'],,,,

We thus examined lymphocytes depleted of monocytes and B cells, from 6 CLL patients and 6 normal individuals, that were identified on the basis of binding to K562, expressing OKM1, or expressing receptors for the Fc portion of IgG. In the CLL patients studied, lymphocytes that bind to K562 cells, as well as OKM1+ cells isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting, were morphologically similar to LGL of normal individuals, with the exception that more than 75% of the patients' cells were deficient in azurophilic cytoplasmic granules, which typify normal individuals' LGL. Furthermore, although the percentages of the patients' FcR+ cells reactive with OKT11A, 9.6 and OKM1 were very similar to those of normals, the majority of the patients' FcR+ cells were deficient in azurophilic granules and lacked NK activity. These findings indicate that the impaired NK activity in CLL patients is associated with cells that are phenotypically and morphologically NK cells, but which lack azurophilic granules that are thought to play a role in NK-mediated lysis.","['Kay, N E', 'Zarling, J M']","['Kay NE', 'Zarling JM']",['eng'],['R01 CA 26738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Separation', '*Cytoplasmic Granules', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Monocytes', 'Receptors, Fc']",1984/02/01 00:00,1984/02/01 00:01,['1984/02/01 00:00'],"['1984/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85405-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Feb;63(2):305-9.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",,,,

In all but four cases the secretion of IgM was either induced or increased, often to a high level. In contrast, the export of free immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains, an almost consistent feature of the B lymphocytic leukemias, remained relatively constant after TPA treatment. Parallel changes in leukemic cell surface phenotype were probed with both ""conventional"" and monoclonal antibodies, revealing some modulation of markers in every case investigated. A diminution in the level of surface Ig (preferentially IgD) and the accumulation of cytoplasmic Ig observed after phorbol ester treatment were accompanied by a corresponding reduction or loss of the B1 antigen and usually of B2 when present. The most consistent change induced by TPA was the appearance of BB-1, a marker of activated B lymphocytes, which was rarely expressed on fresh leukemic cells. Another marker of activated lymphocytes, LB-1, was also often induced or increased in its expression after exposure of the cells to TPA. The magnitude of the TPA response appeared to relate to the stage of maturation arrest of the individual leukemic clones rather than to any clinical parameter explored.

Regulation by T lymphocytes and inflammation.,781-91,"Mouse and human (HL-60) MGI+D+ myeloid leukemic cells were induced to differentiate to mature cells in diffusion chambers implanted into the peritoneal cavity of normal mice when a xenogeneic source of serum was added to the diffusion chambers. Differentiation was inhibited in immune deficient mice including congenitally athymic nude and neonatally thymectomized mice, and mice treated with cyclophosphamide, hydrocortisone, or X-irradiation. There was no such inhibition of differentiation in mice with various genetic defects in their B lymphocytes, granulocytes, erythrocytes and natural killer cells. Differentiation in cyclophosphamide-treated mice was restored by a single intravenous injection of normal spleen cells highly enriched for T lymphocytes. Conditions permissive for differentiation were associated with a higher number of eosinophils in the peritoneum that conditions that inhibited differentiation. Intraperitoneal injections of inflammatory peritoneal exudate cells, peritoneal granulocytes, or the inflammation inducer sodium caseinate, restored the ability of defective mice to induce differentiation. Injections into defective mice of the normal mouse macrophage and granulocyte differentiation-inducing protein (MGI-2) restored differentiation of the mouse myeloid leukemic cells but not of the human myeloid leukemic cells. Differentiation of normal mouse bone marrow myeloid precursors to mature cells and of differentiation-defective (MGI-D-) mouse myeloid leukemic cells to intermediate stages of differentiation were not affected by the conditions that inhibited differentiation of the MGI+D+ myeloid leukemic cells. The results indicate: 1) that the intraperitoneal accumulation of inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, can induce differentiation of MGI+D+ leukemic cells in the peritoneal cavity; 2) that this response requires T lymphocytes and can be regulated by xenogeneic serum in the chamber; 3) that in vivo differentiation of normal and MGI+D+ myeloid leukemic cells can be regulated in different ways; and 4) that the in vivo differentiation of the mouse MGI+D+ leukemic cells, human MGI+D+ leukemic cells and mouse MGI-D- leukemic cells were induced by different compounds, so that differentiation of different types of leukemic cells may be differently regulated in vivo depending on which compounds induce differentiation.","['Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1983/12/15 00:00,1983/12/15 00:01,['1983/12/15 00:00'],"['1983/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910320620 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1983 Dec 15;32(6):781-91. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910320620.,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],,,,

These immunotoxins were prepared by conjugating ricin A chain (RIA) with our recently generated murine monoclonal antibodies, SN1 and SN2, the latter of which was obtained from a hybridoma clone N6/D11 described previously by Negoro and Seon (Cancer Res., 42: 4259-4262, 1982), directed to two unique human T-cell leukemia antigens. We have shown previously that these monoclonal antibodies do not react with non-T-leukemia cells nor with various normal cells including normal T-cells, thymocytes, and bone marrow cells (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 80: 845, 1983; Cancer Res., 42: 4259, 1982). Control conjugate was also prepared by conjugating RIA with a murine monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG), the isotype of which is the same as that of SN1 and SN2, i.e., IgG1-kappa. In initial experiments, the cytotoxic activity of an SN1 IgG:RIA conjugate preparation and the control IgG conjugate preparation against leukemic T-cell lines and normal B-cell lines was tested by two different test procedures, i.e., by measuring direct killing of the cells and by measuring inhibitory activity against protein synthesis in the cells. In each test, the SN1 conjugate showed specific cytotoxic activity against T-leukemia cells, whereas the control conjugate was not cytotoxic against either T-leukemia cells or normal B-cells. Nearly complete killing of T-leukemia cells and inhibition of protein synthesis in T-leukemia cells were observed at the concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-7) M of the SN1 IgG:RIA conjugate. In subsequent experiments, another preparation of SN1 IgG:RIA conjugate and an SN2 IgG:RIA conjugate preparation were tested individually and together for their inhibitory activity against protein synthesis in T-leukemia cells and control cells. With T-leukemia cells, specific inhibition was observed for both SN1 IgG:RIA and SN2 IgG:RIA. The combined use of these conjugates did not display a synergistic effect. Nevertheless, the combined use of different immunotoxins directed to different antigen molecules will be important in clinical use, since uncultured tumor cells derived freshly from patients, in general, display heterogeneity with respect to the expression of tumor-associated antigens. These immunotoxins may be useful for the in vitro eradication of tumor cells in the bone marrow taken from patients with T-cell leukemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Seon, B K']",['Seon BK'],['eng'],['CA19304/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Ricin/*toxicity', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/physiology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Jan;44(1):259-64.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",,,,

This was reflected in part by (a) the inhibition of cytophilic antibody receptors on peritoneal macrophages and (b) decreased phagocytic activity of the macrophages. Pyran copolymer MVE-5 given to the mice either 4 h before, or 5 or 8 days after, the Ag-Ab complexes abrogated this suppression. Macrophages from MVE-5-treated mice attached cytophilic antibodies to L1210 to the same extent as normal macrophages, despite the concomitant or previous administration of immune complexes. Macrophages from normal or immune-complex-treated mice given MVE-5 were more phagocytic than their counterparts from groups not given MVE-5. All of these effects of MVE-5 required 3-5 days to become manifest. Thymocytes or spleen T cells from mice treated with Ag-Ab complexes adoptively transfer the suppression to normal syngeneic mice. Treatment of the mice with MVE-5 4 h before the immune complexes abrogated the ability of T cells to transfer the suppression. However, MVE-5 given 5 or 8 days after Ag-Ab complexes did not affect the adoptive transfer of suppression, even when the testing of macrophages in recipients of T cells was performed 10 days after transfer. Treatment of normal mice with MVE-5 enabled their spleen or thymus T cells to prevent, but not reverse, the inhibition of macrophages upon adoptive transfer. Thus, the transfer of T cells from MVE-5-treated mice antagonized suppression if performed 4 h before administering immune complexes, whereas such ""activated"" T cells were ineffective when transferred 5 or 8 days later. MVE-5 apparently prevented the generation of suppressor inducer T cells, but once generated, these cells could not be directly antagonized by MVE-5 or by T cells stimulated by this agent. MVE-5 significantly activated peritoneal macrophages in T-cell-depleted mice, as well as in normal mice. The ability to form cytophilic antibody-mediated rosettes and to kill syngeneic B16 melanoma cells were both enhanced in the T-cell-depleted mice. Pyran copolymer MVE-5 probably exerted direct effects on peritoneal macrophages and an indirect effect through T cells in overcoming the suppressive effects of Ag-Ab complexes on macrophages.","['Rao, V S', 'Mitchell, M S']","['Rao VS', 'Mitchell MS']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Response Mod,Journal of biological response modifiers,8219656,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Polymers/*pharmacology', 'Pyran Copolymer/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Biol Response Mod. 1983;2(1):67-80.,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '27100-68-1 (Pyran Copolymer)']",,,,

In this study, certain normal lymphoid cells from AKR.H-2b mice were also found to express target antigens defined by such anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL. AKR.H-2b spleen, but surprisingly not thymus, cells stimulated the production of anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL when employed at either the in vivo priming phase or the in vitro restimulation phase of anti-viral CTL induction. This selective stimulation by spleen vs thymus cells was not dependent on the age of the mice over the range (3 to 28 wk) tested. Both AKR.H-2b spleen and thymus cells, however, were able to stimulate the generation of H-2-restricted B6 anti-AKR minor histocompatibility (H) antigen-specific CTL. Thus, AKR.H-2b spleen cells appeared to display the same sets (minor H and virus-associated) of cell surface antigens recognized by CTL as the AKR.H-2b SL1 tumor, whereas AKR.H-2b thymocytes were selectively missing the virus-associated target antigens, a situation analogous to that of cl. 18-5, a variant subclone of AKR.H-2b SL1 insusceptible to anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL. Like AKR.H-2b thymocytes, neither AKR spleen cells or thymocytes nor B6.GIX + thymocytes were able to stimulate the generation of anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL from primed B6 responder cell populations. In contrast, both T cell-enriched and B cell-enriched preparations derived from AKR.H-2b spleen cells were able to stimulate at the in vitro phase of induction, although B cell-enriched preparations were considerably more efficient. The discordant results obtained with AKR.H-2b spleen cells vs thymocytes were confirmed and extended in experiments in which these cells were employed as target cells to directly assess the cell surface expression of virus-associated, CTL-defined antigens. Thus, AKR.H-2b spleen cells, but not thymocytes, were recognized by anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL when fresh normal cells were tested as unlabeled competitive inhibitors, or when mitogen blasts were tested as labeled targets. Fresh or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated B cell-enriched spleen cells were as efficiently recognized as unseparated spleen cell preparations. Unexpectedly, fresh or Lens culinaris hemagglutinin-stimulated T cell-enriched spleen cell preparations, although susceptible to anti-minor H CTL, were almost as poor as targets for anti-viral CTL as were thymocytes.

All these patients had structural rearrangements of the long arm of chromosome No. I (Iq) in a stem line or the subline of tumor cells with a t(8;14). The rearrangements were composed of a translocation involving Iq with other chromosomes and a tandem duplication of Iq, and they were exclusively associated with a partial trisomy for Iq. Two patients with diffuse large-cell lymphoma, whose tumor cells did not express surface immunoglobulins (s-Ig), had the Iq translocation in their highly complex karyotypes. Tumor cells from the other seven patients expressed s-Ig and the karyotypes were relatively simple. Among these patients, the Iq translocation was found in two patients with Burkitt's lymphoma, and the Iq duplication were observed in a stem line or the sublines from four patients with Burkitt's lymphoma-leukemia and one each with small non-cleaved-cell or diffuse large-cell lymphoma.

This activity was contained in the immunoglobulin fraction and could be absorbed by purified FLV preparations. Optimal conditions for measuring the mitogenc activity of aFLV include 48 h preincubation of thymocytes with 3 micrograms/ml Con A followed by reculturing the activated thymocytes for 28 h with aFLV. The acquisition of an aFLV-responsive state was dependent on early protein synthesis during the Con A-induced activation period. aFLV did not substitute for interleukin 2 (IL2) in a costimulator assay. Evidence is presented that aFLV acted in a cocultivation assay via growth factor(s). In contrast to control cultures, aFLV-treated lymphoblasts contained, in their supernatants, IL2 activity as demonstrated by their effect on an IL2-dependent T cell line.

The viral proteins of the tumorigenic MuLV seem to be a part of the antigens recognized by these dually restricted anti-MuLV CTL, but the precise nature of the putative viral antigen(s) recognized by CTL is unknown. Studies using recombinant viruses have suggested that a product of the viral envelope gene (env gene), perhaps the glycoprotein gp70, is the viral antigen recognized by CTL. Attempts to use purified gp70 or anti-gp70 antibodies to block CTL recognition of retrovirus-induced tumour cells, however, have yielded contradictory results. To examine more closely the role of gp70 in the CTL response to MuLV infections, we have constructed murine cell lines which express only the env gene of the Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MuLV). We show here that BALB/c-3T3 cells expressing the M-MuLV envelope gene products on their cell surface are susceptible to lysis by M-MuLV-specific CTL.","['Flyer, D C', 'Burakoff, S J', 'Faller, D V']","['Flyer DC', 'Burakoff SJ', 'Faller DV']",['eng'],"['AI-17258/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P32 CA 09361-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05526/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",1983/10/02 00:00,1983/10/02 00:01,['1983/10/02 00:00'],"['1983/10/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/02 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/305815a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1983 Oct 27-Nov 2;305(5937):815-8. doi: 10.1038/305815a0.,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],,,,

It was found that the only CTL that were consistently inhibited in their lytic activity came from BALB.B (H-2b) mice immunized against syngeneic Gross MuLV-induced B.GV cells. These results thus showed that a subpopulation of BALB.B anti-Gross MuLV CTL recognized a Gross MuLV gag gene product expressed on the surface of B.GV cells.","['Plata, F', 'Kalil, J', 'Zilber, M T', 'Fellous, M', 'Levy, D']","['Plata F', 'Kalil J', 'Zilber MT', 'Fellous M', 'Levy D']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/physiology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis/immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1983 Nov;131(5):2551-6.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)']",,,,

Different patterns of enzyme distribution were observed in the leukaemic T-cells from these disorders. In T-PLL, reactivity for the four acid hydrolases was confined to single or a few large granules. Gall bodies were reactive for beta-glucuronidase, b-glucosaminidase and alpha-naphthylacetate esterase but apparently unreactive for acid phosphatase. In T-CLL, scattered small- to medium-size cytoplasmic granules and many parallel tubular arrays were strongly reactive for acid phosphatase, beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosidase but showed no reactivity for alpha-naphthylacetate esterase. Intermediate features were observed in ATLL. The observed differences in enzyme reactivity reflect a different content of lysosomal granules in the various types of leukaemic T-cells. They also suggest that similar differences may be found in normal T-lymphocyte subsets.","['Matutes, E', 'Crockard, A D', ""O'Brien, M"", 'Catovsky, D']","['Matutes E', 'Crockard AD', ""O'Brien M"", 'Catovsky D']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Histochem J,The Histochemical journal,0163161,IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Glucuronidase/analysis', 'Hexosaminidases/analysis', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/*analysis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/*ultrastructure', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/ultrastructure']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01011828 [doi]'],ppublish,Histochem J. 1983 Sep;15(9):895-909. doi: 10.1007/BF01011828.,"['EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",,,,

We have investigated the effects of four thymic factors: thymosin fraction 5 (TMS-F5); thymosin alpha 1 (TMS-alpha 1); thymopoietin pentapeptide (TP-5); and thymic conditioned medium (CM) on TdT activity, purine enzyme levels and the phenotypic markers OKT3 (a marker for mature T cells) and NA1/34 (which reacts with immature cortical thymocytes) in human thymocytes and in the lymphoid leukaemic cell lines RPMI-8402 and JM1 (derived from Thy-ALL). All four thymic factors caused one or more maturation change in human thymocytes, e.g. TMS-F5 caused a significant increase in OKT3 expression, TMS-alpha 1 a fall in TdT and ADA activities and a rise in OKT3-positive cells, TP-5 an increase in PNP and CM a rise in 5'NT activity. TMS-F5 also caused a marked elevation of 5'NT in both the T lymphoblastic lines (P less than 0.001). On the other hand the non-physiological phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA), a tumour promotor with potency of inducing differentiation in some leukaemic cell lines, induced changes in both normal thymocytes and in the leukaemic line JM1 were inconsistent with maturation, e.g. a fall in the percentage of OKT3 cells. These observations suggest that maturation of normal thymocytes might proceed stepwise, each step requiring at least one of the thymic hormones. Although thymosin also induces differentiation changes in a malignant lymphoid line, the pattern of these differs from that induced in their normal counterparts.","['Ho, A D', 'Ma, D D', 'Price, G', 'Hunstein, W', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Ho AD', 'Ma DD', 'Price G', 'Hunstein W', 'Hoffbrand AV']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/enzymology/immunology', 'Thymus Hormones/*physiology']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Immunology. 1983 Nov;50(3):471-6.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Thymus Hormones)']",PMC1454273,,,

Treatment of the Moloney-virus-induced H-2b lymphoma target cells, MBL-2, with tunicamycin (TM), an inhibitor of the protein-N-linked glycosilation, was found to cause a loss of susceptibility to lysis by MSV-immune syngeneic effectors cells, while the same target cells remained fully sensitive to the lytic action of anti-H-2b-immune lymphocytes. Examination of MBL-2 cell surface by lactoperoxidase, 125I iodination, and immunoprecipitation by antiviral protein sera revealed that env but not gag viral gene-encoded products were expressed on the surface of this lymphoma. The TM-induced alteration of cell surface expression of H-2Db, H-2Kb, and gp70 antigens was examined by a combined approach of serological and biochemical techniques. The results were concordant in indicating that (1) after 16 h of TM treatment the cells showed a decreased expression of the three glycoproteins, (2) H-2Db (the restriction element in this system) resulted more affected by the treatment than its counterpart H-2Kb (75% vs 50% reduction as compared to untreated cells), (3) an additional lighter form of H-2Kb was found on the surface of TM-treated cells. In the context of an ""associative recognition' of Db and gp70 by MSV-immune effector cells, our results may explain the loss of susceptibility to antitumor effectors of TM-treated MBL-2 cells by a quantitative reduction in the expression of both molecules which interact to create the target structure of syngeneic effectors.","['Colombo, M P', 'Pierotti, M A', 'Ballinari, D', 'Parmiani, G']","['Colombo MP', 'Pierotti MA', 'Ballinari D', 'Parmiani G']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'H-2 Antigens/*analysis/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tunicamycin', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/analysis/immunology']",1983/08/01 00:00,1983/08/01 00:01,['1983/08/01 00:00'],"['1983/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0171-2985(83)80059-X [pii]', '10.1016/S0171-2985(83)80059-X [doi]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1983 Aug;165(2):186-99. doi: 10.1016/S0171-2985(83)80059-X.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)']",,,,

Cultured cells from IL-2-dependent lines were found to retain their original histocompatibility and differentiation antigen characteristics for up to 2 yr. Mortality patterns, comparing long-term cloned leukemic T cell lines with fresh AKR leukemia cells, showed that the cloned cells had greater tumorigenicity. An especially interesting finding was that cell lines established both from different mice and from a single organ of an individual mouse were heterogeneous with respect to antigenic makeup, cell growth kinetics, and tumorigenicity.

We now show that further purification of crude SGF by reverse-phase HPLC on muBondapak C18 and CN columns at pH 2 resolves it into two distinctly different polypeptides, which we call types alpha and beta transforming growth factors (TGFs). Type alpha TGF (TGF-alpha), but not type beta TGF (TGF-beta), competes for binding to the EGF receptor and induces the formation of small colonies (1,000-2,000 micron2) of normal rat kidney cells in soft agar. Both TGF-beta and EGF or TGF-alpha must be present in order to induce the formation of large colonies (7,000-15,000 micron2). Based on EGF competing equivalents as determined from a radioreceptor assay with 125I-labeled EGF in normal rat kidney cells, the relative ability of EGF and TGF-alpha to potentiate TGF-beta-dependent colony formation is in the order conditioned-medium TGF-alpha greater than EGF greater than intracellular TGF-alpha. Suboptimal concentrations of the same polypeptides give additive potentiation of the TGF-beta-dependent colony-forming response; saturating levels potentiate a similar maximum response whether used alone or in various combinations. The data indicate that the EGF-competing activity of crude SGF is due to its TGF-alpha component alone, whereas the soft-agar colony-forming activity is due to the combined action of two distinct polypeptides, TGF-alpha and TGF-beta.","['Anzano, M A', 'Roberts, A B', 'Smith, J M', 'Sporn, M B', 'De Larco, J E']","['Anzano MA', 'Roberts AB', 'Smith JM', 'Sporn MB', 'De Larco JE']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/physiology', 'Growth Substances/*isolation & purification', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Peptides/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Transforming Growth Factors']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.80.20.6264 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1983 Oct;80(20):6264-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.80.20.6264.,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Peptides)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)']",PMC394276,,,

From one of these lymphatic leukemias we established a permanent cell line which we named RLD (Rauscher Lymphoid DBA/2). Phenotyping of this cell line with a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed to cell-surface determinants shows that RLD cells have T-cell characteristics: they bind monoclonal antibodies directed to the antigens Thy-1, T-200 and Lyt-1; they do not react with anti-Lyt-2 antibodies, nor do they react with antibodies directed to determinants on B cells or myelomonocytic cells. RLD cells show a high activity of the nuclear enzyme terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT). RLD cells are able to differentiate after in vitro stimulation with 1% DMSO or with 30 nM tetradecanoylphorbol-1.3-acetate (TPA). This differentiation process is reflected by (1) changes in the 2D gel electrophoresis pattern of metabolically labelled proteins, (2) a decrease in TdT activity and (3) changes in the expression of cell-surface markers. Flow cytometric analysis of stimulated RLD cells shows a strong increase in the Lyt-1 expression. Together these data indicate that RLD cells are immature T lymphocytes which upon appropriate stimulation differentiate along the line of T helper cells.","['de Both, N J', 'Rhijnsburger, E H', 'van Ewijk, W']","['de Both NJ', 'Rhijnsburger EH', 'van Ewijk W']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Rauscher Virus', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/ultrastructure']",1983/10/15 00:00,1983/10/15 00:01,['1983/10/15 00:00'],"['1983/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910320418 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1983 Oct 15;32(4):501-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910320418.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,

The levels of normal B- and T-cells were compared to each other as well as those of their CLL counterparts. Unfractionated CLL lymphocytes, predominantly B-cells, had significantly lower levels of adenosine-5'-triphosphate, cytidine-5'-triphosphate, uridine-5'-triphosphate, cytidine-5'-diphosphate, and guanosine-5'-phosphate, while the concentration of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide was significantly higher than in normal unfractionated lymphocytes which consisted mainly of T-cells. For enriched populations: (a) CLL B-cells had much lower adenosine-5'-triphosphate (3439 versus 5689) (pmol/1 X 10(7) cells), cytidine-5'-triphosphate (107 versus 313), guanosine-5'-triphosphate (462 versus 978), and uridine-5'-triphosphate (633 versus 1214) than normal B-cells; (b) CLL T-enriched subpopulations had significantly lower ribonucleoside triphosphates, adenosine-5'-triphosphate (3217 versus 5468), cytidine-5'-triphosphate (119 versus 209), guanosine-5'-triphosphate (422 versus 826), and uridine-5'-triphosphate (504 versus 969) than normal T-cells. The lower ribonucleoside triphosphate levels found in unfractionated CLL lymphocytes, therefore, are the result of differences between the CLL and normal B-cells as well as between CLL and normal T-cells. These findings establish a framework for studying the reasons underlying the decreased ribonucleoside triphosphate levels in unfractionated CLL lymphocytes. T-helper and T-suppressor lymphocytes showed similar ribonucleotide patterns. Nucleoside and base levels were significantly higher in normal monocytes than in normal lymphocytes. The only compound found to be increased in the CLL B-lymphocytes when compared to their normal counterparts was nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide.

Although diagnosis of a primary malignancy usually preceded detection of the breast lesion, 40% (6/16) had no history of malignancy. Prognosis remains poor; however, it has improved in the lymphoma-leukemia group due to improved immunotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic regimens. The clinical, radiologic, and pathologic features are discussed. Some of the lesions encountered can be confused with a primary breast malignancy or a benign lesion, necessitating prompt and accurate biopsy to preclude unnecessary major surgery and to improve survival in cancers amenable to current therapy.","['McCrea, E S', 'Johnston, C', 'Haney, P J']","['McCrea ES', 'Johnston C', 'Haney PJ']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

The cells form E-rosettes, have no surface-membrane-bound Ig, but Fc-receptors for IgG. With monoclonal antibodies, the phenotype is OKT3+, OKT4- and OKT8+, theoretically corresponding to the suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocyte subset, but functionally the cells demonstrate killer cell (responsible for ADCC), but not natural or suppressor cell activity. (ii) another clinical variant with an aggressive course, massive hepato-splenomegaly, lymph node enlargement and very high lymphocyte counts; the lymphocytes are small without cytoplasmic granules; their immunological and functional characteristics have not been determined, but morphologically the cells correspond to the T helper/inducer lymphocyte subset.

The HTLV-infected cells generally belonged to a class of mature T cells (OKT4+ and Leu 3A+) and differed from the normal uninfected cells in that they could be propagated in culture indefinitely; possessed altered morphology, including convoluted nuclei and some bi- and multinucleated giant cells; formed large clumps in culture; demonstrated a diminished requirement for TCGF; had an increased density of TCGF receptors; often became completely independent of exogenous TCGF; and expressed HLA-DR determinants.

Cell surface antigens of HL-60 cells before and after TPA treatment were studied with monoclonal antibodies and four hybridoma clones producing IgM antibodies were established. Two antibodies (HL-21 and HL-47) reacted only with the immunizing TPA-treated HL-60 cells, and HL-1 antibody produced against untreated cells was reactive with both TPA-treated and untreated cells, but HL-5 antibody reacted predominantly with the immunizing untreated cells. Serological reactivity against various types of normal hematopoietic cells and acute leukemias (diagnosed by the French-American-British classification) was studied by immune adherence assay and immuno-electron microscopy. HL-21 antibody was reactive with monocytes and most cases of M4 and M5 types of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia cells. HL-47 antibody did not react with the cells of myelocyte-monocyte lineage or mature lymphocytes, but it did react with one-third of acute lymphocytic leukemia (L1 and L2) cases. Since all HL-47+ cases were included in the group of common ALL antigen positive cases, it was estimated that HL-47 is a differentiation antigen present on lymphocyte precursors, from which null-cell type acute lymphocytic leukemia cells generally originate. HL-1 antibody reacted with the cells of myelocyte-monocyte lineage as well as those of most acute non-lymphocytic leukemias. HL-5 antibody reacted with granulocytes and M2 type of acute myelocytic leukemia cases, and also with M5 type of acute monocytic leukemia cases. Serological studies of these antibodies revealed that TPA can induce to differentiate HL-60 cells not only into HL-21+ macrophage-like cells, but also into HL-47+ lymphoid stem cells.

We report that some human lymphoblastoid T cell lines, lacking EBV-DNA in their genome, do activate the human alternative C pathway with no participation of immunoglobulin or specific antibodies. Nevertheless, activation measured by C3 deposition on the cell surface was weaker than with the B cell lines so far studied; in relation to the RAJl cells, C3 deposition on JURKAT, MOLT 4, HSB2, and 1301 was, respectively, 68, 38, 28, and 19%. Furthermore, C3 deposition on JURKAT T cell line requires D, whereas RAJl cells provide a proteolytic activity able to mimic D, and which, unlike D, can be controlled by serum protease inhibitors. Although the ability to activate the AP seems to be a largely shared property of the human lymphoblastoid B and T cell lines, the situation was strikingly different with normal and mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes or with acute leukemic cells, which led to a negligible AP-dependent C3 deposition compared with the level observed with the lymphoblastoid cell lines. Membrane sialic acid content was determined for every cell tested and revealed no relationship with their ability to activate the AP.

These studies were initiated in order to provide the basis for studies of human blood T and B lymphocytes and malignant lymphocytes. Methylaminoisobutyric acid (methyl-AIB) and 2-amino-2-carboxy-bicyclo (2,2,1) heptane (BCH) uptakes into lymphocytes were measured as prototypes of A- and L-system amino acid transport.

In contrast, the Michaelis constant for BCH uptake was 63 microM; the maximal velocity was 969 mumol/L cell water/min, and the diffusion coefficient was .141 min-1. The transport of the naturally occurring amino acids, alanine, proline, and leucine was defined by studies of: (1) competitive inhibition with the system-specific synthetic amino acids, methyl-AIB and BCH, (2) the effect of the transcellular sodium gradient on transport, and (3) evaluation of the time-dependent increase of transport in amino acid-deficient medium (adaptation). Alanine was transported principally (approximately 70%) by the ASC-system, and leucine was transported principally (70%) by the L-system in lymphocytes. The analysis of proline transport was more complex because of a large component of uptake by diffusion even at low amino acid concentrations. Taken together, the kinetics of sodium-sensitive uptake and the results of competitive inhibition studies indicated that proline was transported by the A-system (30%), the ASC system (30%), and also by the L-system (15%).","['Segel, G B', 'Simon, W', 'Lichtman, M A']","['Segel GB', 'Simon W', 'Lichtman MA']",['eng'],"['CA12970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Amino Acids/*blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Biological Transport', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Diffusion', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Sodium/blood', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041160315 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1983 Sep;116(3):372-8. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041160315.,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)']",,,,

Development of specific antitumor immunity in progressors and regressors.,385-91,"The present study was aimed at comparing the development of specific antitumor immunity between hosts with progressively growing tumors and hosts with regressing tumors. The experiments were performed with a Friend virus-induced leukemia FBL-3 in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. The specific antitumor immunity was determined by in vitro cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay and in vivo tumor neutralization test. Both the systemic immunity (demonstrated in spleen) and immunity developed at tumor site were examined. For progressors, the tumor site was in the peritoneal cavity. For regressors, it was in a subcutaneous site of both flanks. Testing by the cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay showed that immune hosts and regressors had higher levels of systemic immunity than the progressors. However, when lymphocytes isolated from tumor sites were assayed, it was found that there was no remarkable difference between lymphocytes from progressor tumors (PTL) and lymphocytes from regressor tumors (RTL). Both lymphocyte populations were similar in profile analysis; they were characterized as T cells and possessed the same antigenic specificity. Nevertheless, when in vivo tumor transplantation experiments were performed, RTL were found to give protection against FBL-3 challenge whereas PTL consistently failed to do so. On cytomorphological examination, the PTL were seen to contain large amounts of macrophages. The presence of macrophages in PTL appeared to have an inverse relationship to the in vivo protective effect. After removal of macrophages from PTL by Petri dish adherence, the nonadherent PTL were found to give in vivo protection. Furthermore, thymocytes from progressors and macrophages isolated from the progressor tumors were found to suppress the in vivo T-cell-mediated immunity. These findings demonstrated that suppressor T cells and suppressor macrophages were present in tumor-bearing hosts. These suppressor cells could interfere with the function of immune T cells at the efferent arm of the immune response.","['Ting, C C', 'Zhang, S R']","['Ting CC', 'Zhang SR']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Immune Tolerance', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1983/09/15 00:00,1983/09/15 00:01,['1983/09/15 00:00'],"['1983/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910320320 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1983 Sep 15;32(3):385-91. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910320320.,,,,,

When relapsed, the cytostasis activity was markedly impaired. These results demonstrate that the assay of MNC cytostasis activity is a useful tool to predict or detect relapse of ALL at an earlier time. The cytostasis activity was still decreased after the cessation of chemotherapy for ALL, demonstrating a characteristic immunologic defect in ALL.","['Kawai, H', 'Hirabayashi, S', 'Miyagawa, Y', 'Komiyama, A', 'Akabane, T']","['Kawai H', 'Hirabayashi S', 'Miyagawa Y', 'Komiyama A', 'Akabane T']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/immunology/*physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19831001)52:7<1215::aid-cncr2820520715>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1983 Oct 1;52(7):1215-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19831001)52:7<1215::aid-cncr2820520715>3.0.co;2-5.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,

Intrinsic to this study was the expression of a number of B-cell antigens defined by monoclonal antibodies. These included antibodies to B1 and B2, both expressed exclusively on B lymphocytes, but with the latter probably restricted to a narrow window of differentiation, BB-1 and LB-1, both markers of activated lymphocytes, and 38.13, a monoclonal antibody raised against and recognizing an epitope expressed on Burkitt lymphoma cells. While the patterns of reactivities were complex, the cases could be classified into various groups on the basis of the phenotypes revealed. These were termed ""pre-B,"" ""early-B,"" ""intermediate-B,"" ""mature-B,"" and ""secretory-B"" from their patterns of immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype expression and their capacity to secrete Ig in short-term culture. Although B1 was detected on neoplastic cells from all but one case, its intensity of expression varied markedly, being strongest on the ""mature-B"" and ""secretory-B"" cases and weakest on the ""pre-B"" type. The expression of B2 was essentially restricted to the ""intermediate-B,"" ""mature-B,"" and ""secretory-B"" cases and was usually, but not invariably, accompanied by the coexpression of surface IgM and IgD. While expression of BB-1 was restricted to a few cases with mature features, LB-1 was more frequently detected and found predominantly on ""intermediate-B"" and ""mature-B"" cases. The 38.13 antibody was found to react weakly with a number of the populations coexpressing IgM and IgD. The export of large amounts of whole Ig was restricted to three ""secretory-B"" cases all of which were associated with a serum M-component corresponding to the Ig isotype secreted in vitro. In contrast, the secretion of free Ig light chains was a consistent feature of all B-LL, and the amounts detected did not vary considerably between the different types. No correlation between immunologic cell-type and the stage of the disease was apparent. Classification of the cases into ""true"" B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia and immunocytoma similarly revealed no strict association of these histopathologic entities with any particular phenotypic group, although those cases with the more mature features tended to be immunocytomas.

Both antibodies reacted with most cell lines derived from patients with T lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), but were not detected on suspensions of normal hematopoietic cells (including thymocytes) by cytotoxicity, absorption, or indirect immunofluorescence assays. Analysis of fresh leukemic cells indicated that anti-3-3 only reacted with T-ALL cells, while anti-3-40 also reacted with some non-T, non-B ALL cells and a few acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) cells. The 3-40 antigen was also found histopathologically in frozen sections of several normal tissues, including the epithelial cells and a few lymphoid cells of the thymus, and some malignant tissues. The 3-3 antigen was not found in any tissue studied. A ""double absorption""assay provided additional serologic evidence that the two antibodies identify different antigenic determinants. Biochemical analysis indicated that the molecules immunoprecipitated by anti-3-3 and anti-3-40 have molecular weights of 35,000-40,000 daltons. This study demonstrated that the 3-3 and 3-40 antigens are markers for human T-ALL and can be used along with the normal T-lymphocyte antigen, 3A1, to discriminate T-ALL from cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), and T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (T-CLL).","['Naito, K', 'Knowles, R W', 'Real, F X', 'Morishima, Y', 'Kawashima, K', 'Dupont, B']","['Naito K', 'Knowles RW', 'Real FX', 'Morishima Y', 'Kawashima K', 'Dupont B']",['eng'],"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tissue Distribution']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85088-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1983 Oct;62(4):852-65.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",,,,

The lymphomas were classified by the Kiel convention. B cell leukaemia in the context of this paper refers to the situation where a neoplastic clone of B cells in the blood greatly outnumbers normal blood B cells. It is defined as an absolute blood B cell count greater than 0.75 X 10(9)1(-1) where either greater than 90% B cells express kappa immunoglobulin light chains or greater than 80% express lambda light chains. This was found in several patients where the total blood lymphocyte count was within normal limits.

Spontaneous mouse red cell rosette formation also characterised leukaemic B cells in these three groups but high proportions of mouse rosetting cells were seen only in association with ML-BCLL. None of 4 cases of prolymphocytic leukaemia showed mouse red cell rosetting. HLA-DR alpha chain was found on the leukaemic cells of all patients except one with ML-BCLL.

These cases were anti-ATLA [antibody to ATL virus (ATLV)-associated antigen (ATLA)] positive, and tumor cells had the inducer/helper T-cell phenotype and expressed ATLA when cultured, indicating that these diseases are the same as typical ATL, even though their clinical diagnoses were different from ATL. Accordingly, they are called atypical ATL. Clinically, they could be divided into two subtypes, smoldering type and lymphoma type. In the smoldering type, the disease usually started with skin lesions and rarely with lung lesions. After a prodromal stage of several years, the disease progressed insidiously to the leukemic stage without additional manifestations. The flower cells characteristic of typical ATL were observed in only a small percentage of peripheral lymphoid cells. In two of the five patients the disease progressed to typical ATL after several years from onset. All five patients are alive with a long survival time, more than 6 yr in four, and had high titers of anti-ATLA, suggesting that anti-ATLA might have some role in regulating the proliferation of ATL cells in vivo. In the lymphoma type, morphological diagnosis was not always specific for discriminating ATL-related from ATL-unrelated T-cell lymphomas. Detection of anti-ATLA in the patient's serum and of ATLA in cultured tumor cells, examination of the sera of members of the patient's family for anti-ATLA, and observation of typical flower cells in the peripheral blood though the patients had neither lymphocytosis nor leukemic changes, seem to be useful for the discrimination, especially in an ATL-nonendemic area. Members of the family of a patient with anti-ATLA positive T-lymphoma in an ATL-nonendemic area were also anti-ATLA positive, indicating that healthy ATLV carriers in an ATL-nonendemic area exist as a family colony. This is responsible for sporadic outbreaks of ATL in an ATL-nonendemic area.

Probes used were molecularly cloned DNA containing the respective oncogene sequence of avian erythroblastosis virus, myelocytomatosis virus (MC29) and myeloblastosis virus. All lymphoma-leukemia cells irrespective of B, T or non-B/non-T lymphocyte lineage expressed the c-erbB locus. This gene was also found to be active in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and lymphocytes from lymph nodes showing reactive hyperplasia. This observation suggested that c-erbB might be normally involved in cell growth functions since it was not unique to hematopoietic malignancies. In contrast to c-erbB, elevated expressions of c-myc or c-myb were detected in certain neoplasms of B-lymphocytes and some other lymphoproliferative disorders as compared to the majority of the samples tested which showed either low or undetectable levels of these transcripts. An examination of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias in which the majority of the cellular populations expressed either Kappa or lambda surface lg light chain molecules revealed variations in the levels of c-onc transcripts within a morphologic and immunologic subtype. These findings support the notion that, in general, genetic heterogeneity exists in groups of hematopoietic proliferations defined by conventional histopathologic and immunologic criteria. Although with the majority of the specimens there was no obvious correlation between the morphologic cell type of lymphoma/leukemia and the c-onc RNA levels, interestingly two of the three samples diagnosed as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell type, showed considerably increased transcription of the c-myc gene relative to the other B-cell neoplasms. Thus a class of differentiated B-cell leukemia has been identified in which the molecular mechanisms which affect c-myc gene expression can now be investigated.","['Roy-Burman, P', 'Devi, B G', 'Parker, J W']","['Roy-Burman P', 'Devi BG', 'Parker JW']",['eng'],"['CA-19449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Oncogenes', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure']",1983/08/15 00:00,1983/08/15 00:01,['1983/08/15 00:00'],"['1983/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910320208 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1983 Aug 15;32(2):185-91. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910320208.,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,

Lymph node infiltrates are initially restricted to the paracortical zone, with preservation of the nodal shape and subcapsular sinus, and accompanied by a proliferation of post-capillary venules. Cytologically, a range of cell types is present, from smaller cells with irregularly shaped nuclei and clumped nuclear chromatin to larger cells with dispersed chromatin and more prominent nucleoli, apparently corresponding to the stages of peripheral T-lymphocyte transformation. The proportion of each cell type present varies from case to case, as do the numbers of admixed eosinophils, plasma cells and interdigitating reticulum cells. These histological appearances are very similar to those of the pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma described in Japan, which also shows many clinical similarities, including a high incidence of complicating hypercalcaemia. There is a strong association in both Japanese and Caribbean patients with a recently described human retrovirus, HTLV, which occurs endemically in those areas where the disease clusters. Morphological similarities exist between ATLL and other peripheral T-cell lymphomata and leukaemias. These are illustrated by one notable 'linking' case.

The present report describes the reactivity of the anti-Y 29/55 antibody with bone marrow cells obtained from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia using an indirect immunofluorescence method in combination with morphological and cytokinetic studies. In 25 patients (acute lymphoblastic leukemia subtype: 14 common; 4 pre-B-cell; 4 null; and 3 T-cell), a maximum of 2% of cells (small lymphocytes) were stained. One patient presented with blasts exhibiting cytoplasmic and surface immunoglobulin M (IgM) (pre-B-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia). About 11% of this patient's blast cells showed a positive reaction with anti-Y 29/55. They could not be differentiated by morphological criteria from the anti-Y 29/55-negative blast cell population. In another patient with pre-B-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, only 1% of anti-Y 29/55-positive cells was found. In bone marrow of children with relative lymphocytosis, 1.4 to 8.7% of mononuclear cells reacted with anti-Y 29/55. Morphologically, these cells were small lymphocytes and predominantly expressed surface IgM. In two of these children, a further subdivision of bone marrow cells could be achieved by combining anti-Y 29/55 and cytoplasmic IgM reactivity with [3H]thymidine pulse labeling. These studies revealed that the actively proliferating, normal pre-B-cell population was anti-Y 29/55-nonreactive, whereas a nonproliferating population of anti-Y 29/55-reactive, cytoplasmic IgM-positive cells probably represented B-cells with surface immunoglobulin M reacting when cytoplasmic IgM was assessed. We conclude that the reactivity of the monoclonal anti-B-cell antibody (anti-Y 29/55) is restricted to surface immunoglobulin-positive bone marrow cells and that neither leukemic or normal pre-B-cells nor common, null-cell, or T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia blasts react.","['Hirt, A', 'Baumgartner, C', 'Forster, H K', 'Imbach, P', 'Wagner, H P']","['Hirt A', 'Baumgartner C', 'Forster HK', 'Imbach P', 'Wagner HP']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Sep;43(9):4483-5.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",,,,

Trisomy 12 was demonstrated in three cases but not as the primary change. Spleen cells in two patients showed a higher frequency of abnormalities than in the PB, supporting the concept of the spleen being the organ primarily involved in B-PLL. Evidence of karyotypic evolution was demonstrated in six patients, in some clearly associated with clinical progression of the disease. The type and frequency of the abnormalities observed in B-PLL resemble those seen in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and suggest major differences from B-CLL, although a relationship with the latter can not be completely ruled out at present.","['Pittman, S', 'Catovsky, D']","['Pittman S', 'Catovsky D']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens']",1983/08/01 00:00,1983/08/01 00:01,['1983/08/01 00:00'],"['1983/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(83)90084-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(83)90084-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1983 Aug;9(4):355-65. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(83)90084-5.,['0 (Mitogens)'],,,,

Two types of molecules (membrane and secreted) were found in the IgG-bearing CLL cells from three patients. In all of them, secretion was detected. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that cells from the secreting clones had the features of more mature lymphocytes than the cells from nonsecreting clones. These features were represented by a developed Golgi apparatus, various types of vesicles (smooth and coated), and strands of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. A certain heterogeneity of the degree of maturation of the cells was observed within these clones.

We have examined whether leukemic cells of non-T-cell origin are capable of accumulating deoxyribonucleotides in culture and whether this capability correlates with the activities of purine metabolizing enzymes in these cells. We have found that non-T, non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells with low ecto-5'-nucleotidase and high adenosine deaminase activities increase their dATP pools by greater than tenfold when exposed to deoxyadenosine and an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase in culture. Cells from 2 of 9 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 4 of 11 patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia achieved similar elevations in dATP, but there was no relationship between dATP accumulation and adenosine deaminase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, or ecto-5'-nucleotidase activities. Treatment of four individuals with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the adenosine deaminase inhibitor, 2'-deoxycoformycin, resulted in elevations in plasma deoxyadenosine concentrations and in increments in lymphoblast dATP levels that were similar to those measured in lymphoblasts cultured with deoxyadenosine and deoxycoformycin prior to treatment.

According to our protocol 721, 745, and 765 studies, between 40% and 60% of children with ALL are now on long-term survival, even after discontinuation of the therapy for several years. However, results are not nearly as good in patients who have identifiable poor risk features. A review of 162 patients with ALL was undertaken to determine the important factors, other than therapy, influencing survival. Childhood ALL can be divided into two groups according to major prognostic factors such as age and initial leukocyte counts; Group I -standard risk group and Group II -high risk group. To minimize side effects while trying to improve further efficacy of therapy and to prevent late relapse, our new protocol 811 has been initiated for standard risk patients of ALL. The more aggressive use of current agents such as methotrexate and adriamycin to prevent early relapse has been applied for high risk patients of ALL. The preliminary results of protocol 811 showed that early intensification with high-dose methotrexate and adriamycin seemed to prolong the remission duration of high risk ALL, but further long follow-up study is needed. With considerable progress being made toward the cure of childhood leukemias, the issue of late effects assumes increasing importance.

Some viruses appear to specifically alter macrophage activity, while other viruses preferentially affect activity of lymphocytes, both B and T cells. There are many mechanisms involved in immune derangement during virus infection, including the possibility that viruses preferentially interact with selected classes of immunocompetent cells. Alternately, some of the events associated with viral derangement of the immune response may be associated with the release or formation of factors by cells infected with a virus which affects other cells of the immune system. Similarly, the development of immune complexes resulting from the interaction of viruses or their components with antibody directed to the virus may influence the immune response, as well as induce other immunopathologic manifestations. Many model systems have been studied, especially those with viruses important to human infection. It is noteworthy that leukemia viruses and, in some cases, other tumor associated viruses may directly alter the immune response, usually before other manifestations of the tumorigenic process is evident. Tumor virus-induced immunomodulation is associated with direct effects of a virus on immunocompetent cells per se as well as the formation of soluble factors induced by the virus infection. These and other considerations indicate that interactions of viruses with the host immune defense system are an important consideration in understanding how virus infection is initiated and progresses, and how such infection affects the host's physiologic activity, including immunocompetence, per se.","['Friedman, H', 'Specter, S', 'Bendinelli, M']","['Friedman H', 'Specter S', 'Bendinelli M']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Virus Diseases/*immunology', 'Viruses/*immunology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4684-4481-0_42 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1983;162:463-74. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4684-4481-0_42.,,,,,

(1) Cytotoxicity of spleen cells was profoundly suppressed by an intravenous injection of 1 microgram cholera toxin on the day of tumor inoculation. Tumors continued to grow progressively. (2) Differentiation of memory cells to mature CTL was suppressed by cholera toxin injection on the day of booster inoculation of EL-4 cells. The tumors grew progressively in immune mice given cholera toxin on the day of the booster. (3) In vitro treatment of CTL with cholera toxin suppressed the expression of their cytotoxic activity to a considerable extent. However, tumors regressed very rapidly after rechallenge to immune mice carrying CTL, even when cholera toxin was injected on the day of rechallenge. Cholera toxin suppressed not only the functional expression of CTL but also the induction phase of CTL generation.","['Tsuru, S', 'Nomoto, K', 'Oka, M', 'Zinnaka, Y']","['Tsuru S', 'Nomoto K', 'Oka M', 'Zinnaka Y']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Scotland,J Clin Lab Immunol,Journal of clinical & laboratory immunology,7808987,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholera Toxin/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects', 'Thymectomy']",1983/04/01 00:00,1983/04/01 00:01,['1983/04/01 00:00'],"['1983/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Clin Lab Immunol. 1983 Apr;10(4):209-14.,['9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)'],,,,

In immunofluorescence assays, antibody T305 reacted with a subpopulation of T cells in normal blood (22 +/- 6%), thymus (28 +/- 11%), and lymph node (24 +/- 6%). Increased frequency of T cells reactive with antibody T305 was found in peripheral blood of patients with infectious mononucleosis (greater than 80%), graft-vs-host disease after bone marrow transplantation (65 +/- 11%), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (53 +/- 12%). The T cells in synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis had increased frequency of antibody T305 reactive cells (59 +/- 8%) as compared to their peripheral blood (18 +/- 7%). Two color immunofluorescent studies demonstrated that the T305+ T cells predominantly co-stained with antibody Leu 2a (suppressor/cytotoxic subset) in both normals and disease state blood. After cell sorting to obtain T305+ and T305- subpopulations, we demonstrated that a) natural killer and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity in normal blood was in the T305+ but not T305- T cells; b) cytotoxic T cells induced by mixed lymphocyte reaction were predominantly T305+; c) T305- T cells could be induced in vitro to express T305 antigen by mitogens or allogeneic B cells; d) the DNA content of T305+ and T305- T cells in normal blood was similar (greater 95% of cells with G0/G1 level); e) after mitogen stimulation, T305 antigen induction on previously T305- cells occurs before S-phase; and f) significantly more [3H]-thymidine after mitogen stimulation was incorporated by originally T305- cells than by originally T305+ cells (p less than 0.001). The T305 antigen was not restricted to T cells because it was also found on myeloid precursors in bone marrow but was not present on polymorphonuclear leukocytes, red blood cells, platelets, muscle, liver, skin, kidney, lung, or brain. Antibody T305 was found on 24/25 cases of acute leukemia (6 T-ALL, 10/11 cALL, 7 AML, and 1 AMOL) but not on 18 cases of chronic leukemia (B-CLL, T-CLL, null CLL, CML). The importance of the T305 antigen is that it is present on a high number of T cells in certain autoimmune diseases and on virtually all acute leukemia cells. Its distribution on immature and in vitro activated cells suggests that it may represent a receptor for signals related to cellular replication or differentiation.","['Fox, R I', 'Hueniken, M', 'Fong, S', 'Behar, S', 'Royston, I', 'Singhal, S K', 'Thompson, L']","['Fox RI', 'Hueniken M', 'Fong S', 'Behar S', 'Royston I', 'Singhal SK', 'Thompson L']",['eng'],"['AG 02267/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Weight', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1983/08/01 00:00,1983/08/01 00:01,['1983/08/01 00:00'],"['1983/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1983 Aug;131(2):762-7.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,

The T-CLL cells also proliferated in response to 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), or to TPA in combination with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). These TPA-mediated proliferative responses were transient, and only small but significant amounts of IL-2 activity were generated. In contrast, no IL-2 activity was produced after the T-CLL cells had been stimulated with PHA only. The T-CLL cells that were induced to proliferate with PHA and exogenous IL-2 could be maintained in continuous culture by the addition of exogenous IL-2 at regular intervals. These continuously proliferating T-CLL cells failed to produce IL-2 constitutively. However, they could be induced to produce IL-2 activity by stimulation with TPA or TPA plus PHA. Irradiation of the proliferating T-CLL cells prior to incubation with TPA or TPA plus PHA resulted in a 9-fold increase in IL-2 activity, suggesting that the proliferating T-CLL cells were able to consume the IL-2 they produced. Studies on the presence of human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV) in the fresh and proliferating T-CLL cells revealed that 12% of the fresh cells expressed the HTLV p19 structural core protein. HTLV p19 expression was strongly enhanced in the T-CLL cells induced to proliferate by TPA (66%) and in the continuously growing IL-2-dependent T-CLL cells (82%). In the latter culture, but not in the fresh T-CLL cells, type-C virus particles were observed. These results indicate that HTLV expression correlates with T-CLL cell proliferation but not with IL-2 production by these cells.","['Vyth-Dreese, F A', 'de Vries, J E']","['Vyth-Dreese FA', 'de Vries JE']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/microbiology', 'Lymphoma/microbiology', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/*growth & development', 'T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology']",1983/07/15 00:00,1983/07/15 00:01,['1983/07/15 00:00'],"['1983/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910320109 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1983 Jul 15;32(1):53-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910320109.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",,,,

MGI-1 also induces production of the differentiation-inducing protein MGI-2, and this induction of a differentiation-inducing protein by a growth-inducing protein provides a mechanism for the normal coupling of growth and differentiation. It is shown that this induction of MGI-2 by MGI-1 occurs in the myeloid precursors and not in some other cells in the normal bone marrow, that the induced MGI-2 can be detected 6 h after the addition of MGI-1, and that MGI-2 can be induced in these cells by purified MGI-1. There are clones of myeloid leukemic cells that no longer require MGI-1 for cell viability and multiplication, but in which this requirement for MGI-1 can be restored after induction of differentiation by MGI-2. A similar concentration of MGI-1 was required for the optimum induction of growth in these differentiating leukemic cells and in normal myeloid precursors. In the presence of MGI-1 these differentiating leukemic cells multiplied and then lost their differentiation-associated properties. In contrast to normal myeloid cells, MGI-1 did not induce MGI-2 in the MGI-1 requiring differentiating myeloid leukemic cells. This lack of induction of MGI-2 by MGI-1 occurred in cells cultured in serum-containing or serum-free-medium, and can explain the loss of differentiation-associated properties. The results indicate that there has been a genetic breakdown of the normal coupling mechanism between growth and differentiation in these leukemic cells so that MGI-1 can no longer induce MGI-2.","['Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice']",1983/07/15 00:00,1983/07/15 00:01,['1983/07/15 00:00'],"['1983/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910320120 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1983 Jul 15;32(1):127-34. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910320120.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,,

Studies using fluorescein-labeled EBV and flow cytometry revealed an unusual and consistent deficiency in EBV receptors in all patients examined. In control studies, about 15% of the unseparated lymphocytes from healthy donors bound fluorescein-labeled EBV. In spite of the lack of EBV receptors, B-lymphocytes amounted to 10 to 20% of the preleukemia lymphocyte populations, a proportion similar to that in healthy donors. When lymphocytes from preleukemic patients were first implanted with functional EBV receptors and then exposed to EBV, synthesis of EBV-determined nuclear, early, and viral capsid antigens was induced. Subsequently, several cell lines originating from preleukemic patients' lymphocytes were established. These lines are of a B-lymphocyte origin and carry EBV genome.

Variable inhibition was seen at concentrations of 10(-4) M, and prior exposure to phytohemagglutinin increased sensitivity only to sex steroid hormones. In contrast to T-CFC, which showed little variation in patterns of steroid hormone inhibition in vitro, CLL-CFC from individual patients displayed widely varying sensitivity to all hormones tested; 50% inhibitory dose varied by as much as 2 logs. T-CFC were fairly resistant to a 1-hr exposure to achievable concentrations of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-cytosine, 5-fluorouracil, chlorambucil, melphalan, cisplatin, methotrexate, Adriamycin, and bleomycin. Prior exposure to phytohemagglutinin resulted in increased sensitivity only to low concentrations of Adriamycin, a phenomenon that appeared related to prior or concurrent lectin exposure and not to changes in cell cycle status. CLL-CFC showed variable sensitivity to Adriamycin and cisplatin, and concurrent exposure to lectin and Adriamycin did not increase sensitivity to that drug. CLL cells displayed much greater sensitivity to a 1-hr exposure to antimetabolites and bleomycin than to continuous exposure to the same drugs. In contrast to normal T-CFC, CLL-CFC exposed to methotrexate were not ""rescued"" by subsequent culture in media and fetal bovine serum. Incubation of T-CFC or CLL-CFC with melphalan and a source of protein (fetal bovine serum or bovine serum albumin) resulted in decreased cell kill. Differences in in vitro sensitivity of normal and malignant lymphocyte CFC to steroids and cytotoxic agents can be demonstrated using these culture systems. CLL-CFC showed variable sensitivity to hydrocortisone, and much greater sensitivity to antimetabolites than normal T-CFC. Differences in conditions of drug exposure, such as concurrent exposure to lectin or inclusion of protein, may alter the in vitro sensitivity of lymphocyte CFC to some drugs.","['Taetle, R', 'To, D', 'Mendelsohn, J']","['Taetle R', 'To D', 'Mendelsohn J']",['eng'],['CA 23100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Progesterone/pharmacology', 'Rosette Formation', 'Steroids/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Testosterone/pharmacology']",1983/08/01 00:00,1983/08/01 00:01,['1983/08/01 00:00'],"['1983/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Aug;43(8):3553-8.,"['0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Steroids)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)']",,,,

Cleavage of 5'-dAdo by whole cells was dependent on the continuous removal of the product adenine, since uptake was greatly reduced in cells deficient in adenine phosphoribosyl transferase and 50 microM adenine strongly inhibited 5'-dAdo cleavage. The results are consistent with the view that 5'-dAdo is a substrate for 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase and that its use as a non-metabolizable substrate for the nucleoside transport measurements is limited to cells lacking this enzyme.","['Plagemann, P G', 'Wohlhueter, R M']","['Plagemann PG', 'Wohlhueter RM']",['eng'],['GM 24468/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase/metabolism', 'Adenosine Kinase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Deoxyadenosines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism', 'Ovary/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Time Factors']",1983/04/15 00:00,1983/04/15 00:01,['1983/04/15 00:00'],"['1983/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(83)90458-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(83)90458-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1983 Apr 15;32(8):1433-40. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(83)90458-6.,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', 'EC 2.4.2.7 (Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.20 (Adenosine Kinase)']",,,,

The leukemias are among the best studied malignant cells and they provide the largest body of relevant cytogenetic data. In chronic myeloid leukemia, a reasonably consistent translocation [t(9;22) (q34;q11)] is observed in 93 percent of all Ph1 positive patients. In the other patients, translocations are either two-way, involving No. 22 with some other chromosome or complex translocations involving Nos. 9 and 22 and another chromosome. In acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, two translocations are each specifically associated with leukemic cells arrested at two different stages of maturation. One of these, t(8;21)(q22;q22), is found mainly in patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia with maturation (AML-M2). The other, t(15;17)(q22?;q21?), is seen only in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL-M3). Various translocations have been observed in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or in Burkitt lymphoma. The most common is t(8;14)(q24;q32), but variants of this, namely t(2;8)(p13?;q24) and t(8;22)(q24;q11), have also been observed; in all of these, the consistent change involves 8q24. The various immunoglobulin loci are located on chromosomes 2, 14, and 22 in the same chromosome band affected by the translocations in B-cell leukemia. These translocations may occur randomly. If a specific translocation provides a particular cell type with a growth advantage, then selection could act to cause the proliferation of this aneuploid cell line vis-a-vis cells with a normal karyotype. In this view, the chromosome change could be the fundamental event leading to the leukemic transformation of an otherwise normal cell. The challenge for the future is to define the genes located at the sites of consistent translocations in myeloid leukemias and to determine the alterations in gene function that are associated with the translocation.","['Rowley, J D']",['Rowley JD'],['eng'],"['CA-16910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-19266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23954/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, 13-15', 'Chromosomes, Human, 16-18', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 1983 Mar-Apr;13(2):87-94.,,,,,

In this article we summarize experimental evidence suggesting that LGL represent the effectors of spontaneous cell mediated cytotoxicity responses in normal as well as in diseased states. This conclusion is based on two main findings: 1. the frequency of LGL correlates with the capacity to mediated spontaneous cell mediated cytotoxicity when pooled data of normal controls were analyzed, as well as when different density fractions or organs from one and the same individual were compared. 2. disease associated reduction in the numbers of LGL is invariably accompanied by an impaired spontaneous cytotoxicity.

MOLT-4 cells were more radiosensitive (D0 = 0.50 Gy) than FELC (D0 = 0.65 Gy) and V79 cells (D0 = 1.43 Gy).

In addition, the MOLT-4 cells showed a single-heat inactivation energy between 41.0 and 45.0 degrees C, while FELC and V79 cells both showed a transition in the inactivation energy at about 43.0 and 43.5 degrees C, respectively. These differences may be related to the fact that the upper temperature limit for the development of thermal tolerance during continuous heating was lower for MOLT-4 cells than for FELC or V79 cells. Killing of FELC and V79 cells was dependent on the sequence in which heat and X rays were applied, but the greatest effect was obtained when both treatments were given simultaneously.

Two nucleated cell lines, Molt 4 and U937, derived from human T lymphocytes and histiocytes, respectively, were employed as targets. The antibody-sensitized cells were used to develop the titration curves, measuring cell death as a function of limiting quantities of human C6 or C5,6 complex in the presence of an excess of other complement components. The cytolysis curves generated in both experiments were sigmoidal, in sharp contrast to the monotonic curves observed in lysis of erythrocytes treated similarly. The sigmoidal curves of cytolysis indicate a cooperative action of several molecules of C6 or acid-activated C5,6 complex, C(56)a. In contrast to the multi-hit characteristics of cytolysis, dose-response measurements of the release of 86Rb indicated that only one effective molecule of C6 per cell is required for assembly of a 86Rb-releasing channel. This divergence indicates that lysis requires formation of several channels or, alternatively, assembly of large channels that are formed by several molecules of C6. Because prior studies with erythrocyte ghosts have shown that only a single effective molecule of C6 is required for assembly of a transmembrane channel, regardless of size, we prefer to interpret the multi-hit characteristics of nucleated cell lysis as an indication of a multi-channel requirement, rather than channel enlargement.","['Koski, C L', 'Ramm, L E', 'Hammer, C H', 'Mayer, M M', 'Shin, M L']","['Koski CL', 'Ramm LE', 'Hammer CH', 'Mayer MM', 'Shin ML']",['eng'],"['R01 AI02566/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 DE06260/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*physiology', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Erythrocytes/physiology', 'Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1983/06/01 00:00,1983/06/01 00:01,['1983/06/01 00:00'],"['1983/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.80.12.3816 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1983 Jun;80(12):3816-20. doi: 10.1073/pnas.80.12.3816.,['9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)'],PMC394143,,,

Successful induction of in vitro differentiation in all three of the cases allowed the identification of a sequence of events whereby cells initially containing isolated mu heavy chains in their cytoplasm, on commencing light chain synthesis, begin to express stable SmIgM while surplus light chain is secreted without any association with the heavy chain. Although this is followed ultimately by the secretion of intact Ig effector molecules, the export of surplus light chains is apparently maintained throughout the developmental sequence.

Isolated T cells expressed both isoenzymes and, therefore, were apparently not involved in the leukemic process. This report presents results of a functional analysis of the patient's T cells. Cutaneous anergy to a battery of skin tests was correlated with abnormal proliferative responses of isolated T cells to phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A. The addition of sufficient numbers of autologous adherent cells restored mitogen responses to nearly normal levels. However, the patient's T cells failed to provide help for differentiation of allogeneic B cells in response to pokeweed mitogen. These data suggest that altered cellular immunity in CLL is not necessarily due to intrinsic T cell abnormalities.

After developing resistance to dCF, he responded to treatment with the combination of dCF and 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (ara-A). We monitored the levels in plasma and urine of adenosine, 2'-deoxyadenosine, and ara-A as well as the accumulation of their nucleotide derivatives in erythrocytes and circulating lymphoblasts. We also monitored the activities of adenosine deaminase and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase and the concentrations of AdoHcy and S-adenosylmethionine in lymphoblasts. Production of 2'-deoxyadenosine was related to both the duration of dCF infusion and the magnitude of cytolysis that occurred during treatment: much more 2'-deoxyadenosine was produced by dCF infusion when disease was active than by the same infusion given during remission. Resistance to dCF was associated with a decrease of greater than 90% in the amount of deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate accumulated by circulating lymphoblasts. Infusion of dCF resulted in increases of up to 20-fold in the concentration of AdoHcy in circulating lymphoblasts, causing a decrease in the S-adenosylmethionine:AdoHcy ratio (the ""methylation index"") from a pretreatment value of greater than 40:1 to less than 4:1. This ratio decreased to 2.5:1 during combined treatment with dCF and ara-A, which caused nearly complete inactivation of lymphoblast AdoHcy hydrolase. Decline in the methylation index was accompanied by inhibition of the methylation of newly synthesized lymphoblast RNA. Impaired ability to catabolize AdoHcy may have contributed to the cytolytic responses to dCF and ara-A, as well as to hepatic and central nervous system toxicity associated with their combined use.","['Hershfield, M S', 'Kredich, N M', 'Koller, C A', 'Mitchell, B S', 'Kurtzberg, J', 'Kinney, T R', 'Falletta, J M']","['Hershfield MS', 'Kredich NM', 'Koller CA', 'Mitchell BS', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Kinney TR', 'Falletta JM']",['eng'],"['AM 00434/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 20902/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenosine/blood/urine', 'Adult', 'Coformycin/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Deoxyadenosines/blood/urine', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Erythrocytes/analysis', 'Homocysteine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*drug therapy/urine', 'Lymphocytes/analysis/enzymology', 'Male', 'Pentostatin', 'Ribonucleosides/*administration & dosage', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Vidarabine/*administration & dosage/blood/urine']",1983/07/01 00:00,1983/07/01 00:01,['1983/07/01 00:00'],"['1983/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Jul;43(7):3451-8.,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,,,

This apparent paradox has been investigated by cell culture techniques and results quantified by cell number. In an in vitro model of high dose MTX therapy followed by leucovorin rescue (HD-MTX-LCR) there was survival of both melanoma and choriocarcinoma cell lines but not of an acute lymphocytic leukaemia cell line. The 70H metabolite of MTX was identified by HPLC in plasma samples of melanoma patients treated by HD-MTX-LCR, in which MTX concentrations approximately 10(-5) M were maintained for 24 h. However, metabolism per se is unlikely to account for the lack of response to MTX clinically. In vitro 70H MTX (10(-7) - 10(-6) M) was two orders of magnitude less cytotoxic for melanoma than MTX (10(-9) - 10(-8) M). The cellular accumulation of [3H]-MTX, using a rapid gradient centrifuge technique for separation of melanoma cells from medium, was reduced in the presence of 70H-MTX.

Uncultured CTL and clones CTLL-A2 and CTLL-A11 were derived from the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6 mice immunized against the H-2Dd determinants on the BALB/c sarcoma Meth A. Clone CTLL-R5 was derived from spleen of (BALB/c X C57BL)F1 mice immunized against a unique determinant on the BALB/c radiation-induced leukemia RL male 1. The cell-surface phenotype of the clones is Lyt-1+,2+,3+. Cytotoxic activity of CTLL-A2 and CTLL-R5 as determined by a 4-hr 51Cr-release assay was inhibited over 50% by 1 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose. CTLL-A11 and the uncultured cytotoxic T cells were more resistant to inhibition by 2DG (40% at 20 mM). Surprisingly, it was found that the addition of D-mannose, D-galactose, D-glucose, L-fucose, alpha-methyl-D-mannose, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine also inhibited, in a dose-related manner, the cytotoxicity of CTLL-A2 and CTLL-A11. CTLL-R5 showed a more restricted inhibition pattern: only D-mannose and D-galactose were inhibitory. The mechanism of inhibition remains to be clarified.","['Palladino, M A', 'Lattime, E C', 'Pecoraro, G A', 'Stutman, O', 'Oettgen, H F']","['Palladino MA', 'Lattime EC', 'Pecoraro GA', 'Stutman O', 'Oettgen HF']",['eng'],"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25932/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Mannose/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Monosaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(83)90371-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(83)90371-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1983 Mar;76(2):286-94. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(83)90371-4.,"['0 (Monosaccharides)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",,,,

Melanoma cells and autologous lymphoid cells were grown in tissue culture. Cellular immunoadsorbents were prepared by coupling formalin-treated melanoma and lymphoid cells to diethylaminoethyl cellulose. Rabbits were immunized with melanoma cells and antisera were passed sequentially through immunoadsorbents made of fetal bovine serum, and lymphoid cells. Unbound effluents were then passed through an immunoadsorbent prepared with melanoma cells. Antibodies binding to melanoma cells were eluted and their reactivity to melanoma-derived antigens was tested using a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. Antigens for this assay were NP-40 lysates of melanoma and lymphoid cells and fetal bovine serum. Radioactive Staphylococcal protein A was used to detect binding by the antibodies to the test antigens. The effects of formalin-fixation and storage of melanoma and lymphoid cells were studied. Storage of fixed melanoma cells for periods up to 4 months did not affect their capacity to bind antibodies. A single exposure of formalin-fixed cells to a low-pH elution buffer which was followed by neutralization did not affect binding by these cells. Antibodies isolated in this manner were of the IgG class and reacted with antigens derived from melanoma cells but not from autologous lymphocytes or fetal bovine serum. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using cellular immunoadsorbents to prepare xenogeneic polyclonal antibodies with a high degree of reactivity to antigens derived from human melanoma cells.","['Kelleher, P J', 'Mathews, H L', 'Moore, G E', 'Minden, P']","['Kelleher PJ', 'Mathews HL', 'Moore GE', 'Minden P']",['eng'],"['AI-00048/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/*isolation & purification', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*isolation & purification', 'Antigens, Surface/*isolation & purification', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Melanoma/*immunology', 'Melanoma-Specific Antigens', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*isolation & purification', 'Rabbits/immunology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00205359 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1983;14(3):191-5. doi: 10.1007/BF00205359.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Melanoma-Specific Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,,

Clinicopathological studies based on the Japanese classification of malignant lymphoma.,71-88,"Ninety cases of node-based non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in northwestern Kyushu, Japan were classified according to the Japanese Lymphoma Study Group (LSG) and the immunological as well as clinicopathological studies were performed. There were 6 cases of small cell type, 23 of medium-sized cell type, 25 of large cell type, 20 of pleomorphic type, 10 of lymphoblastic type and 6 cases of specific lymphomatous lesions (Lennert's lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma with angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy-like pattern). Immunologically, the T-cell character was predominant in pleomorphic type (100%), specific lymphomatous lesions (100%), medium-sized cell type (80%) and large cell type (60%). Clinically, leukemic manifestation was frequently encountered in all histological types except for large cell type. The leukemic cells in pleomorphic type and T-medium-sized cell type were polymorphic, similar to those of adult T-cell leukemia. Skin lesions were found chiefly in leukemic cases of pleomorphic and T-medium-sized cell types, and non-leukemic cases of T-large cell type. The worst prognosis was observed in the pleomorphic type, especially of leukemic form. These results support the proposal of pleomorphic type as a distinct entity in prospecting the immunological subtype, clinical manifestations, and survival. In addition, T-medium-sized cell and pleomorphic types, having common clinicopathological characteristics, may be categorized as one group. On the other hand, T-large cell type seems to be composed of heterogenous groups of the peripheral T-cell tumor, although some cases overlap with pleomorphic type.","['Mitsui, T', 'Kikuchi, M', 'Eimoto, T', 'Nishiuchi, M', 'Toyooka, R']","['Mitsui T', 'Kikuchi M', 'Eimoto T', 'Nishiuchi M', 'Toyooka R']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Acta Pathol Jpn,Acta pathologica japonica,0372637,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/complications', 'Japan', 'Leukemoid Reaction/complications', 'Lymphoma/classification/complications/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.1983.tb02101.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Pathol Jpn. 1983 Jan;33(1):71-88. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.1983.tb02101.x.,,,,,

Skin invasion by malignant T-cells was angiocentric and produced vessel wall destruction, resulting in necrotic cutaneous tumor nodules.

However, by electron microscopy, intracellular type C viral particles were seen in skin-infiltrating T cells. Peripheral blood malignant cells after 7 days in culture with T-cell growth factor-supplemented media expressed p19 antigen, and type C virus particles were seen by electron microscopy to be budding from malignant T lymphocytes. Mitomycin-C-treated peripheral-blood T cells induced the transformation of cord blood T cells into HTLV-infected p19+ T cells. The demonstration of HTLV in malignant T cells from our patient confirms the association of HTLV with Japanese adult T-cell leukemia.

The in vitro-labeled 85,000-dalton phosphoprotein comigrated on NaDodSO(4)/polyacrylamide gels with authentic phosphorylated P85(gag-mos). Immunoprecipitates obtained with antisera prepared against Rauscher murine leukemia virus core protein p30 were active in the immune complex kinase assay but anti-murine leukemia virus p10 precipitates were not. Previous studies have shown that anti-p30 but not anti-p10 antisera recognize P85(gag-mos). The 6m2 clone has been shown to express P85(gag-mos) at 33 degrees C but not at 39 degrees C. Anti-p30 immune complexes from 6m2 cells maintained at 39 degrees C failed to phosphorylate the 85,000-dalton protein. Furthermore, the in vitro phosphorylated 85,000-dalton protein gave the same pattern of V8 protease-generated cleavage products as in vivo(32)P-labeled P85(gag-mos). We conclude from these results that P85(gag-mos) is phosphorylated in anti-p30 immune complex kinase reactions. Phosphoamino acid analyses indicated that the in vitro phosphorylated P85(gag-mos) contained phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Our findings indicate that incubation of anti-p30 immunoprecipitates at 39 degrees C drastically reduced, in a specific way, the kinase activity associated with P85(gag-mos). This result and other data suggest that the kinase is virus-encoded. Because P85(gag-mos), but not Pr65(gag) is phosphorylated in anti-p30 immunoprecipitates from MuLV-MuSV ts110 producer cells, the kinase enzyme is associated with P85(gag-mos) and not gag gene products. A second major polypeptide of the size of P58(gag) was also phosphorylated in anti-p30 immunoprecipitates from cells maintained at 33 degrees C but not at 39 degrees C. Since 6m2 cells at 39 degrees C contain P58(gag), this is also consistent with the kinase activity being associated with P85(gag-mos).","['Kloetzer, W S', 'Maxwell, S A', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Kloetzer WS', 'Maxwell SA', 'Arlinghaus RB']",['eng'],"['CA-06427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25465/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, gag', '*Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Immune Sera', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology/*genetics', 'Protein Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Temperature', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.80.2.412 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1983 Jan;80(2):412-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.80.2.412.,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",PMC393387,,,
