T cell immunoglobulin and mucine domain (TIM)-3 is a specific surface marker for LSCs and is highly expressed on LSCs compared with normal bone marrow cells, haematopoietic stem cells. Studies have indicated that microRNAs can affect AML progression through targeting different genes expressions like TIM-3. So, based on bioinformatics assessments, we predicted that miR-330-5p may highly inhibit TIM-3 expression. The purpose of the present study was to prove the silencing effect of miR-330-5p on TIM-3 gene expression in AML cell line (HL-60) in vitro. METHODS: HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplied with 10% FBS. TIM-3 expression was induced in the cells using phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The cells were transfected with miR-330-5p and then, the gene and protein expression of TIM-3 were measured using q-RT-PCR and flow-cytometry methods, respectively. RESULTS: The results of our bioinformatics surveys revealed that miR-330-5p has high predicted ability to silence TIM-3 gene expression. Accordingly, our experiments confirmed that miR-330-5p is able to strongly silence TIM-3 expression (98.15% silencing) in HL-60 cell line (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: According to our results, miR-330-5p has a strong inhibitory effect on TIM-3 expression in AML cell line. Thus, the bioinformatics prediction of Mirwalk and Target Scan softwares for silencing effect of miR-330-5p on TIM-3 is confirmed.","['Fooladinezhad, Haniyeh', 'Khanahmad, Hossein', 'Ganjalikhani-Hakemi, Mazdak', 'Doosti, Abbas']","['Fooladinezhad H', 'Khanahmad H', 'Ganjalikhani-Hakemi M', 'Doosti A']","['a Department of Genetics, Faculty of Sciences, Shahrekord Branch , Islamic Azad University , Shahrekord , Iran.', 'b Department of Genetics, Faculty of Medicine , Isfahan University of Medical Sciences , Isfahan , Iran.', 'c Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine , Isfahan University of Medical Sciences , Isfahan , Iran .', 'a Department of Genetics, Faculty of Sciences, Shahrekord Branch , Islamic Azad University , Shahrekord , Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160624,England,Br J Biomed Sci,British journal of biomedical science,9309208,"['0 (HAVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)', '0 (MIRN330 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'HL-60', 'TIM-3', 'miR-330-5p', 'molecular medicine']",2016/06/25 06:00,2017/01/14 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09674845.2016.1194564 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Biomed Sci. 2016 Jul;73(3):129-133. doi: 10.1080/09674845.2016.1194564.

We analyzed the immunophenotype and function of natural killer (NK) cells in blood of AML patients treated after chemotherapy with HDC plus IL-2. The treatment caused a striking expansion of CD56brightCD16neg and CD56brightCD16low NK cell subpopulations. A reduced NK cell fraction recovered and high proportions of cells expressed the activating receptors NKG2D, NKp30, and NKp46. Concomitantly, KIR-expressing NK cells were reduced and NK cells with inhibitory NKG2A/CD94 receptors increased beyond normal levels. In addition, the immunotherapy-induced NK cells exhibited high capacity to produce IFN-gamma and to degranulate. Furthermore, we provide evidence from subsequent in vitro studies that this is caused in part by direct effects of IL-2 on the CD56bright cells. IL-2 specifically induced proliferation of both CD56bright subpopulations, but not of CD56dim cells. It further preserved the expression of activating receptors and the capacity to produce IFN-gamma and to degranulate. These data suggest that therapy with HDC plus IL-2 supports the reconstitution of a deficient NK cell fraction through the specific amplification of CD56bright NK cells giving rise to a functional NK cell compartment with high potential to combat leukemic disease.","['Cuapio, Angelica', 'Post, Mirte', 'Cerny-Reiterer, Sabine', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Stefanzl, Gabriele', 'Basilio, Jose', 'Herndlhofer, Susanne', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Brons, Nicolaas H C', 'Casanova, Emilio', 'Zimmer, Jacques', 'Valent, Peter', 'Hofer, Erhard']","['Cuapio A', 'Post M', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Gleixner KV', 'Stefanzl G', 'Basilio J', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Sperr WR', 'Brons NH', 'Casanova E', 'Zimmer J', 'Valent P', 'Hofer E']","['Department of Vascular Biology and Thrombosis Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Vascular Biology and Thrombosis Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Vascular Biology and Thrombosis Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'National Core Facility Cytometry, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology, Center of Physiology and Pharmacology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Infection and Immunity, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Vascular Biology and Thrombosis Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Histamine/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/methods', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD56bright', 'CD56dim', 'IL-2', 'histamine', 'natural killer cells']",2016/06/25 06:00,2018/01/30 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2015/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10191 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10191 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 19;7(29):46466-46481. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10191.,10.18632/oncotarget.10191 [doi],['P 25599/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],PMC5216810,"['Research grants for unrelated work within the last three years were received by', 'P.V. from Novartis and Ariad and by W.R.S. from Meda and Thermo Fisher.

In the present study, we identified that MM1, a c-Myc inhibitor, specifically binds to C-termini of p63alpha (including DeltaNp63alpha and TAp63alpha). Further study demonstrates that p63alpha facilitates MM1 protein degradation via proteasomal pathway, resulting in elevation of c-Myc transactivation activity. Knockdown of DeltaNp63alpha leads to decrease in c-Myc protein levels, concomitant with reduced expression of CDK4 and Cyclin D1, and impaired cell cycle progression, both of which are effectively reversed by simultaneous knockdown of MM1. Moreover, expression of p63 and CDK4 is concomitantly up-regulated in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Together, this study reveals a novel crosstalk between p63 and c-Myc that may play an important role in cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis.","['Han, Anning', 'Li, Juan', 'Li, Yimin', 'Wang, Yang', 'Bergholz, Johann', 'Zhang, Yujun', 'Li, Chenghua', 'Xiao, Zhi-Xiong']","['Han A', 'Li J', 'Li Y', 'Wang Y', 'Bergholz J', 'Zhang Y', 'Li C', 'Xiao ZhX']","['Center of Growth, Metabolism and Aging, Key Laboratory of Biological Resources and Ecological Environment of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.', 'Center of Growth, Metabolism and Aging, Key Laboratory of Biological Resources and Ecological Environment of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.', 'Center of Growth, Metabolism and Aging, Key Laboratory of Biological Resources and Ecological Environment of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.', 'Center of Growth, Metabolism and Aging, Key Laboratory of Biological Resources and Ecological Environment of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.', 'Center of Growth, Metabolism and Aging, Key Laboratory of Biological Resources and Ecological Environment of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.', 'Center of Growth, Metabolism and Aging, Key Laboratory of Biological Resources and Ecological Environment of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.', 'Center of Growth, Metabolism and Aging, Key Laboratory of Biological Resources and Ecological Environment of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.', 'Center of Growth, Metabolism and Aging, Key Laboratory of Biological Resources and Ecological Environment of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (TP63 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['MM1', 'c-Myc', 'cell cycle', 'p63', 'protein stability']",2016/06/25 06:00,2018/02/28 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2016/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10187 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10187 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 12;7(28):44277-44287. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10187.,10.18632/oncotarget.10187 [doi],,PMC5190095,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest to this work'],['Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 13;8(24):39935.

They are broadly divided into 3 subgroups: HIV-related, posttransplant, and congenital immunodeficiency. Subsequent to organ transplantation and acquired immunosuppression, a few cases of EBV-associated SMTs have been described in the liver, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal system. To the authors' knowledge, intracranial involvement after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation has never been reported previously. The authors describe the case of a 65-year-old woman who presented with recent-onset painful ophthalmoplegia. She had a prior history of acute myelogenous leukemia requiring allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation 2 years earlier, but she was in a remission phase. Imaging revealed a T1/T2 isointense, homogeneously enhancing lesion of the left cavernous sinus. A presumptive diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome was made, and she was treated with steroids; however, her symptoms progressed quickly and repeat imaging revealed that the lesion was growing. To rule out leukemic deposits, a minimally invasive lateral orbitotomy extradural transcavernous approach was performed for biopsy sampling and debulking of the lesion. The biopsied tumor tissue was found to be infiltrative, grayish, firm, and moderately vascular. The final pathology results indicated an EBV-associated SMT of the cavernous sinus. Subsequently, the patient's steroid treatment was stopped and she had obtained partial symptomatic relief at her last follow-up visit, 3 months after surgery. EBV-associated SMT should be included in the differential diagnosis for intracranial and dural-based central nervous system lesions, especially in immunocompromised patients. Paradoxical response to steroids with worsening of symptoms is a hallmark of EBV-associated SMTs.","['Raheja, Amol', 'Sowder, Aleksandra', 'Palmer, Cheryl', 'Rodriguez, Fausto J', 'Couldwell, William T']","['Raheja A', 'Sowder A', 'Palmer C', 'Rodriguez FJ', 'Couldwell WT']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Clinical Neurosciences Center, and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah; and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah; and.', 'Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Clinical Neurosciences Center, and.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160624,United States,J Neurosurg,Journal of neurosurgery,0253357,,IM,"['Aged', '*Cavernous Sinus', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications/pathology', 'Female', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Smooth Muscle Tumor/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Vascular Neoplasms/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['EBER = EBV-encoded small RNA', 'EBV = Epstein-Barr virus', 'EBV-associated smooth muscle tumor', 'Epstein-Barr virus', 'ICA = internal carotid artery', 'LOET = lateral orbitotomy extradural transcavernous', 'PT-SMT = posttransplantation SMT', 'SMA = smooth muscle actin', 'SMT = smooth muscle tumor', 'THS = Tolosa-Hunt syndrome', 'cavernous sinus', 'lateral orbitotomy extradural transcavernous approach', 'minimally invasive biopsy', 'oncology', 'peripheral blood stem cell transplantation']",2016/06/25 06:00,2019/09/05 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3171/2016.4.JNS16290 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosurg. 2017 May;126(5):1479-1483. doi: 10.3171/2016.4.JNS16290.

In aggressive ATL, the response to chemotherapy is extremely poor. We hypothesized that this poor response is due to the existence of chemotherapy-resistant cells, such as leukemic stem cells. Previously, we successfully identified an ATL stem cell (ATLSC) candidate as the c-kit+/CD38-/CD71- cells in an ATL mouse model using Tax transgenic mice. Here, with a new ATL mouse model using HBZ-transgenic mice, we further discovered that the functional ATLSC candidate, which commonly expresses c-kit, is drug-resistant and has the ability to initiate tumors and reconstitute lymphomatous cells. We characterized the ATLSCs as c-kit+/CD4-/CD8- cells and found that they have a similar gene expression profile as T cell progenitors. Additionally, we found that AP-1 gene family members, including Junb, Jund, and Fosb, were up-regulated in the ATLSC fraction. The results of an in vitro assay showed that ATLSCs cultured with cytokines known to promote stem cell expansion, such as stem cell factor (SCF), showed highly proliferative activity and maintained their stem cell fraction. Inhibition of c-kit-SCF signaling with the neutralizing antibody ACK2 affected ATLSC self-renewal and proliferation.

However, around 30% of patients still experience biochemical recurrence after radiation therapy within 10 years. Thus, identification of better biomarkers and new targets are urgently required to improve current therapeutic strategies. The miR-99 family has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of the DNA damage response, via targeting of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factors, SMARCA5 and SMARCD1 in cell line models. In the present study, we have demonstrated that low expression of miR-99a and miR-100 is present in cell populations which are relatively radiation insensitive, for example in prostate cancer stem cells and in castration-resistant prostate cancer. Additionally, treatment of cells with the synthetic glucocorticoid, Dexamethasone resulted in decreased miR-99a and 100 expression, suggesting a new mechanism of miR-99a and 100 regulation in androgen-independent prostate cells. Strikingly, treatment of prostate cells with the glucocorticoid receptor inhibitor, Mifepristone was found to sensitize prostate cells to radiation by increasing the levels of miR-99a and miR-100. These results qualify the miR99 family as markers of radiation sensitivity and as potential therapeutic targets to improve efficiency of radiotherapy.","['Rane, Jayant K', 'Erb, Holger H H', 'Nappo, Giovanna', 'Mann, Vincent M', 'Simms, Matthew S', 'Collins, Anne T', 'Visakorpi, Tapio', 'Maitland, Norman J']","['Rane JK', 'Erb HH', 'Nappo G', 'Mann VM', 'Simms MS', 'Collins AT', 'Visakorpi T', 'Maitland NJ']","['The Cancer Research Unit, Department of Biology, University of York, York, North Yorkshire, YO10 5DD, UK.', ""Leukaemia and Stem Cell Biology Group, Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College London, Rayne Institute, London, SE5 9NU, UK."", 'The Cancer Research Unit, Department of Biology, University of York, York, North Yorkshire, YO10 5DD, UK.', 'The Cancer Research Unit, Department of Biology, University of York, York, North Yorkshire, YO10 5DD, UK.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Haematopoiesis and Stem Cell Biology, Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Hull York Medical School, University of Hull, Hull, East Yorkshire, HU6 7RX, UK.', 'Department of Urology, Castle Hill Hospital, Cottingham, East Yorkshire, HU16 5JQ, UK.', 'Hull York Medical School, University of Hull, Hull, East Yorkshire, HU6 7RX, UK.', 'Department of Urology, Castle Hill Hospital, Cottingham, East Yorkshire, HU16 5JQ, UK.', 'The Cancer Research Unit, Department of Biology, University of York, York, North Yorkshire, YO10 5DD, UK.', 'Prostate Cancer Research Center, Institute of Biosciences and Medical Technology - BioMediTech, University of Tampere and Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, 33520 Finland.', 'The Cancer Research Unit, Department of Biology, University of York, York, North Yorkshire, YO10 5DD, UK.', 'Hull York Medical School, University of Hull, Hull, East Yorkshire, HU6 7RX, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Hormone Antagonists)', '0 (MIRN100 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN99 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Hormone Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Mifepristone/pharmacology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Radiation Tolerance/*genetics', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*antagonists & inhibitors']",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage repair', 'cancer stem cells', 'miRNA', 'mifepristone', 'radiotherapy']",2016/06/25 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2016/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10207 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10207 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 9;7(32):51965-51980. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10207.,10.18632/oncotarget.10207 [doi],,PMC5239528,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This encompasses AML with MLL1 gene translocations, because Mll1-fusion proteins aberrantly activate HOX transcription. We previously identified FGF2 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2) as a target gene for HoxA9 and HoxA10 that was indirectly activated by Mll-Ell (an Mll1-fusion protein). Autocrine stimulation of Mll-Ell+ myeloid progenitor cells by Fgf2 stabilized betacatenin and increased expression of betacatenin target genes, including CDX4. Since HOXA9 and HOXA10 are Cdx4 target genes, Fgf2 indirectly augmented direct effects of Mll-Ell on these genes. ITGB3, encoding beta3 integrin, is another HoxA10 target gene. In the current studies, we found activation of ITGB3 transcription in Mll-Ell+ myeloid progenitor cells via HoxA9 and HoxA10. Increased expression of alphavbeta3 integrin increased Syk-activation; contributing to cytokine hypersensitivity. However, inhibiting Fgf-R partly reversed alphavbeta3 activity in Mll-Ell+ progenitor cells by decreasing ITGB3 promoter activity in a betacatenin- and Cdx4-dependent manner. Inhibitors of Fgf-R or Syk impaired proliferation of CD34+ bone marrow cells from AML subjects with increased Hox-expression; with a greater combined effect. These studies identified a rational therapeutic approach to this AML subtype.","['Shah, Chirag A', 'Bei, Ling', 'Wang, Hao', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Platanias, Leonidas C', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Shah CA', 'Bei L', 'Wang H', 'Altman JK', 'Platanias LC', 'Eklund EA']","['The Feinberg School of Medicine and Robert H.

BQ has not been comprehensively assessed for its impact on genome maintenance, limiting our understanding of the true health risks associated with benzene exposure and our ability to identify people with increased sensitivity to this genotoxin. Here we analyze the impact BQ exposure has on wild type and DNA repair-defective mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and wild type human cells. We find that double strand break (DSB) repair and replication fork maintenance pathways including homologous recombination (HR) and Fanconi anemia (FA) suppress BQ toxicity. BQ-induced damage efficiently stalls replication forks, yet poorly induces ATR/DNA-PKCS responses. Furthermore, the pattern of BQ-induced gammaH2AX and 53BP1foci is consistent with the formation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)-stabilized regressed replication forks. At a biochemical level, BQ inhibited topoisomerase 1 (topo1)-mediated DNA ligation and nicking in vitro; thus providing mechanism for the cellular phenotype. These data are consistent with a model that proposes BQ interferes with type I topoisomerase's ability to maintain replication fork restart and progression leading to chromosomal instability that has the potential to cause hematopoietic cancers like MDS and AML.","['Son, Mi Young', 'Deng, Chu-Xia', 'Hoeijmarkers, Jan H', 'Rebel, Vivienne I', 'Hasty, Paul']","['Son MY', 'Deng CX', 'Hoeijmarkers JH', 'Rebel VI', 'Hasty P']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Institute of Biotechnology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, Macau SAR, China.', 'Department of Genetics, Cancer Genomics Netherlands, Erasmus MC, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Cellular and Structural Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', 'The Cancer Therapy Research Center, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', 'The Barshop Center of Aging, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Center, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA."", 'Current address: BioAffinity, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Institute of Biotechnology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', 'The Cancer Therapy Research Center, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.', 'The Barshop Center of Aging, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoquinones/*toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/*toxicity']",['NOTNLM'],"['Fanconi anemia', 'double strand break repair', 'replication fork maintenance', 'type 1 topoisomerase']",2016/06/25 06:00,2018/01/30 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2016/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10184 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10184 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 19;7(29):46433-46447. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10184.,10.18632/oncotarget.10184 [doi],"['P01 AG017242/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES022054/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5216808,['The authors have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Impaired expression of beta-globin reduces adult hemoglobin (alpha2beta2) production, the hallmark of beta-thalassemia. A single-base mutation at codon 6 leads to formation of HbS (alpha2beta(S)2) and sickle cell disease. While the basis of these diseases is known, therapy remains largely supportive. Bone marrow transplantation is the only curative therapy. Patients with elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, alpha2gamma2) as adults exhibit reduced symptoms and enhanced survival. The beta-globin gene locus is a paradigm of cell- and developmental stage-specific regulation. Although the principal erythroid cell transcription factors are known, mechanisms responsible for silencing of the gamma-globin gene were obscure until application of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we review findings in the field. GWAS identified BCL11A as a candidate negative regulator of gamma-globin expression. Subsequent studies have established BCL11A as a quantitative repressor. GWAS-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms lie within an essential erythroid enhancer of the BCL11A gene. Disruption of a discrete region within the enhancer reduces BCL11A expression and induces HbF expression, providing the basis for gene therapy using gene editing tools. A recently identified, second silencing factor, leukemia/lymphoma-related factor/Pokemon, shares features with BCL11A, including interaction with the nucleosome remodeling deacetylase repressive complex. These findings suggest involvement of a common pathway for HbF silencing. In addition, we discuss other factors that may be involved in gamma-globin gene silencing and their potential manipulation for therapeutic benefit in treating the beta-hemoglobinopathies.","['Smith, Elenoe C', 'Orkin, Stuart H']","['Smith EC', 'Orkin SH']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA stuart_orkin@dfci.harvard.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20160623,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (BCL11A protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (gamma-Globins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*genetics', '*Gene Editing', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins', 'gamma-Globins/*genetics']",,,2016/06/25 06:00,2018/09/18 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2016/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ddw170 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddw170 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2016 Oct 1;25(R2):R99-R105. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddw170.

Here, we determined that Tyr-33-phosphorylated WWOX physically binds non-phosphorylated ERK and IkappaBalpha in immature acute lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 T cells and in the naive mouse spleen. The IkappaBalpha.ERK.WWOX complex was shown to localize, in part, in the mitochondria. WWOX prevents IkappaBalpha from proteasomal degradation. Upon stimulating MOLT-4 with ionophore A23187/phorbol myristate acetate, endogenous IkappaBalpha and ERK undergo rapid phosphorylation in <5 min, and subsequently WWOX is Tyr-33 and Tyr-287 de-phosphorylated and Ser-14 phosphorylated. Three hours later, IkappaBalpha starts to degrade, and ERK returns to basal or non-phosphorylation, and this lasts for the next 12 h. Finally, expression of CD3 and CD8 occurs in MOLT-4 along with reappearance of the IkappaBalpha.ERK.WWOX complex near 24 h. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by U0126 or IkappaBalpha degradation by MG132 prevents MOLT-4 maturation. By time-lapse FRET microscopy, IkappaBalpha.ERK.WWOX complex exhibits an increased binding strength by 1-2-fold after exposure to ionophore A23187/phorbol myristate acetate for 15-24 h. Meanwhile, a portion of ERK and WWOX relocates to the nucleus, suggesting their role in the induction of CD3 and CD8 expression in MOLT-4.","['Huang, Shenq-Shyang', 'Su, Wan-Pei', 'Lin, Hsin-Pin', 'Kuo, Hsiang-Ling', 'Wei, Hsiao-Ling', 'Chang, Nan-Shan']","['Huang SS', 'Su WP', 'Lin HP', 'Kuo HL', 'Wei HL', 'Chang NS']","['From the Institute of Molecular Medicine.', 'From the Institute of Molecular Medicine.', 'From the Institute of Molecular Medicine.', 'From the Institute of Molecular Medicine.', 'From the Institute of Molecular Medicine.', 'From the Institute of Molecular Medicine, Center of Infectious Disease and Signaling Research, and Advanced Optoelectronic Technology Center, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 70101, Taiwan, Republic of China, Department of Neurochemistry, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island, New York, New York 10314, Department of Neuroscience and Physiology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210, Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung 40402, Taiwan, Republic of China nschang13827@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20160623,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (WW Domain-Containing Oxidoreductase)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (WWOX protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Wwox protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects/genetics', 'Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Domains', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'WW Domain-Containing Oxidoreductase']",['NOTNLM'],"['*differentiation', '*extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)', '*lymphocyte', '*phorbol ester', '*phosphorylation', '*tumor suppressor gene']",2016/06/25 06:00,2017/05/04 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2016/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)33469-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.716167 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Aug 12;291(33):17319-31. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.716167.

They are considered as a unique biological entity in the 2008 World Health Organization Classification of Hematologic Neoplasm. Both entities are arbitrarily separated by a cut-off point of 20-25% of blast cells in the bone marrow. Treatment of LBL has evolved over time from conventional high-grade NHL schedules to ALL-derived protocols. The aim of this work is to report the clinical characteristics, overall survival (OS), event free survival (EFS), and common chemotherapy toxicities of lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) patients during a 5.5year period. Patients and methods A Retrospective review of patient's charts diagnosed and treated as LBL during the period between July 2007 and end of December 2012 was done. Patients were treated according to St. Jude Children Research Hospital ALL Total Therapy XV protocol, standard risk arm. Results This study included 77 patients. T-cell LBL patients were 67, while 10 were of B-cell origin. The median age at diagnosis was 9years (95% CI: 7-10). The majority were males 54/77. Stage III patients were 51, stage IV 13, stage II 11 and stage I 2 patients. Two patients were excluded from analysis as they died before receiving chemotherapy. Complete remission post induction chemotherapy was seen in 22 patients considered early responders, and partial remission in 55 considered late responders. With a median follow up duration of 47months (95% CI: 38-56), the 4year overall survival and event free survival were 86.45% (95% CI: 73.78-94.09) and 82.18% (95% CI: 69.25-90.61) respectively. Twelve patients died during the study period; 2 early deaths before starting chemotherapy from disease progression, 2 in CR due to chemotherapy related toxicity and 8 from disease progression. All the relapsed patients were T-cell, had advanced disease at presentation (6 with stage III; 2 with stage IV). Two patients (2.6%) had isolated local, BM, and CNS relapse each, while 1 (1.3%) had both local and CNS relapse. Disease recurrence was local in 3 patients (3.9%), and systemic in 5 (6.4%), while it was early in 6 (7.8%), and late in 2 (2.6%) patients. Median time to disease progression was 20months (range 5-39months). All relapsed patients did not survive salvage chemotherapy. The most common chemotherapy toxicities were cerebral venous thrombosis (20%), followed by bone infarcts (10.6%), and avascular necrosis (AVN) of head of femur (9.3%). One patient developed secondary acute myeloid leukemia after 3years of FU with unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities. Conclusion Results of treatment of LBL on the St Jude's total therapy XV study are comparable to most of the similar reported studies. Outcome of relapsing patients is extremely poor, hence there is a need to identify biologic or clinical prognostic factors including minimal residual tumor to better evaluate chemotherapy response. Steroid induced AVN, and cerebral vascular thrombosis were the main chemotherapeutic adverse events.","['Rahman Sayed, Hany Abdel', 'Sedky, Mohamed', 'Hamoda, Asmaa', 'Kinaaie, Naglaa El', 'Wakeel, Madeha El', 'Hesham, Dina']","['Rahman Sayed HA', 'Sedky M', 'Hamoda A', 'Kinaaie NE', 'Wakeel ME', 'Hesham D']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University and Children Cancer Hospital, Egypt.

We examined the use of peripheral blood as a less invasive means of MRD assessment at days 8 and 15 of induction therapy and established the cutoff level that would allow the most accurate prediction of BM MRD postinduction therapy. METHODS: MRD analysis was performed using 5-color flow cytometry on BM and PB samples from 77 B-ALL patients. BM MRD at diagnosis and day 29 of induction therapy was analyzed using the following antibody combinations: CD45-PC5/CD19-PC7/CD20-PE/CD10-ECD/CD38-FITC/CD13 + CD33-PE/CD10-ECD/CD34-FITC. PB MRD at days 8 and 15 was determined using CD45-PC5/CD19-PC7/CD20-ECD/CD10-PE/CD34-FITC. RESULTS: Day 8 and day 15 PB MRD levels were significantly higher in patients who had persistent BM MRD at day 29. PB MRD <0.01% at day 8 and/or day 15 predicted negative day 29 BM MRD status with 100% sensitivity but poor specificity. ROC curve analysis showed that day 15 PB MRD level of 0.1% yielded the highest sensitivity (78%) and specificity (82%). CONCLUSIONS: PB MRD cutoff level of 0.1% at day 15 has the best predictive value in determining positive day 29 BM MRD.,"['Setiadi, A', 'Owen, D', 'Tsang, A', 'Milner, R', 'Vercauteren, S']","['Setiadi A', 'Owen D', 'Tsang A', 'Milner R', 'Vercauteren S']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', ""Division of Hematopathology, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'Child & Family Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

For these patients, transfusion of cryopreserved autologous PLTs is an option, but is time- and resource-consuming. We aimed at further simplifying this process. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective single-center analysis was conducted on the transfusion of cryopreserved autologous PLTs in nine female alloimmunized, PLT transfusion-refractory patients treated for acute leukemia (n = 8) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 1). No additional processing was used before transfusion, and most notably, washing and centrifugation steps were omitted. Clinical efficacy and safety, as well as a flow cytometric assessment of structural and functional PLT changes, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 40 autologous PLT concentrates were thawed at bedside and transfused a median of 32 (range, 9 to 994) days after cryopreservation. No major bleeds and no severe dimethyl sulfoxide toxicity were observed. The median PLT count increments did not differ 1 and 18 to 24 hours after transfusion and reached 6 x 10(9) /L (interquartile range [IQR], 3 x 10(9) -7.5 x 10(9) /L) and 6 x 10(9) /L (IQR, 2.5 x 10(9) -9.5 x 10(9) /L), respectively. Cryopreservation resulted in partial activation of one-third of the PLTs. In vitro stimulation with strong agonists induced additional full activation of cryopreserved PLTs: median, 55% (IQR, 42%-60%) after thrombin and 39% (IQR, 36%-39%) after convulxin. CONCLUSION: The transfusion of cryopreserved autologous PLTs is feasible and safe. Despite the cryopreservation process, PLT functionality is partially maintained.","['Gerber, Bernhard', 'Alberio, Lorenzo', 'Rochat, Sophie', 'Stenner, Frank', 'Manz, Markus G', 'Buser, Andy', 'Schanz, Urs', 'Stussi, Georg']","['Gerber B', 'Alberio L', 'Rochat S', 'Stenner F', 'Manz MG', 'Buser A', 'Schanz U', 'Stussi G']","['Division of Hematology, University and University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. bernhard.gerber@usz.ch.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland. bernhard.gerber@usz.ch.', 'Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital and University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Service of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, CHUV, Lausanne University Hospital and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Hematology and Central Hematology Laboratory, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital and University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University and University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, University and University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160624,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Platelets/cytology/physiology', 'Cryopreservation/*methods/standards', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hemorrhage', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Safety', 'Platelet Activation/drug effects', 'Platelet Transfusion/*methods/standards', 'Plateletpheresis/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/06/25 06:00,2017/05/27 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2016/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.13690 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2016 Oct;56(10):2426-2437. doi: 10.1111/trf.13690.

The biological plausibility of FA-induced leukemia is controversial because few studies have reported FA-induced bone marrow (BM) toxicity, and none have reported BM stem/progenitor cell toxicity. We sought to comprehensively examine FA hematoxicity in vivo in mouse peripheral blood, BM, spleen and myeloid progenitors. We included the leukemogen and BM toxicant, benzene (BZ), as a positive control, separately and together with FA as co-exposure occurs frequently. We exposed BALB/c mice to 3 mg/m(3) FA in air for 2 weeks, mimicking occupational exposure, then measured complete blood counts, nucleated BM cell count, and myeloid progenitor colony formation. We also investigated potential mechanisms of FA toxicity, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, apoptosis, and hematopoietic growth factor and receptor levels. FA exposure significantly reduced nucleated BM cells and BM-derived colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E); down-regulated GM-CSFRalpha and EPOR expression; increased ROS in nucleated BM, spleen and CFU-GM cells; and increased apoptosis in nucleated spleen and CFU-GM cells. FA and BZ each similarly altered BM mature cells and stem/progenitor counts, BM and CFU-GM ROS, and apoptosis in spleen and CFU-GM but had differential effects on other end points. Co-exposure was more potent for several end points. Thus, FA is toxic to the mouse hematopoietic system, including BM stem/progenitor cells, and it enhances BZ-induced toxic effects. Our findings suggest that FA may induce BM toxicity by affecting myeloid progenitor growth and survival through oxidative damage and reduced expression levels of GM-CSFRalpha and EPOR.","['Wei, Chenxi', 'Wen, Huaxiao', 'Yuan, Langyue', 'McHale, Cliona M', 'Li, Hui', 'Wang, Kun', 'Yuan, Junlin', 'Yang, Xu', 'Zhang, Luoping']","['Wei C', 'Wen H', 'Yuan L', 'McHale CM', 'Li H', 'Wang K', 'Yuan J', 'Yang X', 'Zhang L']","['Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, College of Life Sciences, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, 430079, Hubei, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Ecological Safety Monitoring and Evaluation, College of Life Sciences, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, 410081, Hunan, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, College of Life Sciences, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, 430079, Hubei, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, College of Life Sciences, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, 430079, Hubei, China.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, College of Life Sciences, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, 430079, Hubei, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, College of Life Sciences, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, 430079, Hubei, China.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Department of Population Health, School of Medicine, New York University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, College of Life Sciences, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, 430079, Hubei, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Genetic Regulation and Integrative Biology, College of Life Sciences, Central China Normal University, Wuhan, 430079, Hubei, China. yangxu@mail.ccnu.edu.cn.', 'Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA. luoping@berkeley.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160623,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Formaldehyde/*toxicity', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Spleen/drug effects', 'Toxicity Tests/methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['Benzene', 'Bone marrow', 'Formaldehyde', 'Hematotoxicity', 'Myeloid progenitor']",2016/06/25 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2015/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00204-016-1760-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00204-016-1760-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2017 Feb;91(2):921-933. doi: 10.1007/s00204-016-1760-5.

While activation of NF-kappaB has been implicated in malignancies such as leukemia and lymphoma, loss-of-function mutations affecting different NF-kappaB pathway components have been shown to cause primary immunodeficiency disorders. Recently, haploinsufficiency of NF-kappaB1 has been described in three families with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied a patient with recurrent respiratory infections and bacterial parapharyngeal abscess. Immunological investigations revealed normal total B- cell numbers, but hypogammaglobulinemia, decreased frequencies of class-switched B cells and impaired T-cell proliferation. Targeted next-generation sequencing using a custom-designed panel comprising all known PID genes (IUIS 2014 classification) and novel candidate genes identified a novel heterozygous frameshift mutation in the NFKB1 gene leading to a premature stop codon (c.491delG; p.G165A*31). We could show that the mutation leads to reduced phosphorylation of p105 upon stimulation, resulting in decreased protein levels of p50. The further disease course was mainly characterized by two episodes of severe EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease responsive to rituximab treatment. Due to disease severity, the patient is considered for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Interestingly, the father carries the same heterozygous NFKB1 mutation and also shows decreased frequencies of memory B cells but has a much milder clinical phenotype, in line with a considerable phenotypic disease heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of NF-kappaB1 leads to immunodeficiency with a wider phenotypic spectrum of disease manifestation than previously appreciated, including EBV lymphoproliferative diseases as a hitherto unrecognized feature of the disease.","['Boztug, Heidrun', 'Hirschmugl, Tatjana', 'Holter, Wolfgang', 'Lakatos, Karoly', 'Kager, Leo', 'Trapin, Doris', 'Pickl, Winfried', 'Forster-Waldl, Elisabeth', 'Boztug, Kaan']","['Boztug H', 'Hirschmugl T', 'Holter W', 'Lakatos K', 'Kager L', 'Trapin D', 'Pickl W', 'Forster-Waldl E', 'Boztug K']","['St. Anna Kinderspital, Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Lazarettgasse 14 AKH BT 25.3, Vienna, Austria.', 'St. Anna Kinderspital, Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'St. Anna Kinderspital, Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'St. Anna Kinderspital, Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Immunology, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology, and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Immunology, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology, and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'St. Anna Kinderspital, Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. kboztug@cemm.oeaw.ac.at.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Lazarettgasse 14 AKH BT 25.3, Vienna, Austria. kboztug@cemm.oeaw.ac.at.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria. kboztug@cemm.oeaw.ac.at.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases, Lazarettgasse 14 AKH BT 25.3, Vienna, Austria. kboztug@cemm.oeaw.ac.at.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160623,Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Autoantibodies/blood/immunology', 'Biomarkers', 'Biopsy', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications/virology', 'Exome', 'Female', '*Haploinsufficiency', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*complications/*genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Combined immunodeficiency', '*EBV lymphoproliferative disease', '*NF-kappaB1', '*haploinsufficiency']",2016/06/25 06:00,2017/12/08 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10875-016-0306-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s10875-016-0306-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 2016 Aug;36(6):533-40. doi: 10.1007/s10875-016-0306-1.

METHODS: BCR-ABL leukemia was induced in 6-10-week-old female BALB/c mice by a single tail vein injection of the 12B1 cell line. Leukemia-induced animals were treated with KA at a dosage of 200 mg/kg body weight dissolved in 0.5 mL of olive oil for 14 days by gastrogavage. Imatinib mesylate was used as the control drug. Glycolytic, gluconeogenic, mitochondrial, tricarboxylic acid cycle and respiratory chain enzymes in the spleen and liver of mouse were compared between the control and experiment groups by biochemical assays. RESULTS: Leukemia-bearing mice showed a significant increase in glycolytic enzymes and a signififi cant decrease in gluconeogenic enzymes, tricarboxylic acid cycle and respiratory chain enzymes as compared with control animals. Treatment with KA signififi cantly reversed the changes seen in the levels of the glycolytic enzymes, gluconeogenic enzymes and mitochondrial enzymes.

Here we report the identification of a new cereblon modulator, CC-885, with potent anti-tumour activity. The anti-tumour activity of CC-885 is mediated through the cereblon-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of the translation termination factor GSPT1. Patient-derived acute myeloid leukaemia tumour cells exhibit high sensitivity to CC-885, indicating the clinical potential of this mechanism. Crystallographic studies of the CRBN-DDB1-CC-885-GSPT1 complex reveal that GSPT1 binds to cereblon through a surface turn containing a glycine residue at a key position, interacting with both CC-885 and a 'hotspot' on the cereblon surface. Although GSPT1 possesses no obvious structural, sequence or functional homology to previously known cereblon substrates, mutational analysis and modelling indicate that the cereblon substrate Ikaros uses a similar structural feature to bind cereblon, suggesting a common motif for substrate recruitment. These findings define a structural degron underlying cereblon 'neosubstrate' selectivity, and identify an anti-tumour target rendered druggable by cereblon modulation.","['Matyskiela, Mary E', 'Lu, Gang', 'Ito, Takumi', 'Pagarigan, Barbra', 'Lu, Chin-Chun', 'Miller, Karen', 'Fang, Wei', 'Wang, Nai-Yu', 'Nguyen, Derek', 'Houston, Jack', 'Carmel, Gilles', 'Tran, Tam', 'Riley, Mariko', ""Nosaka, Lyn'Al"", 'Lander, Gabriel C', 'Gaidarova, Svetlana', 'Xu, Shuichan', 'Ruchelman, Alexander L', 'Handa, Hiroshi', 'Carmichael, James', 'Daniel, Thomas O', 'Cathers, Brian E', 'Lopez-Girona, Antonia', 'Chamberlain, Philip P']","['Matyskiela ME', 'Lu G', 'Ito T', 'Pagarigan B', 'Lu CC', 'Miller K', 'Fang W', 'Wang NY', 'Nguyen D', 'Houston J', 'Carmel G', 'Tran T', 'Riley M', 'Nosaka L', 'Lander GC', 'Gaidarova S', 'Xu S', 'Ruchelman AL', 'Handa H', 'Carmichael J', 'Daniel TO', 'Cathers BE', 'Lopez-Girona A', 'Chamberlain PP']","['Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Department of Nanoparticle Translational Research, Tokyo Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8402, Japan.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'The Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'The Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Department of Nanoparticle Translational Research, Tokyo Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8402, Japan.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, 10300 Campus Point Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20160622,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CC-885)', '0 (CRBN protein, human)', '0 (DDB1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Peptide Termination Factors)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (peptide-chain-release factor 3)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/chemistry/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Multiprotein Complexes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Peptide Hydrolases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Peptide Termination Factors/chemistry/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Phenylurea Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/chemistry/metabolism']",,,2016/06/25 06:00,2016/08/16 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2015/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['nature18611 [pii]', '10.1038/nature18611 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2016 Jul 14;535(7611):252-7. doi: 10.1038/nature18611.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) is offered to these patients in order to improve their dismal outcome. We retrospectively analyzed 361 acute leukaemia patients, who underwent allogeneic SCT in the Hadassah's bone marrow transplantation department between the years 2005 and 2012 and identified 84 patients with active leukaemia at transplantation. Median age was 34 years. Sixty four patients were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 18 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and two with biphenotypic leukaemia. The majority of patients were diagnosed with de-novo AML and transplanted at relapse. In the surviving patients, median follow up was 15 months. One year OS was 20%. At time of last follow up, 13 patients were alive (15.5%): ten patients with AML and two patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In the univariate analysis, factors associated with significantly better overall survival were as follows: matched unrelated donor (p = 0.006), matched donor (p = 0.014) and occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (p = 0.019). Karnofsky performance score at SCT and occurrence of cGVHD were found to be borderline significant. Only matched unrelated donor and aGVHD were found to affect overall survival significantly in the multivariate analysis. Other than performance score at SCT, none of the pretransplant patients' characteristics were found to influence survival. In conclusion, as none of the pretransplant characteristics were found to influence the ability to select the patients that will benefit from HSC transplantation, this work supports offering HSCT to all active leukaemia eligible patients with reasonable performance status.

Signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM)-associated protein (SAP) is essential for early stages of iNKT cell development, but its role during terminal differentiation of iNKT1, iNKT2, or iNKT17 cells remains unclear. Taking advantage of SAP-deficient mice expressing a Valpha14-Jalpha18 TCRalpha transgene, we found that SAP is critical not only for IL-4 production but also for the terminal differentiation of IL-4-producing iNKT2 cells. Furthermore, without SAP, the IL-17 producing subset is expanded, while IFN-gamma-producing iNKT1 differentiation is only moderately compromised. Lack of SAP reduced the expression of the transcription factors GATA-3 and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger, but enhanced the levels of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gammat. In the absence of SAP, lineage commitment was actually shifted toward the emergence of iNKT17 over iNKT2 cells. Collectively, our data unveil a new critical regulatory function for SAP in thymic iNKT cell fate decisions.","['Michel, Marie-Laure', 'Lenoir, Christelle', 'Massot, Berangere', 'Diem, Severine', 'Pasquier, Benoit', 'Sawa, Shinichiro', 'Rignault-Bricard, Rachel', 'Lehuen, Agnes', 'Eberl, Gerard', 'Veillette, Andre', 'Leite-de-Moraes, Maria', 'Latour, Sylvain']","['Michel ML', 'Lenoir C', 'Massot B', 'Diem S', 'Pasquier B', 'Sawa S', 'Rignault-Bricard R', 'Lehuen A', 'Eberl G', 'Veillette A', 'Leite-de-Moraes M', 'Latour S']","['Laboratory of Immunoregulation and Immunopathology, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, CNRS UMR 8253 and INSERM UMR 1151, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Activation and EBV Susceptibility, INSERM UMR 1163, Institut des Maladies Genetiques, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunoregulation and Immunopathology, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, CNRS UMR 8253 and INSERM UMR 1151, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunoregulation and Immunopathology, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, CNRS UMR 8253 and INSERM UMR 1151, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Activation and EBV Susceptibility, INSERM UMR 1163, Institut des Maladies Genetiques, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.', 'Lymphoid Tissue Development Unit, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Immunoregulation and Immunopathology, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, CNRS UMR 8253 and INSERM UMR 1151, Paris, France.', 'Institut Imagine, Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Hopital Cochin-St. Vincent de Paul, INSERM UMR 986, Paris, France.', 'Lymphoid Tissue Development Unit, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Immunoregulation and Immunopathology, Institut Necker-Enfants Malades, CNRS UMR 8253 and INSERM UMR 1151, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Laboratory of Lymphocyte Activation and EBV Susceptibility, INSERM UMR 1163, Institut des Maladies Genetiques, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France. sylvain.latour@inserm.fr.', 'Institut Imagine, Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France. sylvain.latour@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160722,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Associated Protein)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-17/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Associated Protein/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*cytology/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*IL-17', '*IL-4', '*PLZF', '*SAP', '*Thymic development', '*iNKT cells']",2016/06/25 06:00,2017/07/01 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2016/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201646313 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2016 Sep;46(9):2162-74. doi: 10.1002/eji.201646313.

MicroRNAs are key regulators in all cellular processes, though the mechanism by which the cell activates or represses microRNA-mediated translational regulation is poorly understood. In this review, we discuss the RNA binding protein Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) and its role in microRNA-mediated translational regulation. Historically, FMRP is known to function as a translational suppressor. However, emerging data suggests that FMRP has both an agonistic and antagonistic role in regulating microRNA-mediated translational suppression. This bi-functional role is dependent on FMRP's interaction with the RNA helicase Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10), which modifies the structural landscape of bound mRNA, therefore facilitating or inhibiting its association with the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex.","['Kenny, Phillip', 'Ceman, Stephanie']","['Kenny P', 'Ceman S']","['Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA. pjkenny2@illinois.edu.', 'Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA. sceman@illinois.edu.', 'College of Medicine, University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA. sceman@illinois.edu.', 'Neuroscience Program, University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, B107 Chemical Life Sciences Laboratory, Urbana, IL 61801, USA. sceman@illinois.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160622,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (FMR1 protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '139135-51-6 (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein/genetics/*metabolism', '*G-Quadruplexes', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Helicases/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['FMRP', 'G-Quadruplex', 'MOV10', 'RNA binding proteins', 'microRNA', 'secondary structure']",2016/06/25 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2016/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms17060985 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms17060985 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2016 Jun 22;17(6). pii: ijms17060985. doi: 10.3390/ijms17060985.,10.3390/ijms17060985 [doi] E985 [pii],['R01 MH093661/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4926514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In its dozens of clinical features, those with independent prognostic value are still not well characterized. We retrospectively included 362 patients with newly diagnosed POEMS syndrome at our institute from 2000 to 2015. On the basis of a randomized sample splitting, we first identified four baseline clinical variables, including age >50 years (hazards ratio (HR) 4.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41-11.76, P=0.009), pulmonary hypertension (HR 3.99, 95% CI 1.44-11.04, P=0.008), pleural effusion (HR 3.81, 95% CI 1.23-11.79, P=0.02) and estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (HR 8.25, 95% CI 2.18-31.25, P=0.002), associated with inferior overall survival in the derivation cohort, with the use of multivariate Cox regression model. These factors were incorporated together to develop a prognostic nomogram. Concordance index calculation (0.727, 95% CI 0.601-0.853, P=0.018) and calibration curve plotting demonstrated its significant predictive and discriminatory capacity in the validation cohort.

These cell subsets include monocytic and granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M- and G-MDSCs) defined by their ability to suppress T-cell responses. MDSCs are a heterogeneous population described in inflammatory and infectious diseases and in numerous tumors including multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and DLBCL. However, their mechanisms of action remain unclear. We broadly assessed the presence and mechanisms of suppression of MDSC subsets in DLBCL. First, a myeloid suppressive signature was identified by gene expression profiling in DLBCL peripheral blood. Accordingly, we identified, in a cohort of 66 DLBCL patients, an increase in circulating G-MDSC (Lin(neg)HLA-DR(neg)CD33(pos)CD11b(pos)) and M-MDSC (CD14(pos)HLA-DR(low)) counts. Interestingly, only M-MDSC number was correlated with the International Prognostic Index, event-free survival, and number of circulating Tregs. Furthermore, T-cell proliferation was restored after monocyte depletion. Myeloid-dependent T-cell suppression was attributed to a release of interleukin-10 and S100A12 and increased PD-L1 expression. In summary, we identified expanded MDSC subsets in DLBCL, as well as new mechanisms of immunosuppression in DLBCL.","['Azzaoui, Imane', 'Uhel, Fabrice', 'Rossille, Delphine', 'Pangault, Celine', 'Dulong, Joelle', 'Le Priol, Jerome', 'Lamy, Thierry', 'Houot, Roch', 'Le Gouill, Steven', 'Cartron, Guillaume', 'Godmer, Pascal', 'Bouabdallah, Krimo', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Damaj, Gandhi', 'Tarte, Karin', 'Fest, Thierry', 'Roussel, Mikael']","['Azzaoui I', 'Uhel F', 'Rossille D', 'Pangault C', 'Dulong J', 'Le Priol J', 'Lamy T', 'Houot R', 'Le Gouill S', 'Cartron G', 'Godmer P', 'Bouabdallah K', 'Milpied N', 'Damaj G', 'Tarte K', 'Fest T', 'Roussel M']","['Pole Biologie and.', 'Maladies Infectieuses et Reanimation Medicale, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes, Rennes, France; INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Rennes, France; Universite Rennes 1, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Rennes, France; Etablissement Francais du Sang Bretagne, Rennes, France;', 'Pole Biologie and INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Rennes, France; Universite Rennes 1, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Rennes, France; Etablissement Francais du Sang Bretagne, Rennes, France;', 'Pole Biologie and INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Rennes, France; Universite Rennes 1, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Rennes, France; Etablissement Francais du Sang Bretagne, Rennes, France;', 'Pole Biologie and INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Rennes, France; Universite Rennes 1, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Rennes, France; Etablissement Francais du Sang Bretagne, Rennes, France;', 'Pole Biologie and.', ""INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Rennes, France; Universite Rennes 1, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Rennes, France; Etablissement Francais du Sang Bretagne, Rennes, France; Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes, Rennes, France;"", ""INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Rennes, France; Universite Rennes 1, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Rennes, France; Etablissement Francais du Sang Bretagne, Rennes, France; Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes, Rennes, France;"", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nantes, Unite Mixte de Recherche 892 equipe 10, Nantes, France;"", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Montpellier, Montpellier, France;"", ""Unite d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier de Bretagne Atlantique, Vannes, France;"", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France; and."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France; and."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Caen, Caen, France."", 'Pole Biologie and INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Rennes, France; Universite Rennes 1, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Rennes, France; Etablissement Francais du Sang Bretagne, Rennes, France;', 'Pole Biologie and INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Rennes, France; Universite Rennes 1, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Rennes, France; Etablissement Francais du Sang Bretagne, Rennes, France;', 'Pole Biologie and INSERM, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Rennes, France; Universite Rennes 1, Unite Mixte de Recherche U917, Rennes, France; Etablissement Francais du Sang Bretagne, Rennes, France;']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20160623,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)', '0 (S100A12 Protein)', '0 (S100A12 protein, human)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'EC 3.5.3.1 (Arginase)']",IM,"['Arginase/metabolism', 'B7-H1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/*immunology', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'S100A12 Protein/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transcriptome/genetics']",,,2016/06/25 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2015/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34212-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-08-662783 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Aug 25;128(8):1081-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-08-662783.

Here, we showed that RNA interference-mediated depletion of CCND1 increased caspase-3 activities and induced apoptosis in the human MCL lines UPN-1 and JEKO-1. In vitro and xenotransplant studies revealed that the toxic effect of CCND1 depletion in MCL cells was likely due to increase in histone H2AX phosphorylation, a DNA damage marker. DNA fiber analysis suggested deregulated replication initiation after CCND1 depletion as a potential cause of DNA damage. Finally, in contrast to depletion or inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4, CCND1 depletion increased chemosensitivity of MCL cells to replication inhibitors hydroxyurea and cytarabine. Our findings have an important implication for CCND1 as a potential therapeutic target in MCL patients who are refractory to standard chemotherapy.","['Mohanty, Suchismita', 'Mohanty, Atish', 'Sandoval, Natalie', 'Tran, Thai', 'Bedell, Victoria', 'Wu, Jun', 'Scuto, Anna', 'Murata-Collins, Joyce', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Ngo, Vu N']","['Mohanty S', 'Mohanty A', 'Sandoval N', 'Tran T', 'Bedell V', 'Wu J', 'Scuto A', 'Murata-Collins J', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Ngo VN']","['a Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research , Beckman Research Institute , Duarte , CA , USA.', 'a Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research , Beckman Research Institute , Duarte , CA , USA.', 'a Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research , Beckman Research Institute , Duarte , CA , USA.', 'b Irell & Manella Graduate School of Biological Sciences , Duarte , CA , USA.', 'c Department of Pathology , City of Hope National Medical Center , Duarte , CA , USA.', 'd Animal Resource Center , Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope , Duarte , CA , USA.', 'c Department of Pathology , City of Hope National Medical Center , Duarte , CA , USA.', 'c Department of Pathology , City of Hope National Medical Center , Duarte , CA , USA.', 'c Department of Pathology , City of Hope National Medical Center , Duarte , CA , USA.', 'a Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research , Beckman Research Institute , Duarte , CA , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160624,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cyclin D1/*metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Replication', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chemoresistance', '*DNA damage', '*cyclin D1', '*mantle cell lymphoma', '*replication stress']",2016/06/25 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/06/25 06:00'],"['2016/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2016.1198958 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2017 Mar;58(3):676-688. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2016.1198958.

Improved prognostication at the time of diagnosis, such as with the Wheatley Index, may aid clinical decision-making. Pre-treatment quality of life (QOL) or objective physical performance measures (PPMs) may also predict outcomes such as mortality in oncology. We investigated the predictive value of the Wheatley Index, QOL and PPMs at diagnosis on one-year mortality in older (60+ years) AML patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy (IC) in a large AML referral center. AML patients undergoing IC were enrolled in a single-center prospective study. The Wheatley prognostic risk category (good, standard and poor) was determined. Predictors of one-year mortality were assessed with logistic regression. Overall one-year mortality was 37.1%. QOL and PPMs at diagnosis were not good predictors of one-year mortality. Poor Wheatley risk category was the strongest predictor in both univariate and multivariable mortality models (adjusted odds ratio 7.1, 95% confidence interval 1.95-25.5, p<0.001). The Wheatley index may be useful to clinicians and patients by providing an integrated prognostic tool to guide up-front therapy in AML.","['Timilshina, Narhari', 'Breunis, Henriette', 'Tomlinson, George', 'Brandwein, Joseph', 'Alibhai, Shabbir M H']","['Timilshina N', 'Breunis H', 'Tomlinson G', 'Brandwein J', 'Alibhai SM']","['Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; Institute of Health Policy, Management, and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Institute of Health Policy, Management, and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Institute of Health Policy, Management, and Evaluation, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

On the basis of these findings, the main aim of this study was to elucidate some of the molecular mechanisms involved in apoptosis induced by chalcone A1 toward K562 and Jurkat cells. In both cell lines, chalcone A1 decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, increased the expression of Bax proapoptotic protein, and decreased the expression of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic protein (resulting in the inversion of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio), which indicates the involvement of the intrinsic pathway. In addition, chalcone A1 increased the expression of FasR in Jurkat cells, which also indicates the involvement of the extrinsic pathway in this cell line. The results also showed an increased expression of effector caspase-3 and cleaved PARP-1 and a decreased expression of IAP protein survivin, which are consistent with apoptotic cell death. The decreased expression of Ki67 suggests that the mechanism involved in cell death induced by chalcone A1 also involves a decrease in cell proliferation. In ex-vivo experiments, chalcone A1 reduced the cell viability of blast cells collected from eight patients with different types of acute leukemia, confirming the cytotoxicity results found in vitro. The results obtained so far are very promising and further studies need to be carried out so that chalcone A1 can be used as a prototype for the development of new antileukemia agents.","['Maioral, Mariana Franzoni', 'Moraes, Ana Carolina Rabello de', 'Sgambatti, Karen Ristau', 'Mascarello, Alessandra', 'Chiaradia-Delatorre, Louise Domeneghini', 'Yunes, Rosendo Augusto', 'Nunes, Ricardo Jose', 'Santos da Silva, Maria Claudia']","['Maioral MF', 'Moraes AC', 'Sgambatti KR', 'Mascarello A', 'Chiaradia-Delatorre LD', 'Yunes RA', 'Nunes RJ', 'Santos da Silva MC']","['aExperimental Oncology Laboratory, Department of Clinical Analysis bStructure and Activity Laboratory, Department of Chemistry cPost-Graduation Program in Pharmacy-PGFAR, Federal Universtiy of Santa Catarina, Campus Trindade, CEP: 88040-900, Florianopolis - Santa Catarina, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(1-naphthyl)-2-propene-1-one)', '0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chalcones/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*blood/drug therapy', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Survivin', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,2016/06/24 06:00,2017/12/30 06:00,['2016/06/24 06:00'],"['2016/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000384 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2016 Sep;27(8):738-47. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000384.,10.1097/CAD.0000000000000384 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we examine the information described in recent patents and the extent to which new findings are influencing extending retinoid-based differentiation therapy to other cancers, as well as the development of new therapies for other disorders. AREAS COVERED: A search has been performed on the literature and worldwide patents filed during 2014 to the present time, focusing on synthetic agonists and antagonists of retinoic acid receptors and novel compositions for the delivery of these agents. EXPERT OPINION: New potential therapeutic applications have been described, including lung, breast and head and neck cancers, T cell lymphoma and neurodegenerative, metabolic, ophthalmic, muscle, and inflammatory disorders. Recent patents have described the means to maximise retinoid activity. Two decades of efforts to extend retinoid-based therapies have been disappointing and new synthetic retinoids, target diseases and modes of delivery may well resolve this long standing issue.","['Marchwicka, Aleksandra', 'Cunningham, Alan', 'Marcinkowska, Ewa', 'Brown, Geoffrey']","['Marchwicka A', 'Cunningham A', 'Marcinkowska E', 'Brown G']","['a Laboratory of Protein Biochemistry, Faculty of Biotechnology , University of Wroclaw , Wroclaw , Poland.', 'b Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences , University of Birmingham , Birmingham , UK.', 'a Laboratory of Protein Biochemistry, Faculty of Biotechnology , University of Wroclaw , Wroclaw , Poland.', 'c Institute of Clinical Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences , University of Birmingham , Birmingham , UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160711,England,Expert Opin Ther Pat,Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,9516419,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Patents as Topic', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Retinoids/*administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*RARs', '*RXRs', '*leukaemia', '*retinoids', '*skin diseases', '*therapy']",2016/06/24 06:00,2017/03/18 06:00,['2016/06/24 06:00'],"['2016/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/13543776.2016.1205586 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Pat. 2016 Aug;26(8):957-71. doi: 10.1080/13543776.2016.1205586.

Hax1 is an anti-apoptotic protein with additional roles in cell motility, and autosomal recessive loss of Hax1 results in Kostmann syndrome, a form of severe congenital neutropenia. Because of the important role of Hax1 in neutrophils we demonstrate here validation of two commercially available research antibodies directed against human Hax1 in the human myeloid leukemia cell line PLB-985 cells. We show that both the mouse anti-Hax1 monoclonal IgG directed against amino acids 10-148 of Hax1 and a rabbit anti-Hax1 polyclonal IgG antibody directed against full-length Hax1 reliably and consistently detect Hax1 during immunoblotting of three different PLB-985 cell densities. Using shRNA mediated Hax1 knockdown, we demonstrate the specificity of both Hax1 antibodies. In addition, our results suggest that the rabbit anti-Hax1 polyclonal antibody provides a stronger intensity in detecting Hax1 protein, with detection in as few as 0.1 x 10 (6) cells in 6 total replicates we have performed.","['Cavnar, Peter', 'Inman, Kristina']","['Cavnar P', 'Inman K']","['Department of Biology, University of West Florida, Pensacola, Florida, 32514, USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of West Florida, Pensacola, Florida, 32514, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150610,England,F1000Res,F1000Research,101594320,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hax1', 'PLB-985', 'neutrophil', 'tubulin']",2015/01/01 00:00,2015/01/01 00:01,['2016/06/30 06:00'],"['2015/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.12688/f1000research.6516.2 [doi]'],epublish,F1000Res. 2015 Jun 10;4:148. doi: 10.12688/f1000research.6516.2. eCollection 2015.,10.12688/f1000research.6516.2 [doi],,PMC4893944,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The likely mechanism by which DNMT3A loss contributes to leukemogenesis is altered DNA methylation and the attendant gene expression changes; however, our current understanding is incomplete. We observed that murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in which Dnmt3a had been conditionally deleted markedly overexpress the histone 3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase, Dot1l. We demonstrate that Dnmt3a(-/-) HSCs have increased H3K79 methylation relative to wild-type (WT) HSCs, with the greatest increases noted at DNA methylation canyons, which are regions highly enriched for genes dysregulated in leukemia and prone to DNA methylation loss with Dnmt3a deletion. These findings led us to explore DOT1L as a therapeutic target for the treatment of DNMT3A-mutant AML. We show that pharmacologic inhibition of DOT1L resulted in decreased expression of oncogenic canyon-associated genes and led to dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and terminal differentiation in DNMT3A-mutant cell lines in vitro. We show in vivo efficacy of the DOT1L inhibitor EPZ5676 in a nude rat xenograft model of DNMT3A-mutant AML. DOT1L inhibition was also effective against primary patient DNMT3A-mutant AML samples, reducing colony-forming capacity (CFC) and inducing terminal differentiation in vitro. These studies suggest that DOT1L may play a critical role in DNMT3A-mutant leukemia. With pharmacologic inhibitors of DOT1L already in clinical trials, DOT1L could be an immediately actionable therapeutic target for the treatment of this poor prognosis disease.","['Rau, Rachel E', 'Rodriguez, Benjamin A', 'Luo, Min', 'Jeong, Mira', 'Rosen, Allison', 'Rogers, Jason H', 'Campbell, Carly T', 'Daigle, Scott R', 'Deng, Lishing', 'Song, Yongcheng', 'Sweet, Steve', 'Chevassut, Timothy', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Li, Wei', 'Goodell, Margaret A']","['Rau RE', 'Rodriguez BA', 'Luo M', 'Jeong M', 'Rosen A', 'Rogers JH', 'Campbell CT', 'Daigle SR', 'Deng L', 'Song Y', 'Sweet S', 'Chevassut T', 'Andreeff M', 'Kornblau SM', 'Li W', 'Goodell MA']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX; Dan L.

In a multicenter retrospective study, we described changes in risk over time, the consequences for basal prognostic scores, and their potential clinical implications. Major MDS prognostic risk scoring systems and their constituent individual predictors were analyzed in 7212 primary untreated MDS patients from the International Working Group for Prognosis in MDS database. Changes in risk of mortality and of leukemic transformation over time from diagnosis were described. Hazards regarding mortality and acute myeloid leukemia transformation diminished over time from diagnosis in higher-risk MDS patients, whereas they remained stable in lower-risk patients. After approximately 3.5 years, hazards in the separate risk groups became similar and were essentially equivalent after 5 years. This fact led to loss of prognostic power of different scoring systems considered, which was more pronounced for survival. Inclusion of age resulted in increased initial prognostic power for survival and less attenuation in hazards. If needed for practicability in clinical management, the differing development of risks suggested a reasonable division into lower- and higher-risk MDS based on the IPSS-R at a cutoff of 3.5 points. Our data regarding time-dependent performance of prognostic scores reflect the disparate change of risks in MDS subpopulations. Lower-risk patients at diagnosis remain lower risk whereas initially high-risk patients demonstrate decreasing risk over time. This change of risk should be considered in clinical decision making.","['Pfeilstocker, Michael', 'Tuechler, Heinz', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Schanz, Julie', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Bennett, John M', 'Bowen, David', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Kuendgen, Andrea', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Cermak, Jaroslav', 'Fonatsch, Christa', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Levis, Alessandro', 'Luebbert, Michael', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw', 'Machherndl-Spandl, Sigrid', 'Magalhaes, Silvia M M', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Stauder, Reinhard', 'Tauro, Sudhir', 'Valent, Peter', 'Vallespi, Teresa', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Haase, Detlef', 'Greenberg, Peter L']","['Pfeilstocker M', 'Tuechler H', 'Sanz G', 'Schanz J', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Sole F', 'Bennett JM', 'Bowen D', 'Fenaux P', 'Dreyfus F', 'Kantarjian H', 'Kuendgen A', 'Malcovati L', 'Cazzola M', 'Cermak J', 'Fonatsch C', 'Le Beau MM', 'Slovak ML', 'Levis A', 'Luebbert M', 'Maciejewski J', 'Machherndl-Spandl S', 'Magalhaes SM', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Sekeres MA', 'Sperr WR', 'Stauder R', 'Tauro S', 'Valent P', 'Vallespi T', 'van de Loosdrecht AA', 'Germing U', 'Haase D', 'Greenberg PL']","['Hanusch Hospital and L.

The first-line treatment is imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, that has showed good results, but with a significant percentage of treatment failure. This failure has led to second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors as second-line treatment such as dasatinib. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of dasatinib as second-line treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, longitudinal, and retrospective study. Patients with diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia that presented failure to first-line treatment were included in the present study; the hematologic response was evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months, and molecular response at 12 months of follow-up after dasatinib treatment was started. RESULTS: Of a total of 14 patients that were included in the study, a response in the white cell count of 84.6% with a mean response at 4.7 months of follow-up was observed; also 84.6% platelet response with a mean response at 4.7 months of follow-up. Molecular response was also evaluated at a 12-month follow-up, achieving a 50% response with a mean response at 11.08 months of follow-up. A survival rate of 80% at a 12-month follow-up was observed.

Osteoinductive pretreatment, which induces the osteoblastic differentiation of hMSCs in vitro, has been widely used for bone tissue engineering prior to cell transplantation. However, the molecular basis of osteoblastic differentiation induced by osteoinductive medium (OIM) is still unknown. Therefore, we used a next-generation sequencer to investigate the changes in gene expression during the osteoblastic differentiation of hMSCs. The hMSCs used in this study possessed both multipotency and self-renewal ability. Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 (ZBTB16) was significantly increased during the osteoblastogenesis of hMSCs. ZBTB16 mRNA and protein expression was enhanced by culturing the hMSCs with OIM. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing of ZBTB16 decreased the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP); the expression of osteogenic genes, such as osteocalcin (OCN) and bone sialoprotein (BSP), and the mineralized nodule formation induced by OIM. siRNA-mediated gene silencing of Osterix (Osx), which is known as an essential regulator of osteoblastic differentiation, markedly downregulated the expression of ZBTB16. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed that Osx associated with the ZBTB16 promoter region containing the GC-rich canonical Sp1 sequence, which is the specific Osx binding site. These findings suggest that ZBTB16 acts as a downstream transcriptional regulator of Osx and can be useful as a late marker of osteoblastic differentiation. J. Cell. Biochem. 117: 2423-2434, 2016.

Due to the long survival and the feasibility of oral or subcutaneous therapy, these patients are frequently treated outside of larger academic centers. This analysis was performed to elucidate differences in MPN patients in three different health care settings: university hospitals (UH), community hospitals (CH), and office-based physicians (OBP). The MPN registry of the Study Alliance Leukemia is a non-interventional prospective study including adult patients with an MPN according to WHO criteria (2008). For statistical analysis, descriptive methods and tests for significant differences were used. Besides a different distribution of MPN subtypes between the settings, patients contributed by UH showed an impaired medical condition, a higher comorbidity burden, and more vascular complications. In the risk group analyses, the majority of polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients from UH were classified into the high-risk category due to previous vascular events, while for PV and ET patients in the CH and OBP settings, age was the major parameter for a high-risk categorization. Regarding MPN-directed therapy, PV patients from the UH setting were more likely to receive ruxolitinib within the framework of a clinical trial. In summary, the characteristics and management of patients differed significantly between the three health care settings with a higher burden of vascular events and comorbidities in patients contributed by UH. These differences need to be taken into account for further analyses and design of clinical trials.","['Kaifie, A', 'Isfort, S', 'Gattermann, N', 'Hollburg, W', 'Klausmann, M', 'Wolf, D', 'Maintz, C', 'Hanel, M', 'Goekkurt, E', 'Gothert, J R', 'Platzbecker, U', 'Geer, T', 'Parmentier, S', 'Jost, E', 'Serve, H', 'Ehninger, G', 'Berdel, W E', 'Brummendorf, T H', 'Koschmieder, Steffen']","['Kaifie A', 'Isfort S', 'Gattermann N', 'Hollburg W', 'Klausmann M', 'Wolf D', 'Maintz C', 'Hanel M', 'Goekkurt E', 'Gothert JR', 'Platzbecker U', 'Geer T', 'Parmentier S', 'Jost E', 'Serve H', 'Ehninger G', 'Berdel WE', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Koschmieder S']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Occupational and Social Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine University Dusseldorf, Moorenstrasse 5, 40225, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Practice for Hematology and Oncology Altona, Morkenstrasse 47, 22767, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Practice for Hematology and Oncology, Elisenstrasse 28, 63739, Aschaffenburg, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine 3, Oncology, Hematology, Immunooncology, and Rheumatology, University Clinic Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Strasse 25, 53127, Bonn, Germany.', 'Practice for Hematology and Oncology, Mauerfeldchen 72, 52146, Wurselen, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, Oncology, Stem Cell Transplantation, Hospital Chemnitz, Burgerstrasse 2, 09113, Chemnitz, Germany.', 'Practice for Hematology-Oncology Eppendorf, Eppendorfer Landstrasse 42, 20249, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, University Hospital Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45147, Essen, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, University Hospital Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department for Internal Medicine III, Diakonie Hospital Schwabisch Hall, Diakoniestrasse 20, 74523, Schwabisch-Hall, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Care, Rems-Murr-Hospitals, Am Jakobsweg 1, 71364, Winnenden, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Frankfurt/Main, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department for Hematology, University Hospital Dresden, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, 48149, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany. skoschmieder@ukaachen.de.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20160622,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Delivery of Health Care/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Community/statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitals, University/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/genetics/*therapy', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Physicians/statistics & numerical data', ""Physicians' Offices/statistics & numerical data"", 'Prospective Studies', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', '*Severity of Illness Index', 'Symptom Assessment/methods/*statistics & numerical data']",['NOTNLM'],"['Comorbidities', 'Essential thrombocythemia', 'Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN)', 'Polycythemia vera', 'Primary myelofibrosis', 'Vascular events']",2016/06/24 06:00,2017/02/06 06:00,['2016/06/24 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2730-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2730-y [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Sep;95(9):1399-410. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2730-y.

The clinical course of our patient was complicated by symptomatic thrombophilia and chemoresistance. In addition, our case exhibited FLT3 (Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3) internal tandem duplication. Although anagrelide was successful in controlling elevated platelet counts, allogeneic stem cell transplantation failed to overcome chemoresistance due to simultaneous graft-versus-host-disease and relapse of acute myeloid leukemia.

We retrospectively analyzed 51 CML patients treated with TKIs at a single institution between 2002 and 2014.

Our treatments included both 1st generation TKIs (60.8%) and 2nd generation TKIs (39.2%). We found that the overall response rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), major molecular response (MMR), and MR4 (molecular response 4) were 90.2%, 78.4%, and 64.7%, respectively. Second line 2nd generation TKIs had response rates equivalent to those of 1st line 1st generation TKIs. Moreover, 1st line 2nd generation TKIs tended to achieve an early response rate. Overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 93.2%. Sudden blastic crisis (BC) occurred in 2 CML patients receiving TKI with CCyR status. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed for BC (n = 1) and sudden BC (n = 2). Side effects of all grades (1-3) and grade 3 alone were 64.7% and 11.8%, respectively. Dose reduction, replacement with another TKI, or low dose TKI treatment may be useful methods to control side effects. Further reasons of TKI discontinuation were economic problems (n = 3) and pregnancy (n = 1). Consequently, our treatment strategy for CML demonstrated good response rate and OS. Currently, treatment discontinuation due to intolerance, resistance, economic problems, pregnancy, and sudden BC remains a concern in clinical practice.","['Kawano, Noriaki', 'Yoshida, Shuro', 'Kawano, Sayaka', 'Kuriyama, Takuro', 'Yamashita, Kiyoshi', 'Ochiai, Hidenobu', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Ishikawa, Fumihiko', 'Ueda, Akira', 'Kikuchi, Ikuo']","['Kawano N', 'Yoshida S', 'Kawano S', 'Kuriyama T', 'Yamashita K', 'Ochiai H', 'Shimoda K', 'Ishikawa F', 'Ueda A', 'Kikuchi I']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/enzymology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/06/24 06:00,2017/03/18 06:00,['2016/06/24 06:00'],"['2016/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3960/jslrt.56.34 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2016;56(1):34-42. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.56.34.,10.3960/jslrt.56.34 [doi],,PMC6144279,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to develop new pyrazole derivatives as potential anticancer and/or antiinflammatory agents. Their molecular mechanisms of action have been investigated. METHOD: a series of new triarylpyrazole derivatives were synthesized. Their in vitro anticancer activity was tested against NCI-58 cancer cell line panel of nine cancer types. The most active compound 1a was tested against sixteen kinases, many of them are known to be over-expressed in leukemia and breast cancer. The most sensitive kinases were V600E-B-RAF, C-RAF, FLT3, and P38alpha/MAPK14. Compound 1a was further tested for caspase-3/7 activity and LDH release assay as measures of its apoptotic and necrotic activities against RPMI-8226. Moreover, the ability of compounds 1a, 1b, and 1g to inhibit nitric oxide and prostaglandin Eproduction in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages was also examined. RESULTS: Compounds 1a, 1c, and 1g showed the highest activities against the cancer cell line panel, with more inhibitory effects against leukemia and breast cancer subpanels. The highest activity was exerted by compound 1a. Its IC50 values against RPMI-8226, K-562 leukemia cell lines, and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line were 1.71 muM, 3.42 muM, and 6.70 muM, respectively. The IC50 of compound 1a against P38alpha/MAPK14 kinase was 0.515 muM. The caspase activity was increased by 72% and 170% at 1.23 muM and 3.70 muM concentrations of compound 1a, respectively. Furthermore, compound 1b inhibited 80.26% and 95.31% of NO and PGE2 productions, respectively, at 50 muM concentration in the LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. CONCLUSION: Compound 1a could kill the cells through induction of apoptosis rather than necrosis. Compound 1a was more selective against cancer cells than non-cancerous cells. In addition, the hydroxyl analogue 1b was the most active as antiinflammatory agent.","['El-Gamal, Mohammed I', 'Abdel-Maksoud, Mohammed S', 'Gamal El-Din, Mahmoud M', 'Shin, Ji-Sun', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae', 'Yoo, Kyung Ho', 'Oh, Chang-Hyun']","['El-Gamal MI', 'Abdel-Maksoud MS', 'Gamal El-Din MM', 'Shin JS', 'Lee KT', 'Yoo KH', 'Oh CH']","['Center for Biomaterials, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, PO Box 131, Cheongryang, Seoul 130-650, Republic of Korea.

Monocyte-derived cells, including nurse-like cells (NLC) in CLL, promote lymphocyte proliferation and survival, confer resistance to chemotherapy, and are associated with more rapid disease progression. Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) regulates the homeostatic survival of tissue-resident macrophages. Therefore, we sought to determine whether CSF-1R is similarly required for NLC survival. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CSF-1R expression by NLC was examined by flow cytometry and IHC. CSF-1R blocking studies were performed using an antagonistic mAb to examine its role in NLC generation and in CLL survival. A rational search strategy was performed to identify a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting CSF-1R. The influence of TKI-mediated CSF-1R inhibition on NLC and CLL viability was examined. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the generation and survival of NLC in CLL is dependent upon CSF-1R signaling. CSF-1R blockade is associated with significant depletion of NLC and consequently inhibits CLL B-cell survival. We found that the JAK2/FLT3 inhibitor pacritinib suppresses CSF-1R signaling, thereby preventing the generation and survival of NLC and impairs CLL B-cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: CSF-1R is a novel therapeutic target that may be exploited in lymphoproliferative disorders, like CLL, that are dependent upon lymphoma-associated macrophages.

METHODS: Of 101 patients receiving allograft in CML CP, 85 had available quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction data at post-transplant 3 months. These patients were divided into two groups according to molecular response (MR(4.5)), defined as a BCR-ABL1 transcript level </= 0.0032% on the international scale, at 3 months based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of relapse. RESULTS: The 4-year overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) were 80.6% and 57.3%, respectively, and the cumulative incidence of relapse at 4 years was 29.6% after a median follow-up of 126.4 months. We performed multivariate analyses including potential variables to evaluate the early predictive role of MR(4.5) at 3 months and found that MR(4.5) at 3 months was associated with a higher EFS (p = 0.028) and showed a trend for a lower relapse rate (p = 0.089).

For example, enhanced splenic concentration of active agents could provide therapeutic benefits in spleen resident infections and hematological disorders including malaria, hairy cell leukemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Furthermore, spleen delivery of immunosuppressant agents using splenotropic carriers may reduce the chances of allograft rejection in organ transplantation. Enhanced concentration of radiopharmaceuticals in the spleen may improve visualization of the organ, which could provide benefit in the diagnosis of splenic disorders. Unique anatomical features of the spleen including specialized microvasculature environment and slow blood circulation rate enable it an ideal drug delivery site. Because there is a difference in blood flow between spleen and liver, splenic delivery is inversely proportional to the hepatic uptake. It is therefore desirable engineering of nanocarriers, which, upon intravenous administration, can avoid uptake by hepatic Kupffer cells to enhance splenic localization. Stealth and non-spherical nanocarriers have shown enhanced splenic delivery of active agents by avoiding hepatic uptake. The present review details the research in the field of splenotropy. Formulation strategies to design splenotropic drug delivery systems are discussed. The review also highlights the clinical relevance of spleen targeting of nanocarriers and application in diagnostics.","['Jindal, Anil B']",['Jindal AB'],"['Department of Pharmacy, Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani Campus, Pilani, Rajasthan, 333031, India. anil_jndl@yahoo.co.in.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Drug Deliv Transl Res,Drug delivery and translational research,101540061,['0 (Drug Carriers)'],IM,"['Drug Carriers/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Humans', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage', 'Splenic Diseases/*drug therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Biodistribution', '*Nanocarriers', '*Particle shape', '*Splenotropy', '*Stealth', '*Targeting']",2016/06/24 06:00,2018/01/02 06:00,['2016/06/24 06:00'],"['2016/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13346-016-0304-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s13346-016-0304-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Drug Deliv Transl Res. 2016 Oct;6(5):473-85. doi: 10.1007/s13346-016-0304-0.,10.1007/s13346-016-0304-0 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite advances in understanding the biology, it remains one of the most difficult paediatric cancers to treat partly due to the development of multidrug resistance. There is thus a compelling demand for new treatment strategies that can bypass resistance mechanisms. The pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepine (PBOX) compounds are a series of novel microtubule-targeting agents that potently induce apoptosis in various tumour models. We have previously reported that PBOX compounds induce apoptosis in drug sensitive and multidrug resistant neuroblastoma cells and synergistically enhance apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutics such as carboplatin. In this study we present further data concerning the molecular basis of PBOX-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma. We demonstrate that PBOX-6 induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation and downstream acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) appeared to serve as the upstream signal for AMPK activation as pretreatment of cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine inhibited both AMPK activation and PBOX-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, activation of AMPK by PBOX-6 was found to inhibit mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of PBOX-6 in an in vivo xenograft model of neuroblastoma. This study provides new insights into understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in PBOX-induced cell death in neuroblastoma and further supports their future use as novel anti-cancer agents for the treatment of neuroblastoma.","['Lennon, Jennifer C', 'Butini, Stefania', 'Campiani, Giuseppe', ""O'Meara, Anne"", 'Williams, D Clive', 'Zisterer, Daniela M']","['Lennon JC', 'Butini S', 'Campiani G', ""O'Meara A"", 'Williams DC', 'Zisterer DM']","['School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, 152-160 Pearse Street, Dublin 2, Ireland. lennonje@tcd.ie.', ""The National Children's Research Centre, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland. lennonje@tcd.ie."", 'European Research Centre for Drug Discovery & Development (NatSynDrugs), University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'European Research Centre for Drug Discovery & Development (NatSynDrugs), University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', ""Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin 12, Ireland."", 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, 152-160 Pearse Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.', 'School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity College Dublin, 152-160 Pearse Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160622,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oxazepines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 6.4.1.2 (Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase)', 'IN93MQ497D (PBOX-6)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase/metabolism', 'Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carboplatin/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxazepines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tubulin Modulators/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AMPK', '*Mcl-1', '*PBOX-6', '*mTOR']",2016/06/24 06:00,2017/12/15 06:00,['2016/06/24 06:00'],"['2016/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10637-016-0366-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s10637-016-0366-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2016 Oct;34(5):663-76. doi: 10.1007/s10637-016-0366-3.

However, a few studies indirectly show that ED may appear in ALL children before treatment begins. Hence, in this study we intended to verify the hypothesis that ED is part of the ALL phenotype. PATIENTS/METHODS: Twenty-eight ALL children and 14 healthy age-matched control children were recruited. The study group was examined at baseline, then at the 33rd and 78th day of treatment. At each step of the protocol endothelial vasodilative function was assessed by a laser Doppler flowmeter, which was followed by blood collecting for subsequent analyses. RESULTS: Compared to controls, the study group at baseline was characterized by significantly lower endothelial vasodilative responsiveness, accompanied by elevated asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) concentrations, which were correlated with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate transaminase (AST). Initial ALL treatment restored endothelial function, which followed changes in ADMA and LDH concentrations. DISCUSSION: This is the first demonstration that functionally assessed ED is present in ALL children at the diagnosis and results from elevated ADMA and parallel inflammatory ED.","['Doroszko, Adrian', 'Niedzielska, Ewa', 'Jakubowski, Maciej', 'Porwolik, Julita', 'Turek-Jakubowska, Aleksandra', 'Szahidewicz-Krupska, Ewa', 'Mazur, Grzegorz', 'Chybicka, Alicja', 'Szuba, Andrzej']","['Doroszko A', 'Niedzielska E', 'Jakubowski M', 'Porwolik J', 'Turek-Jakubowska A', 'Szahidewicz-Krupska E', 'Mazur G', 'Chybicka A', 'Szuba A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Division of Angiology, Faculty of Health Science, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20160601,Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,"['0 (Endothelium-Dependent Relaxing Factors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '63CV1GEK3Y (N,N-dimethylarginine)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Arginine/*analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Endothelial Cells/*drug effects', 'Endothelium-Dependent Relaxing Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Risk Factors']",,,2016/06/24 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/06/24 06:00'],"['2016/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1203720 [pii]', '10.5604/17322693.1203720 [doi]']",epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2016 Jun 1;70(0):562-71. doi: 10.5604/17322693.1203720.,10.5604/17322693.1203720 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VD deficiency is the first potentially modifiable prognostic factor in CLL. Currently, however, there is a lack of studies concerning VD supplementation in CLL patients. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of VD supplementation in patients with CLL. METHODS: A 6-month interventional study was conducted in CLL patients with lower serum 25-OH-D3 concentrations (< 30 ng/ml) than currently recommended. Patients with VD insufficiency (20-30 ng/ml) received 2000 IU of cholecalciferol/day, patients with moderate deficiency (10-19.9 ng/ml) received 4000 IU/day, and patients with severe VD deficiency (<10 ng/ml) received 6000 IU/day. RESULTS: In the analyzed group of 13 CLL subjects, only 1 patient had a VD level within the optimal range (30-80 ng/ml), 7 had an insufficient concentration, 4 had moderate deficiency, and 1 had severe deficiency. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was diagnosed in 4 subjects. Cholecalciferol supplementation (mean dose of 3384 +/- 1211 IU) was followed by a significant increase in 25-OH-D3 concentration (from 17.3 +/- 5.8 to 41.4 +/- 17.5 ng/ml; p<0.05) and decrease in PTH (p<0.05). Five patients did not achieve the recommended 25-OH-D3 concentration. Calcium level remained unchanged and no patients developed hypercalcemia. CONCLUSIONS: VD replenishment is safe and can be effectively achieved by means of the employed cholecalciferol dosage in the majority of patients. However, some subjects may require higher doses to obtain the optimal level and immune function.","['Kubeczko, Marcin', 'Nowara, Elzbieta', 'Spychalowicz, Wojciech', 'Wdowiak, Kamil', 'Bednarek, Anna', 'Karwasiecka, Dobromila', 'Chudek, Jerzy', 'Wojnar, Jerzy']","['Kubeczko M', 'Nowara E', 'Spychalowicz W', 'Wdowiak K', 'Bednarek A', 'Karwasiecka D', 'Chudek J', 'Wojnar J']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Oncological Chemotherapy, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Clinical and Experimental Oncology Department, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Oncological Chemotherapy, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Oncological Chemotherapy, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Oncological Chemotherapy, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Oncological Chemotherapy, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Oncological Chemotherapy, School of Medicine in Katowice, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Study', 'Journal Article']",20160521,Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,"['1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cholecalciferol/*therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary/complications', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Safety', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vitamin D/blood', 'Vitamin D Deficiency/complications/*drug therapy']",,,2016/06/24 06:00,2017/07/29 06:00,['2016/06/24 06:00'],"['2016/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1202482 [pii]', '10.5604/17322693.1202482 [doi]']",epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2016 May 21;70(0):534-41. doi: 10.5604/17322693.1202482.,10.5604/17322693.1202482 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the contribution of the umbilical cord blood graft to long-term transplant outcome remains unclear. We analyzed 39 recipients of haplo-cord transplants with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), engrafted and in remission at 2 months. Median age was 66 (18-72) and all had intermediate, high, or very-high risk disease. Less than 20% UCB chimerism in the CD33 lineage was associated with an increased rate of disease recurrence (54% versus 11% p < 0.0001) and decrease in one year progression-free (20% versus 55%, p = 0.004) and overall survival (30% versus 62%, p = 0.02). Less than 100% UCB chimerism in the CD3 lineage was associated with increase rate of disease recurrence (46% versus 12%, p = 0.007). Persistent haplo-chimerism in the CD3 lineage was associated with an increased rate of disease recurrence (40% versus 15%, p = 0.009) Chimerism did not predict for treatment related mortality. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD by day 100 was 43%. The cumulative incidence of moderate/severe chronic GVHD was only 5%. Engraftment of the umbilical cord blood grafts provides powerful graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects which protect against disease recurrence and is associated with low risk of chronic GVHD. Engraftment of CD34 selected haplo-identical cells can lead to rapid development of circulating T-cells, but when these cells dominate, GVL-effects are limited and rates of disease recurrence are high.","['van Besien, Koen', 'Koshy, Nebu', 'Gergis, Usama', 'Mayer, Sebastian', 'Cushing, Melissa', 'Rennert, Hannah', 'Reich-Slotky, Ronit', 'Mark, Tomer', 'Pearse, Roger', 'Rossi, Adriana', 'Phillips, Adrienne', 'Vasovic, Liljana', 'Ferrante, Rosanna', 'Hsu, Yen-Michael', 'Shore, Tsiporah']","['van Besien K', 'Koshy N', 'Gergis U', 'Mayer S', 'Cushing M', 'Rennert H', 'Reich-Slotky R', 'Mark T', 'Pearse R', 'Rossi A', 'Phillips A', 'Vasovic L', 'Ferrante R', 'Hsu YM', 'Shore T']","['a Division of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.', 'a Division of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.', 'a Division of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.', 'a Division of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.', 'b Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.', 'b Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.', 'b Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.', 'a Division of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.', 'a Division of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.', 'a Division of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.', 'a Division of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.', 'b Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.', 'a Division of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.', 'b Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.', 'a Division of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College , NY , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160623,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/immunology', '*Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Clinical results; leukemias and dysplasias; marrow and stem cell', 'transplantation; myeloid; neoplasia; transplantation; umbilical cord blood']",2016/06/24 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/06/24 06:00'],"['2016/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2016.1190970 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2017 Feb;58(2):288-297. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2016.1190970.

However, in solid tumors, the full potential of CAR T cell therapy is limited by the availability of cell surface antigens with sufficient cancer-specific expression. The majority of CAR targets have been normal self-antigens on dispensable hematopoietic tissues or overexpressed shared antigens. Here, we established that abnormal self-antigens can serve as targets for tumor rejection. We developed a CAR that recognized cancer-associated Tn glycoform of MUC1, a neoantigen expressed in a variety of cancers. Anti-Tn-MUC1 CAR T cells demonstrated target-specific cytotoxicity and successfully controlled tumor growth in xenograft models of T cell leukemia and pancreatic cancer.

Here we show that the ligand I-CBP112 can stimulate nucleosome acetylation up to 3-fold while CBP30 does not. Activation of p300/CBP by I-CBP112 is not observed with the isolated histone H3 substrate but requires a nucleosome substrate. I-CBP112 does not impact nucleosome acetylation by the isolated p300 HAT domain, and the effects of I-CBP112 on p300/CBP can be neutralized by CBP30, suggesting that I-CBP112 likely allosterically activates p300/CBP through bromodomain interactions. Using mass spectrometry and Western blots, we have found that I-CBP112 particularly stimulates acetylation of Lys18 of histone H3 (H3K18) in nucleosomes, an established in vivo site of p300/CBP. In addition, we show that I-CBP112 enhances H3K18 acetylation in acute leukemia and prostate cancer cells in a concentration range commensurate with its antiproliferative effects. Our findings extend the known pharmacology of bromodomain ligands in the regulation of p300/CBP and suggest a novel approach to modulating histone acetylation in cancer.","['Zucconi, Beth E', 'Luef, Birgit', 'Xu, Wei', 'Henry, Ryan A', 'Nodelman, Ilana M', 'Bowman, Gregory D', 'Andrews, Andrew J', 'Cole, Philip A']","['Zucconi BE', 'Luef B', 'Xu W', 'Henry RA', 'Nodelman IM', 'Bowman GD', 'Andrews AJ', 'Cole PA']","['Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland 21205, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland 21205, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland 21205, United States.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Fox Chase Cancer Center , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111, United States.', 'Department of Biophysics, Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore, Maryland 21218, United States.', 'Department of Biophysics, Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore, Maryland 21218, United States.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Fox Chase Cancer Center , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine , Baltimore, Maryland 21205, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160701,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Bromine Compounds)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Bromine Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",,,2016/06/23 06:00,2017/05/05 06:00,['2016/06/23 06:00'],"['2016/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00480 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2016 Jul 12;55(27):3727-34. doi: 10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00480.

Here, we develop a technique in which precise changes in the cellular volume can be conveniently introduced by varying the voltage applied across a Nafion membrane that separates the culture medium from a reservoir. It is found that, unlike sudden osmotic shocks, active ion transport across the membrane of leukemia K562 cells will not be triggered by a gradual change in the extracellular osmolarity. Furthermore, when subjected to the same applied voltage, different lung and nasopharyngeal epithelial cancer cells will undergo larger volumetric changes and have a 5-10% higher death rate compared to their normal counterparts. We show that such distinct response is largely caused by the overexpression of aquaporin-4 in tumor cells, with knockout of this water channel protein resulting in a markedly reduced change in the cellular volume. Finally, by taking into account the exchange of water/ion molecules across the Nafion film and the cell membrane, a theoretical model is also proposed to describe the voltage-induced size changes of cells, which explain our experimental observations very well.","['Hui, Tsz Hin', 'Kwan, Kin Wah', 'Chun Yip, Timothy Tak', 'Fong, Hong Wai', 'Ngan, Kai Cheong', 'Yu, Miao', 'Yao, Shuhuai', 'Wan Ngan, Alfonso Hin', 'Lin, Yuan']","['Hui TH', 'Kwan KW', 'Chun Yip TT', 'Fong HW', 'Ngan KC', 'Yu M', 'Yao S', 'Wan Ngan AH', 'Lin Y']","['Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China; HKU-Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation (HKU-SIRI), Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Bioengineering Graduate Program, Biomedical Engineering Division, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Bioengineering Graduate Program, Biomedical Engineering Division, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR, China; Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.

Several FLT3 inhibitors are undergoing investigation, while their clinical efficacies were lower than expected and several resistant mechanisms to FLT3 inhibitors have been demonstrated. Although most AML cells harboring FLT3 mutation co-express wild-type (Wt)-FLT3, it is not fully understood how Wt-FLT3 expression is associated with the resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. In this study, we elucidated a resistant mechanism by which FL-dependent Wt-FLT3 activation reduced inhibitory effects of FLT3 inhibitors. We demonstrated that FL-stimulation much more strongly reduced growth inhibitory effects of FLT3 inhibitors on Wt- and mutant-FLT3 co-expressing cells than sole mutant-FLT3 expressing cells both in vitro and in vivo. It was also confirmed that FL impaired the anti-leukemia effects of FLT3 inhibitors on primary AML cells. We elucidated that FL impeded the inhibitory effects of FLT3 inhibitors mainly through the activation of Wt-FLT3, but not mutated FLT3, in the Wt- and ITD-FLT3 co-expressing cells. Furthermore, FL-induced activation of Wt-FLT3-MAPK axis was the dominant pathway for the resistance, and the glycosylation of Wt-FLT3 was also vital for FL-dependent kinase activation and following resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. Thus, we clarified the importance of co-expressing Wt-FLT3 in resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. These findings provide us with important implications for clinical application and new strategies to improve clinical outcomes of FLT3 inhibitors.","['Chen, Fangli', 'Ishikawa, Yuichi', 'Akashi, Akimi', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi']","['Chen F', 'Ishikawa Y', 'Akashi A', 'Naoe T', 'Kiyoi H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology Research, National Hospital Organization, Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Domains/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FLT3 inhibitor', 'FLT3 ligand', 'Wt-FLT3', 'resistance']",2016/06/23 06:00,2018/01/05 06:00,['2016/06/23 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10147 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10147 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 26;7(30):47018-47032. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10147.,10.18632/oncotarget.10147 [doi],,PMC5216920,"['Y.I. received research founding from Glaxo Smithkline Japan, H.

Responding to an RA-induced cytosolic signaling machine, c-Raf translocates to the nucleus, providing propulsion for RA-induced differentiation. This novel mechanism is not understood, but presumably reflects c-Raf binding with nuclear gene regulatory proteins. RRD-251 is a small molecule that prevents the interaction of c-Raf and RB, the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein. The involvement of c-Raf and RB in RA-induced differentiation motivates interest in the effects of combined RA and RRD-251 treatment on leukemic cell differentiation. We demonstrate that RRD-251 enhances RA-induced differentiation. Mechanistically, we find that nuclear translocated c-Raf associates with pS608 RB. RA causes loss of pS608 RB, where cells with hypophosphorylated S608 RB are G0/G1 restricted. Corroborating the pS608 RB hypophosphorylation, RB sequestration of E2F increased with concomitant loss of cdc6 expression, which is known to be driven by E2F. Hypophosphorylation of S608 RB releases c-Raf from RB sequestration to bind other nuclear targets. Release of c-Raf from RB sequestration results in enhanced association with GSK-3 which is phosphorylated at its S21/9 inhibitory sites. c-Raf binding to GSK-3 is associated with dissociation of GSK-3 and RARalpha, thereby relieving RARalpha of GSK-3 inhibition. RRD-251 amplifies each of these RA-induced events. Consistent with the posited enhancement of RARalpha transcriptional activity by RRD-251, RRD-251 increases the RARE-driven CD38 expression per cell. The RA/c-Raf/GSK-3/RARalpha axis emerges as a novel differentiation regulatory mechanism susceptible to RRD-251, suggesting enhancing RA-effects with RRD-251 in therapy.","['Wallace, Aaron S', 'Supnick, Harrison T', 'Bunaciu, Rodica P', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Wallace AS', 'Supnick HT', 'Bunaciu RP', 'Yen A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (RRD 251)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'GYV9AM2QAG (Thiourea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Thiourea/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['GSK-3', 'RRD-251', 'c-Raf', 'retinoblastoma protein (RB)', 'all-trans retinoic acid (RA)']",2016/06/23 06:00,2018/01/30 06:00,['2016/06/23 06:00'],"['2016/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10136 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10136 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 19;7(29):46401-46418. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10136.,10.18632/oncotarget.10136 [doi],"['R01 CA033505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA152870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5216806,['None of the authors have competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with isolated del(5q) MDS have a relatively favorable prognosis, with transformation to acute myeloid leukemia occurring in <10%, and their disease responds well to lenalidomide. However the optimal therapeutic approach for patients with del(5q) MDS in coexistence with the JAK2 V617F mutation, which is common to myeloproliferative neoplasms, remains to be elucidated. The present study reports a 77-year-old, transfusion-dependent female patient diagnosed with del(5q) MDS and a concomitant JAK2 V617F mutation. The patient was started on 10 mg lenalidomide daily for 21 days in a 28 day-cycle and within the first month of treatment, the patient became transfusion-independent. The only toxicity observed was grade 3 neutropenia, which was managed with transient treatment discontinuation and dose reduction on restart (5 mg). The patient achieved a complete cytogenetic and molecular response (normal karyotype and undetected JAK2 V617F mutation) within 6 months of treatment. However, 12 months post treatment initiation and while on hematological, cytogenetic and molecular response, the patient was unwilling to continue on treatment and lenalidomide was discontinued. The patient remains in hematological response, which lasts for >5 years despite treatment discontinuation. The present case highlights the coexistence of the JAK2 V617F mutation in del(5q) MDS and suggests that lenalidomide treatment is beneficial and effective for these patients, leading to complete hematological, cytogenetic and molecular response. Hematological response may be sustained for long periods of time, even following the discontinuation of the treatment.","['Hatzimichael, Eleftheria', 'Lagos, Konstantinos', 'Vassou, Amalia', 'Gougopoulou, Dora', 'Papoudou-Bai, Alexandra', 'Briasoulis, Evangelos']","['Hatzimichael E', 'Lagos K', 'Vassou A', 'Gougopoulou D', 'Papoudou-Bai A', 'Briasoulis E']","['Department of Hematology, University of Ioannina, 45110 Ioannina, Greece; Thomas Jefferson University, Computational Medicine Center, Sidney Kimmel Medical College, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Ioannina, 45110 Ioannina, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Ioannina, 45110 Ioannina, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Ioannina, 45110 Ioannina, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital of Ioannina, 45500 Ioannina, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Ioannina, 45110 Ioannina, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160420,England,Mol Clin Oncol,Molecular and clinical oncology,101613422,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['JAK2 V617F', 'del(5q)', 'lenalidomide', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",2016/06/23 06:00,2016/06/23 06:01,['2016/06/23 06:00'],"['2015/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/mco.2016.866 [doi]', 'MCO-0-0-866 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Clin Oncol. 2016 Jul;5(1):23-26. doi: 10.3892/mco.2016.866.

Halophilic and halotolerant bacteria with novel enzymatic characteristics can be considered as a potential source for production of enzymes with different immunological properties. In this study, L-asparaginase and L-glutaminase production by halophilic bacteria isolated from Urmia salt lake was studied. Out of the 85 isolated halophilic and halotolerant bacterial strains, 16 (19 %) showed L-asparaginase activity and 3 strains (3.5 %) showed L-glutaminase activity. Strains with the highest activities were selected for further studies. Based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis, it was shown that the selected isolates for L-asparaginase and L-glutaminase production belong to the genus Bacillus and Salicola, respectively. Both enzymes were produced extracellularly. The strain with the most L-asparaginase production did not show L-glutaminase production which is medically important. The effects of key parameters including temperature, initial pH of the solution, and concentrations of glucose, asparagine or glutamine, and sodium chloride were evaluated by means of response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize enzymes production.

The quality and reproducibility of sample preparation can determine the coverage and confidence of proteomics results. Up to date, several methodologies have been described to produce suitable peptides for mass spectrometry analysis, followed by strategies for enrichment of post-translational modified peptides, if desired. Among them, the filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) has been introduced as a method to allow for removal of denaturants, reductants, alkylators, lipids and nucleic acids prior to trypsin digestion. Despite the high proteolytic digestion and contaminant removal efficiency described for this method, filter failure and consequently complete sample loss can discourage the use of this approach by the proteomic community. RESULTS: As judged by our quality controls, we were able to perform reliable and reproducible FASP for mass spectrometry analysis that allowed the quantification of 2141 proteins and 3694 phosphopeptides from as little as 20 and 320 mug of protein lysate from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, respectively. Using the immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) method resulted in samples specifically enriched in phosphopeptides and allowed the quantification of a high number of both di- and multi-phosphopeptides in addition to the abundant mono-phosphopeptides. The workflows' high reproducibility from three biological replicates was demonstrated by the similar number of quantified proteins and localized phosphosites, and confirmed by the similar distributions of their molecular functions. We found that the combination of the FASP procedure with StageTip mixed-mode fractionation and IMAC are excellent workflows for the reproducible and deep study of AML proteomes and phosphoproteomes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The FASP procedure can be carried out without the risk of filter failure by performing a simple test of the filter quality before adding the protein sample. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient and reproducible FASP-based pipeline for the proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis of AML patient samples which also can be used for the analysis of any other protein samples.","['Hernandez-Valladares, Maria', 'Aasebo, Elise', 'Mjaavatten, Olav', 'Vaudel, Marc', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Berven, Frode', 'Selheim, Frode']","['Hernandez-Valladares M', 'Aasebo E', 'Mjaavatten O', 'Vaudel M', 'Bruserud O', 'Berven F', 'Selheim F']","['Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, 5009 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160621,England,Biol Proced Online,Biological procedures online,100963717,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'FASP', 'IMAC', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Phosphoproteomics', 'Proteomics', 'SILAC']",2016/06/23 06:00,2016/06/23 06:01,['2016/06/23 06:00'],"['2016/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12575-016-0043-0 [doi]', '43 [pii]']",epublish,Biol Proced Online. 2016 Jun 21;18:13. doi: 10.1186/s12575-016-0043-0. eCollection 2016.,10.1186/s12575-016-0043-0 [doi],,PMC4915068,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lasso regularization and meta-analysis identify a unique set of gene features for subtype characterization. An additional pattern matching reward function guarantees consistent subtype signatures across studies. The method was evaluated by simulations and leukemia and breast cancer data sets. The identified disease subtypes from meta-analysis were characterized with improved accuracy and stability compared to single study analysis.

Nevertheless, patterns of inheritance and the importance of genetic versus environmental risk factors in MM aetiology remain unclear. We pooled data from eleven case-control studies from the International Multiple Myeloma Consortium to characterize the association of MM risk with having a first-degree relative with a history of a lympho-haematapoietic cancer. Unconditional logistic regression models, adjusted for study, sex, age and education level, were used to estimate associations between MM risk and having a first-degree relative with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, leukaemia or MM. Sex, African American race/ethnicity and age were explored as effect modifiers. A total of 2843 cases and 11 470 controls were included. MM risk was elevated in association with having a first-degree relative with any lympho-haematapoietic cancer (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.29, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.08-1.55). The association was particularly strong for having a first-degree relative with MM (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.26-2.87), especially among men (OR = 4.13, 95% CI: 2.17-7.85) and African Americans (OR = 5.52, 95% CI: 1.87-16.27).These results support the hypothesis that genetic inheritance plays a role in MM aetiology.

In this study we show that FLT3 activation inhibits the activity of the tumor suppressor, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Using BaF3 cells transduced with wildtype or mutant FLT3, we show that FLT3-induced PP2A inhibition sensitizes cells to the pharmacological PP2A activators, FTY720 and AAL(S). FTY720 and AAL(S) induced cell death and inhibited colony formation of FLT3 activated cells. Furthermore, PP2A activators reduced the phosphorylation of ERK and AKT, downstream targets shared by both FLT3 and PP2A, in FLT3/ITD+ BaF3 and MV4-11 cell lines. PP2A activity was lower in primary human bone marrow derived AML blasts compared to normal bone marrow, with blasts from FLT3-ITD patients displaying lower PP2A activity than WT-FLT3 blasts. Reduced PP2A activity was associated with hyperphosphorylation of the PP2A catalytic subunit, and reduced expression of PP2A structural and regulatory subunits. AML patient blasts were also sensitive to cell death induced by FTY720 and AAL(S), but these compounds had minimal effect on normal CD34+ bone marrow derived monocytes. Finally, PP2A activating compounds displayed synergistic effects when used in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in FLT3-ITD+ cells. A combination of Sorafenib and FTY720 was also synergistic in the presence of a protective stromal microenvironment. Thus combining a PP2A activating compound and a FLT3 inhibitor may be a novel therapeutic approach for treating AML.","['Smith, Amanda M', 'Dun, Matthew D', 'Lee, Erwin M', 'Harrison, Celeste', 'Kahl,

BMI1P1 was significantly down-regulated in AML compared with control (P < 0.001). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that BMI1P1 expression could differentiate patients with AML from control subjects (AUC = 0.895, 95% CI: 0.835-0.954, P < 0.001). The percentage of blasts in bone marrow (BM) was significantly lower in BMI1P1 high-expressed group versus low-expressed group (P = 0.008). BMI1P1 high-expressed cases had significantly higher complete remission (CR) than BMI1P1 low-expressed cases (P = 0.023). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier demonstrated that both whole AML cohort and non-M3-AML patients with low BMI1P1 expression showed shorter leukemia free survival (LFS, P = 0.002 and P = 0.01, respectively) and overall survival (OS, P < 0.001 and P = 0.011, respectively) than those with high BMI1P1 expression. Multivariate analysis also showed that BMI1P1 over-expression was an independent favorable prognostic factor for OS in both whole and non-M3 cohort of AML patients (HR = 0.462, 95% CI = 0.243-0.879, P = 0.019 and HR = 0.483, 95% CI = 0.254-0.919, P = 0.027). To further investigate the significance of BMI1P1 expression in the follow-up of AML patients, we monitored the BMI1P1 level in 26 de novo AML patients and found that the BMI1P1 level increased significantly from the initial diagnosis to post-CR (P < 0.001).

Consequently, the development of adjuvant therapies that increase efficacy while reducing morbidities is important. Reducing the concentration of the toxic drugs in adjuvant therapy has the potential to reduce unwanted side effects. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the synergistic effects of fucoidan, an anti-tumor agent, with current APL therapies.When the human APL cell line, NB4, was treated in vitro with fucoidan plus ATO and ATRA at therapeutic and sub-therapeutic doses, there was an increase in sub-G0/G1 cells, annexin V/PI-positive-apoptotic cells and DNA fragmentation. This reduction in proliferation and increase in apoptosis was accompanied by enhanced myeloid differentiation as indicated by an increased expression of CD11b. This was not observed with the AML cell line Kasumi-1, suggesting specificity for APL.In vivo treatment of APL-bearing mice with fucoidan+ATRA or fucoidan+ATO delayed tumor growth, induced differentiation and increased tumor volume doubling time. The differentiated APL cells derived from the excised tumor mass exhibited decreased CD44 expression in fucoidan+ATRA treated mice. This could translate to decreased cell migration in APL patients.Our findings provide evidence supporting the use of fucoidan as an adjuvant therapeutic agent in the treatment of APL.","['Atashrazm, Farzaneh', 'Lowenthal, Ray M', 'Dickinson, Joanne L', 'Holloway, Adele F', 'Woods, Gregory M']","['Atashrazm F', 'Lowenthal RM', 'Dickinson JL', 'Holloway AF', 'Woods GM']","['Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7000, Australia.', 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7000, Australia.', 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7000, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7000, Australia.', 'Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7000, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania 7000, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9072-19-9 (fucoidan)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Polysaccharides/administration & dosage', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'ATRA', 'arsenic trioxide', 'fucoidan', 'synergy']",2016/06/23 06:00,2018/01/09 06:00,['2016/06/23 06:00'],"['2016/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10016 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10016 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 19;7(29):46028-46041. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10016.,10.18632/oncotarget.10016 [doi],,PMC5216779,['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to observe the effects in vivo, a xenograft model of human myeloma was established. Quercetin inhibited proliferation of MM cells (RPMI8226, ARP-1, and MM.1R) by inducing cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and apoptosis. Western blot showed that quercetin downregulated c-myc expression and upregulated p21 expression. Quercetin also activated caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1. Caspase inhibitors partially blocked apoptosis induced by quercetin. Furthermore, quercetin combined with dexamethasone significantly increased MM cell apoptosis. In vivo xenograft models, quercetin obviously inhibited tumor growth. Caspase-3 was activated to a greater extent when quercetin was combined with dexamethasone.

Here, we report the crystal structure of MoMLV RT in complex with eRF1. The MoMLV RT interacts with the C-terminal domain of eRF1 via its RNase H domain to sterically occlude the binding of peptidyl release factor 3 (eRF3) to eRF1. Promotion of read-through by MoMLV RNase H prevents nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) of mRNAs. Comparison of our structure with that of HIV RT explains why HIV RT cannot interact with eRF1. Our results provide a mechanistic view of how MoMLV manipulates the host translation termination machinery for the synthesis of its own proteins.","['Tang, Xuhua', 'Zhu, Yiping', 'Baker, Stacey L', 'Bowler, Matthew W', 'Chen, Benjamin Jieming', 'Chen, Chen', 'Hogg, J Robert', 'Goff, Stephen P', 'Song, Haiwei']","['Tang X', 'Zhu Y', 'Baker SL', 'Bowler MW', 'Chen BJ', 'Chen C', 'Hogg JR', 'Goff SP', 'Song H']","['Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, 61 Biopolis Drive, Proteos, Singapore 138673, Singapore.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, HHSC 1310C, 701 West 168th Street, New York, New York 10032, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, HHSC 1310C, 701 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Biochemistry and Biophysics Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, 50 South Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Grenoble Outstation, 71 Avenue des Martyrs, CS 90181, Grenoble F-38042, France.', 'Unit of Virus Host-Cell Interactions, University Grenoble Alpes-EMBL-CNRS, 71 Avenue des Martyrs, CS 90181, Grenoble F-38042, France.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, 61 Biopolis Drive, Proteos, Singapore 138673, Singapore.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, 61 Biopolis Drive, Proteos, Singapore 138673, Singapore.', 'Biochemistry and Biophysics Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, 50 South Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University, HHSC 1310C, 701 West 168th Street, New York, New York 10032, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Columbia University, HHSC 1310C, 701 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, 61 Biopolis Drive, Proteos, Singapore 138673, Singapore.', 'Life Sciences Institute, Zhejiang University, 388 Yuhangtang Road, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry, National University of Singapore, 14 Science Drive, Singapore 117543, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160622,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Codon, Terminator)', '0 (Etf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (Peptide Termination Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (peptide-chain-release factor 3)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calorimetry', 'Codon, Terminator', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay', '*Peptide Chain Termination, Translational', 'Peptide Termination Factors/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/chemistry/metabolism']",,,2016/06/23 06:00,2018/09/06 06:00,['2016/06/23 06:00'],"['2015/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms12070 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms12070 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2016 Jun 22;7:12070. doi: 10.1038/ncomms12070.,10.1038/ncomms12070 [doi],['R01 CA030488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4917968,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) against BCR-ABL, imatinib, is the first-line therapy for CML, acquired resistance almost inevitably emerges. The underlying mechanism are point mutations within the BCR-ABL gene, among which T315I is notorious because it resists to almost all currently available inhibitors. Here we took use of a previously generated chimeric ubiquitin ligase, SH2-U-box, in which SH2 from the adaptor protein Grb2 acts as a binding domain for activated BCR-ABL, while U-box from CHIP functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase domain, so as to target the ubiquitination and degradation of both native and T315I-mutant BCR-ABL. As such, SH2-U-box significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in CML cells harboring either the wild-type or T315I-mutant BCR-ABL (K562 or K562R), with BCR-ABL-dependent signaling pathways being repressed. Moreover, SH2-U-box worked in concert with imatinib in K562 cells. Importantly, SH2-U-box-carrying lentivirus could markedly suppress the growth of K562-xenografts in nude mice or K562R-xenografts in SCID mice, as well as that of primary CML cells. Collectively, by degrading the native and T315I-mutant BCR-ABL, the chimeric ubiquitin ligase SH2-U-box may serve as a potential therapy for both imatinib-sensitive and resistant CML.","['Ru, Yi', 'Wang, Qinhao', 'Liu, Xiping', 'Zhang, Mei', 'Zhong, Daixing', 'Ye, Mingxiang', 'Li, Yuanchun', 'Han, Hua', 'Yao, Libo', 'Li, Xia']","['Ru Y', 'Wang Q', 'Liu X', 'Zhang M', 'Zhong D', 'Ye M', 'Li Y', 'Han H', 'Yao L', 'Li X']","[""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710032, China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710032, China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710032, China."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Zunyi Medical College, Zunyi, Guizhou 563000, China.', ""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710032, China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tangdu Hospital, the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710038, China."", ""Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710032, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Tangdu Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710038, China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710032, China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710032, China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710032, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160622,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (STUB1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein/chemistry', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Point Mutation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/chemistry', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'src Homology Domains']",,,2016/06/23 06:00,2018/05/31 06:00,['2016/06/23 06:00'],"['2016/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [medline]']","['srep28352 [pii]', '10.1038/srep28352 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Jun 22;6:28352. doi: 10.1038/srep28352.,10.1038/srep28352 [doi],,PMC4916441,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lenalidomide has been proved to be effective for relapsed/refractory CLL as a single agent or in combination with various chemo-immunotherapeutic regimens. However, current clinical experience in its usage is still limited. Because of existing considerable variability in different studies, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to describe overall response rate (ORR) of lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Pooled estimate of cumulative prevalence of total ORR was 42.23 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 32.49-52.61 %), while pooled ORR in regimen with lenalidomide plus anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAbs) and lenalidomide mono-therapy were 60.01 % (95 % CI, 53.86-65.86 %) and 24.38 % (95 % CI, 16.15-35.06 %), respectively. There was no significant difference between L + R (lenalidomide plus rituximab) group and L + O (lenalidomide plus ofatumumab) group, with pooled ORR of 66.38 % (95 % CI, 57.96-73.87 %) and 57.40 % (95 % CI, 46.46-67.65 %), respectively. When co-administrated with anti-CD20 mAbs, dosage of lenalidomide was not the key factor of ORR in combination therapy. Pooled ORR of patient with high-risk cytogenetic in L + anti-CD20 mAbs group was 56.74 % (95 % CI, 45.53-67.30 %). In comparison with patients without high-risk cytogenetic receiving the same treatment regimen, no significant difference was observed, with relative risk (RR) of 0.87 (95 % CI 0.68-1.11). Our finding demonstrated that lenalidomide plus anti-CD20 mAbs could be an efficient therapy regimen for relapsed/refractory CLL patients, especially for those with high-risk cytogenetic factor.","['Liang, Liang', 'Zhao, Ming', 'Zhu, Yuan-Chao', 'Hu, Xin', 'Yang, Li-Ping', 'Liu, Hui']","['Liang L', 'Zhao M', 'Zhu YC', 'Hu X', 'Yang LP', 'Liu H']","['Department of Pharmacy, Assessment of Clinical Drugs Risk and Individual Application Key Laboratory, Beijing Hospital, Beijing, 100730, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Assessment of Clinical Drugs Risk and Individual Application Key Laboratory, Beijing Hospital, Beijing, 100730, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Assessment of Clinical Drugs Risk and Individual Application Key Laboratory, Beijing Hospital, Beijing, 100730, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Assessment of Clinical Drugs Risk and Individual Application Key Laboratory, Beijing Hospital, Beijing, 100730, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Assessment of Clinical Drugs Risk and Individual Application Key Laboratory, Beijing Hospital, Beijing, 100730, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing Hospital, Beijing, 100730, China. liuhui8140@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160621,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Recurrence', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage', 'Thalidomide/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Lenalidomide', 'Meta-analysis', 'Relapsed/refractory']",2016/06/23 06:00,2017/02/06 06:00,['2016/06/23 06:00'],"['2015/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2719-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2719-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Sep;95(9):1473-82. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2719-6.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether healthy and BLV infected cattle elicited similar humoral responses after foot and mouth disease (FMD) immunization. In a field study, 35 Holstein heifers were selected based on their BLV serological status and immunized with a single dose of a commercial bivalent oil-based FMD vaccine. Serum samples were collected at 0, 15, 60, 165 and 300 days post vaccination (dpv). RESULTS: Total anti-A24/Cruzeiro antibodies, IgM, IgG1, IgG2 titers and avidity index of specific antibodies were determined by ELISA. Although only marginally significant differences were found between groups in terms of total antibodies, anti-FMD IgM and IgG1 titers were significantly lower in heifers infected with BLV at the 15 dpv (p < 0.01). Animals that became infected during the study did not show differences to the BLV negative group.

We evaluated the efficacy of prophylactic administration of voriconazole (VRCZ) with two different doses. METHODS: Between October 2005 and June 2011, 17 children and adolescents (aged 0-20 years) undergoing chemotherapy for AML were prophylactically administered with 5 mg/kg/d of oral VRCZ. Furthermore, 22 AML patients (aged 0-19 years) were administered 10 mg/kg/d of oral VRCZ between July 2011 and December 2014. The incidences of IFI with two different doses of VRCZ were compared. RESULTS: Irrespective of the dosage of VRCZ, eight patients developed IFI. Of these eight patients, four belonged to the 5 mg/kg/d group and four to the 10 mg/kg/d group. Cumulative incidences of IFI at 180 days after the initiation of chemotherapy were not different between the 5 mg/kg/d and 10 mg/kg/d groups. The trough plasma VRCZ concentration in the 10 mg/kg/d group ranged from < 0.09 mug/mL to 2.17 mug/mL, with a median level of 0.27 mug/mL, and patients with the targeted trough concentration (1-4 mug/mL) comprised only 18.8% of the evaluable patients in this group, whereas the trough plasma VRCZ concentration of the evaluable patients in the 5 mg/kg/d group were all below the limit of sensitivity (< 0.09 mug/mL). CONCLUSION: More dose escalation is required based on this study. As VRCZ concentration is considerably influenced by genetic polymorphisms and drug-drug interactions, VRCZ should be used under therapeutic drug monitoring to keep effective drug concentrations.","['Sano, Hirozumi', 'Kobayashi, Ryoji', 'Hori, Daiki', 'Kishimoto, Kenji', 'Suzuki, Daisuke', 'Yasuda, Kazue', 'Kobayashi, Kunihiko']","['Sano H', 'Kobayashi R', 'Hori D', 'Kishimoto K', 'Suzuki D', 'Yasuda K', 'Kobayashi K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.

We retrospectively analyzed 659 patients with aggressive ATL in seven institutions in Okinawa between 2002 and 2011. The median patient age was 68 years. More patients were aged >/=90 years (2.6 %), in this study, than in a nationwide survey (<1 %). The median survival time (MST) of the entire cohort was 6.5 months. Of the 217 patients who had a clinical status similar to that stated in the eligibility criteria of JCOG9801 (a randomized phase III study comparing VCAP-AMP-VECP with CHOP-14), 147 who received the CHOP regimen had a poorer MST than those in the CHOP-14 arm of JCOG9801 (8 vs 11 months). The prevalence of strongyloidiasis in the ATL patients was much higher (12.4 %) than in the historical cohort who visited the University of the Ryukyus Hospital (3.4 %). Furthermore, strongyloidiasis may be associated with ATL-related deaths. These findings suggest that, compared with other areas in Japan, in Okinawa, the proportion of patients aged >/=90 years with clinical features of aggressive ATL is higher, outcomes are poorer, and the disease is associated with a higher prevalence of strongyloidiasis.","['Nishi, Yukiko', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Nomura, Shogo', 'Tomoyose, Takeaki', 'Nakachi, Sawako', 'Morichika, Kazuho', 'Tedokon,

The vinca alkaloid vincristine is a standard component of chemotherapy regimens used to treat ALL, because of its well-defined mechanism of action, demonstrated anticancer activity, and ability to be combined with other agents. However, the dosage of vincristine is frequently capped because of neurotoxicity concerns, and patients with large body surface areas are, therefore, almost always underdosed. Liposomal formulations have the ability to ""passively"" accumulate at sites of increased vasculature permeability and reduce the adverse effects of encapsulated relative to free drug. Vincristine sulfate liposome injection (VSLI) is a sphingomyelin/cholesterol-based liposome-encapsulated formulation that is delivered weekly in a 1-hour infusion. Based on the pharmacokinetics of the liposomal delivery system, vincristine is slowly released from the liposome and delivered into the tissues more efficiently than with the standard preparation, allowing a higher dose. This increase in therapeutic index from reduced toxicity is a valuable difference between the two formulations. VSLI is indicated for the treatment of adults with second or greater relapse and clinically advanced Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL. For the first time, studies will be able to exploit the delivery of higher and uncapped doses of vincristine in randomized studies comparing first-line chemotherapy with standard vincristine versus VSLI in both ALL and lymphoma to determine whether VSLI is superior to conventional vincristine. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This review summarizes the development of vincristine sulfate liposome injection, a new formulation of vincristine. The pharmacokinetics of liposomal drug delivery are examined, the limitations and advantages of conventional and liposomal vincristine are compared, and the use of vincristine sulfate liposome injection in clinical trials and case studies is included. Clinicians will be informed of a new chemotherapy agent that is indicated for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia, whose disease has relapsed two or more times or whose leukemia has progressed after two or more regimens of antileukemia therapy.","['Douer, Dan']",['Douer D'],"['Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA douer_d@med.usc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20160621,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Liposomes)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Liposome', '*Marqibo', '*Pharmacokinetics', '*Vincristine', '*Vincristine sulfate liposome injection']",2016/06/23 06:00,2017/11/02 06:00,['2016/06/23 06:00'],"['2015/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2015-0391 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0391 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2016 Jul;21(7):840-7. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0391.

Survivors of leukemia, brain tumors, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are more likely to develop obesity resulting from treatment modalities such as radiotherapy and glucocorticoids. This paper analyzes and integrates the current data available to health professionals in order to clarify strategies that can be used to treat and prevent obesity in childhood cancer survivors. SOURCES: This is a literature review from on scientifically reliable electronic databases. We selected articles published in the last five years and earlier articles of great scientific importance. DATA SYNTHESIS: The mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of obesity in cancer survivors are not completely understood, but it is believed that damage to the hypothalamus and endocrine disorders such as insulin resistance, leptin resistance, and hormone deficiency may be involved. The body composition of this group includes a predominance of adipose tissue, especially in those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant and total body irradiation. The use of body mass index in these patients may lead to an underestimation of individuals' risk for metabolic complications. CONCLUSION: Early identification of groups using accurate anthropometric assessments, interventional treatment, and/or preventative measures and counseling is essential to minimize the adverse effects of treatment. Physical activity and healthy eating to promote adequacy of weight in the whole population should be encouraged.","['Teixeira, Julia Ferrari Carneiro', 'Maia-Lemos, Priscila Dos Santos', 'Cypriano, Monica Dos Santos', 'Pisani, Luciana Pellegrini']","['Teixeira JF', 'Maia-Lemos PD', 'Cypriano MD', 'Pisani LP']","['Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Programa de Pos-graduacao em Alimentos, Nutricao e Saude, Santos, SP, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Oncologia Pediatrica/Grupo de Apoio ao Adolescente e a Crianca com Cancer (IOP/GRAACC), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Oncologia Pediatrica/Grupo de Apoio ao Adolescente e a Crianca com Cancer (IOP/GRAACC), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Departamento de Biociencias, Santos, SP, Brazil.

Conversely, p53 mutations are rare in leukemias and are only observed in a small fraction of the patient population, predominately in patients with complex karyotype acute myeloid leukemia or hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the loss of p53 function in leukemic cells is often caused by abnormalities in p53-regulatory proteins, including overexpression of MDM2/MDMX, deletion of CDKN2A/ARF, and alterations in ATM. For example, MDM2 inhibits p53-mediated transcription, promotes its nuclear export, and induces proteasome-dependent degradation. The MDM2 homolog MDMX is another direct regulator of p53 that inhibits p53-mediated transcription. Several small-molecule inhibitors and stapled peptides targeting MDM2 and MDMX have been developed and have recently entered clinical trials. The clinical trial results of the first clinically used MDM2 inhibitor, RG7112, illustrated promising p53 activation and apoptosis induction in leukemia cells as proof of concept.

These reagents exploit the mechanism by which T cell receptors (TCR) on cytotoxic CD8 T cells recognize specific antigens in the context of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule during antigen presentation. MHC-multimers are fluorescently-labeled dextran polymers that carry MHC Class I molecules and peptide sequences that can be modified to represent specific cognate sequences of the antigen of interest with dextramers having a 10-fold multiplicity of the MHC/peptide combination within a single multimer. Since the binding of antigen-specific dextramers mimics antigen presentation to the TCR, the present study sought to determine whether this TCR engagement on the AST was sufficient to elicit a functional T cell response. The effect of binding of CMV specific dextramers on the activation of the NFAT signal transduction cascade was assessed in peripheral blood from bone marrow transplant recipients previously determined to be positive for CMV-ASTs (CASTs). NFAT activation was quantified by measuring nuclear translocation of NFAT1 in CD8+ CASTs and CD8+ non-CASTs by imaging flow cytometry. Our results demonstrate that an increase in the nuclear localization of NFAT1 was detectable in the CASTs following the CMV-dextramer binding and could be observed as early as 10min post-exposure. The NFAT1 activation correlated with a downstream functional response in the form of interferon gamma production. Sample preparation, temperature, and duration of dextramer exposure were important parameters affecting the dextramer-induced NFAT activation with 2h exposure in whole blood at room temperature being the optimal of the conditions tested. Intra- and inter-individual heterogeneity was observed with regards to the NFAT activation in the CASTs. Importantly, no effect of the dextramers was observed in the CD8+ non-CASTs, and therefore dextramer negative cell populations. Exposure to PMA/ionomycin following dextramer exposure resulted in a homogeneous NFAT activation in both the dextramer-positive but NFAT1 nonresponsive CAST and non-CAST cells. Thus, the data demonstrate that binding of antigen-specific dextramers to ASTs specifically results in activation of NFAT, that the NFAT activation correlates with a downstream functional response and that the response can be heterogeneous. This functional parameter may provide insight to the issue whether enumeration alone of ASTs is a sufficient parameter to assess an individual's immune status against a specific antigen.","['Maguire, Orla', 'Chen, George L', 'Hahn, Theresa E', 'Brix, Liselotte', 'McCarthy, Philip L', 'Wallace, Paul K', 'Minderman, Hans']","['Maguire O', 'Chen GL', 'Hahn TE', 'Brix L', 'McCarthy PL', 'Wallace PK', 'Minderman H']","['Department of Flow and Image Cytometry, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow specimens were collected from 36 patients with CLL. CLL cells were cultured with CpG-ODN type DSP30 plus IL-2 for 72 h, following which R-banding analysis was conducted. Conventional culture without the immunostimulant served as the control group. The incidence of genetic abnormalities was measured by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using a panel of five specific probes: D13S25 (13q14.3), RB1 (13q14), P53 (17p13), ATM (11q22.3) and CSP12 (trisomy 12, +12). RESULTS: In the control group, chromosome analysis achieved a success rate of only 22.2, and 11.1% of abnormal karyotypes were detected. After immunostimulation with DSP30 plus IL-2, chromosome analysis achieved a success rate of up to 91.6, and 41.6% of abnormal karyotypes were detected. FISH analysis detected 77.7% of abnormalities. FISH combined with CpG-ODN DSP30 plus IL-2 improved the detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities in CLL to 83.3%. CONCLUSION: CpG-ODN DSP30 combined with IL-2 is effective in improving the detection rate of chromosomal abnormalities in CLL cells. This combination with FISH analysis is conducive to increasing the detection rate of genetic abnormalities in CLL.","['Lin, Xiaolan', 'Chen, Jiadi', 'Huang, Huifang']","['Lin X', 'Chen J', 'Huang H']","['a Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology , Fujian Medical University Union Hospital , Fujian , China.', 'a Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology , Fujian Medical University Union Hospital , Fujian , China.', 'a Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology , Fujian Medical University Union Hospital , Fujian , China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160621,England,Br J Biomed Sci,British journal of biomedical science,9309208,"['0 (CpG-ODN DSP30)', '0 (IL2 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oligonucleotides']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'CpG oligodeoxynucleotide', 'cytogenetics', 'immunostimulation', 'interleukin-2', 'karyotype']",2016/06/22 06:00,2017/01/14 06:00,['2016/06/22 06:00'],"['2016/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09674845.2016.1188970 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Biomed Sci. 2016 Jul;73(3):110-114. doi: 10.1080/09674845.2016.1188970.

We sought to identify new such targets in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The one-carbon folate pathway, specifically methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase-cyclohydrolase 2 (MTHFD2), emerged as a top candidate in our analyses. MTHFD2 is the most differentially expressed metabolic enzyme in cancer versus normal cells. Knockdown of MTHFD2 in AML cells decreased growth, induced differentiation, and impaired colony formation in primary AML blasts. In human xenograft and MLL-AF9 mouse leukemia models, MTHFD2 suppression decreased leukemia burden and prolonged survival. Based upon primary patient AML data and functional genomic screening, we determined that FLT3-ITD is a biomarker of response to MTHFD2 suppression. Mechanistically, MYC regulates the expression of MTHFD2, and MTHFD2 knockdown suppresses the TCA cycle. This study supports the therapeutic targeting of MTHFD2 in AML.","['Pikman, Yana', 'Puissant, Alexandre', 'Alexe, Gabriela', 'Furman, Andrew', 'Chen, Liying M', 'Frumm, Stacey M', 'Ross, Linda',

We assessed how these changes affected the life expectancy of patients with CML and life-years lost as a result of CML between 1973 and 2013 in Sweden. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients recorded as having CML in the Swedish Cancer Registry from 1973 to 2013 were included in the study and followed until death, censorship, or end of follow-up. The life expectancy and loss in expectation of life were predicted from a flexible parametric relative survival model. RESULTS: A total of 2,662 patients with CML were diagnosed between 1973 and 2013. Vast improvements in the life expectancy of these patients were seen over the study period; larger improvements were seen in the youngest ages. The great improvements in life expectancy translated into great reductions in the loss in expectation of life. Patients of all ages diagnosed in 2013 will, on average, lose < 3 life-years as a result of CML. CONCLUSION: Imatinib mesylate and new TKIs along with allogeneic stem cell transplantation and other factors have contributed to the life expectancy in patients with CML approaching that of the general population today. This will be an important message to convey to patients to understand the impact of a CML diagnosis on their life. In addition, the increasing prevalence of patients with CML will have a great effect on future health care costs as long as continuous TKI treatment is required.","['Bower, Hannah', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Dickman, Paul W', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Lambert, Paul C', 'Andersson, Therese M-L']","['Bower H', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Dickman PW', 'Hoglund M', 'Lambert PC', 'Andersson TM']","['Hannah Bower, Magnus Bjorkholm, Paul W.

On the other hand, DCTPP1 (dCTP pyrophosphatase 1) and dUTPase are two 'house-cleaning' nucleotidohydrolases involved in the elimination of non-canonical nucleotides. In the present study, we show that exposure of HeLa cells to decitabine up-regulates the expression of several pyrimidine metabolic enzymes including DCTPP1, dUTPase, dCMP deaminase and thymidylate synthase, thus suggesting their contribution to the cellular response to this anti-cancer nucleoside. We present several lines of evidence supporting that, in addition to the formation of aza-dCTP (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-5'-triphosphate), an alternative cytotoxic mechanism for decitabine may involve the formation of aza-dUMP, a potential thymidylate synthase inhibitor. Indeed, dUTPase or DCTPP1 down-regulation enhanced the cytotoxic effect of decitabine producing an accumulation of nucleoside triphosphates containing uracil as well as uracil misincorporation and double-strand breaks in genomic DNA. Moreover, DCTPP1 hydrolyses the triphosphate form of decitabine with similar kinetic efficiency to its natural substrate dCTP and prevents decitabine-induced global DNA demethylation. The data suggest that the nucleotidohydrolases DCTPP1 and dUTPase are factors involved in the mode of action of decitabine with potential value as enzymatic targets to improve decitabine-based chemotherapy.","['Requena, Cristina E', 'Perez-Moreno, Guiomar', 'Horvath, Andras', 'Vertessy, Beata G', 'Ruiz-Perez, Luis M', 'Gonzalez-Pacanowska, Dolores', 'Vidal, Antonio E']","['Requena CE', 'Perez-Moreno G', 'Horvath A', 'Vertessy BG', 'Ruiz-Perez LM', 'Gonzalez-Pacanowska D', 'Vidal AE']","['Departmento de Bioquimica y Farmacologia Molecular, Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez-Neyra, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Armilla (Granada), 18016, Spain.', 'Departmento de Bioquimica y Farmacologia Molecular, Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez-Neyra, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Armilla (Granada), 18016, Spain.', 'Institute of Enzymology, Research Center for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Science, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Institute of Enzymology, Research Center for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Science, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary Department of Applied Biotechnology and Food Sciences, University of Technology and Economics, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Departmento de Bioquimica y Farmacologia Molecular, Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez-Neyra, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Armilla (Granada), 18016, Spain.', 'Departmento de Bioquimica y Farmacologia Molecular, Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez-Neyra, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Armilla (Granada), 18016, Spain dgonzalez@ipb.csic.es avidal@ipb.csic.es.', 'Departmento de Bioquimica y Farmacologia Molecular, Instituto de Parasitologia y Biomedicina Lopez-Neyra, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC), Armilla (Granada), 18016, Spain dgonzalez@ipb.csic.es avidal@ipb.csic.es.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160620,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.12 (dCTP pyrophosphatase)', 'EC 3.6.1.23 (dUTP pyrophosphatase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Decitabine', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Pyrophosphatases/*metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DCTPP1', '*XTP3-TPA', '*dUTPase', '*decitabine', '*nucleotide pool']",2016/06/22 06:00,2017/06/21 06:00,['2016/06/22 06:00'],"['2016/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/21 06:00 [medline]']","['BCJ20160302 [pii]', '10.1042/BCJ20160302 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2016 Sep 1;473(17):2635-43. doi: 10.1042/BCJ20160302.

Here, we show that catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) targeted to genomic regions upstream or downstream of the transcription start site allows for specific and sustainable gene-expression level alterations in tumor cells in vitro and in syngeneic immune-competent mouse models. We used this approach for a high-coverage pooled gene-activation screen in vivo and discovered previously unidentified modulators of tumor growth and therapeutic response. Moreover, by using dCas9 linked to an activation domain, we can either enhance or suppress target gene expression simply by changing the genetic location of dCas9 binding relative to the transcription start site. We demonstrate that these directed changes in gene-transcription levels occur with minimal off-target effects. Our findings highlight the use of dCas9-mediated transcriptional regulation as a versatile tool to reproducibly interrogate tumor phenotypes in vivo.","['Braun, Christian J', 'Bruno, Peter M', 'Horlbeck, Max A', 'Gilbert, Luke A', 'Weissman, Jonathan S', 'Hemann, Michael T']","['Braun CJ', 'Bruno PM', 'Horlbeck MA', 'Gilbert LA', 'Weissman JS', 'Hemann MT']","['The David H.

Using biotinylation-based ChIP-seq and microarray analysis of both natural killer T (NKT) cells and PLZF-transgenic thymocytes, we identified several layers of regulation of the innate-like NKT effector program. First, PLZF bound and regulated genes encoding cytokine receptors as well as homing and adhesion receptors; second, PLZF bound and activated T-helper-specific transcription factor genes that in turn control T-helper-specific programs; finally, PLZF bound and suppressed the transcription of Bach2, a potent general repressor of effector differentiation in naive T cells. These findings reveal the multilayered architecture of the transcriptional program recruited by PLZF and elucidate how a single transcription factor can drive the developmental acquisition of a broad effector program.","['Mao, Ai-Ping', 'Constantinides, Michael G', 'Mathew, Rebecca', 'Zuo, Zhixiang', 'Chen, Xiaoting', 'Weirauch, Matthew T', 'Bendelac, Albert']","['Mao AP', 'Constantinides MG', 'Mathew R', 'Zuo Z', 'Chen X', 'Weirauch MT', 'Bendelac A']","['Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637; Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637;', 'Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637; Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637;', 'Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637; Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637;', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou 510060, China;', ""Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229; Division of Developmental Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45229."", ""Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229; Division of Developmental Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45229."", 'Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637; Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637; abendela@bsd.uchicago.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160620,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Bach2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/metabolism', 'Receptors, Chemokine/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*NKT', '*PLZF', '*development', '*lymphocyte']",2016/06/22 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/06/22 06:00'],"['2016/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1601504113 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1601504113 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Jul 5;113(27):7602-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1601504113.

However, population-based studies are scarce and there is no comprehensive enumeration of the risks across the whole range of site-specific cancers. Our aim was to provide this. DESIGN: We used an English national dataset of linked statistical records of hospital admissions and deaths from 1999 to 2011 to undertake a retrospective cohort study. SETTING: England. PARTICIPANTS: Records of all hospital admissions in England with SCD or with conditions included in the control cohort. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate ratios were calculated comparing rates of cancer in a sickle cell disease cohort and a control cohort, confining the analyses to people whose ethnicity was recorded as Black. RESULTS: Comparing the sickle cell disease cohort with the cohort without sickle cell disease, the rate ratio for all cancers combined was 2.1 (95% confidence interval 1.7-2.5). There were significantly high rate ratios for haematological malignancies, including Hodgkin's lymphoma (rate ratio 3.7, 1.5-8.4), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (2.6, 1.3-4.8), multiple myeloma (5.5, 2.8-10.1), lymphoid leukaemia (3.3, 1.3-8.0) and myeloid leukaemia (10.0, 4.6-21.5). Four solid tumours showed elevated rate ratios: colon cancer (2.8, 1.2-5.5), non-melanoma skin cancer (4.4, 1.3-12.2), kidney cancer (5.4, 2.3-11.5) and thyroid cancer (5.1, 1.3-15.4). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of some malignancies may be raised in patients with sickle cell disease. However, this study was based on administrative data without the scope to validate these against patients' full clinical records. Our findings need confirmation or refutation. If confirmed, work to elucidate, at the genetic and molecular level, why people with sickle cell disease have elevated risks of individual cancers might make contributions to the fundamental understanding of carcinogenesis.","['Seminog, Olena O', 'Ogunlaja, Oyindamola I', 'Yeates, David', 'Goldacre, Michael J']","['Seminog OO', 'Ogunlaja OI', 'Yeates D', 'Goldacre MJ']","['Unit of Health-Care Epidemiology, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.', 'Unit of Health-Care Epidemiology, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.', 'Unit of Health-Care Epidemiology, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK.', 'Unit of Health-Care Epidemiology, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK michael.goldacre@dph.ox.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160620,England,J R Soc Med,Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,7802879,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/*complications', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Databases, Factual', 'England', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Sickle cell disease', 'cancer risk', 'epidemiology', 'haematological malignancies', 'record linkage studies']",2016/06/22 06:00,2017/03/28 06:00,['2016/06/22 06:00'],"['2016/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['0141076816651037 [pii]', '10.1177/0141076816651037 [doi]']",ppublish,J R Soc Med. 2016 Aug;109(8):303-9. doi: 10.1177/0141076816651037.

METHODS: A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of GClb versus other chemoimmunotherapy options. The model comprised three mutually exclusive health states: ""progression-free survival (with/without therapy)"", ""progression (refractory/relapsed lines)"", and ""death"". Each state was assigned a health utility value representing patients' quality of life and a specific cost value. Comparisons between GClb and rituximab plus chlorambucil or only chlorambucil were performed using patient-level clinical trial data; other comparisons were performed via a network meta-analysis using information gathered in a systematic literature review. To support the model, a utility elicitation study was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. RESULTS: There was good agreement between the model-predicted progression-free and overall survival and that from the CLL11 trial. On incorporating data from the indirect treatment comparisons, it was found that GClb was cost-effective with a range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below a threshold of pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and remained so during deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses under various scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: GClb was estimated to increase both quality-adjusted life expectancy and treatment costs compared with several commonly used therapies, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below commonly referenced UK thresholds.

Montelukast (trade name Singulair) is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist used for asthma treatment. Mirroring Th1-Th2 polarization, two distinct states of macrophages have been recognized: the classically activated (M1) macrophages and the alternatively activated (M2) macrophages. M2 polarization is known to be a response to the Th2 cytokines; however, the effects of montelukast on M2 macrophages have not been well characterized. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of montelukast on the expression of cytokines and chemokines in M2-like macrophages, and to explore possible intracellular signaling pathways. METHODS: The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and human monocytes from healthy donors were cultured with interleukin-4 for M2 polarization, and then the cells were pretreated with or without montelukast before lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Supernatants were collected to determine interleukin-10, I-309/CCL1, and MDC/CCL22 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intracellular signaling was investigated using nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB inhibitors, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, and western blot analysis. RESULTS: LPS-induced interleukin-10 and I-309/CCL1 expression was significantly suppressed by montelukast in THP-1-derived and human monocyte-derived M2 macrophages after LPS stimulation. MDC/CCL22 expression was only significantly suppressed by montelukast in THP-1-derived M2 macrophages after 48 hours of incubation. In western blot analysis, montelukast was able to suppress LPS-induced MAPK-phospho-p38 and NF-kappaB-phospho-p65 expression. CONCLUSION: Montelukast suppressed LPS-induced M2-related cytokines and chemokines in alternatively activated macrophages, and the effects might be mediated through the MAPK-p38 and NF-kappaB-p65 pathways.","['Lin, Yi-Ching', 'Huang, Ming-Yii', 'Lee, Min-Sheng', 'Hsieh, Chong-Chao', 'Kuo, Hsuan-Fu', 'Kuo, Chang-Hung', 'Hung, Chih-Hsing']","['Lin YC', 'Huang MY', 'Lee MS', 'Hsieh CC', 'Kuo HF', 'Kuo CH', 'Hung CH']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Municipal Ta-Tung Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Cardiac Surgery, Department of Surgery, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kaohsiung Municipal Ta-Tung Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Ta-Kuo Clinic, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

Brazil, due to its large size and wide range of environmental challenges, presents numerous hazards to children's health. The aim of this study was to systematically review the scientific literature that describes children's exposures to environmental pollutants in Brazil and their effects on Brazilian children's health. A systematic review of the scientific literature was performed without language restrictions and time of publication (years). The literature search was conducted in the following key resources: PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus and Web of Science with the MeSH Terms: Environmental exposure AND Brazil (filters: Human, Child [birth to 18 years] and Affiliation Author). The Virtual Health Library was also employed to access the databases Scielo and Lilacs. The search strategy was [DeCS Terms]: Child OR adolescent AND Environmental exposure AND Brazil. Health effects in children associated with exposure to environmental pollutants in Brazil were reported in 74 studies, during the period between 1995 and 2015. The most frequently cited effect was hospital admission for respiratory causes including wheezing, asthma, and pneumonia among children living in areas with high concentrations of air pollutants. A broad spectrum of other health effects possibly linked to pollutants also was found such as prematurity, low birth weight, congenital abnormality (cryptorchidism, hypospadia, micropenis), poor performance in tests of psychomotor and mental development, and behavioral problems. Exposure to pesticides in utero and postnatally was associated with a high risk for leukemia in children <2 years old. These results show that there is a need in Brazil for stricter monitoring of pollutant emissions and for health surveillance programs especially among vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and young children.","['Froes Asmus, Carmen I R', 'Camara, Volney M', 'Landrigan, Philip J', 'Claudio, Luz']","['Froes Asmus CI', 'Camara VM', 'Landrigan PJ', 'Claudio L']","['Public Health Institute, School of Medicine, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Preventive Medicine Department, Icahn School of Medicine of Mount Sinai, New York, NY.

In order to find structure-activity relationships for developing anti-allergic agents with simple structures and potent activity, we synthesized several vanillic acid (VA) ester derivatives with C1-C4 and C8 alkyl chains and evaluated their degranulation inhibitory activities. The most active compound of VA ester derivatives was derivative 5 with a C4 straight alkyl chain, and derivative 5 exhibited approximately three-fold greater inhibitory activity than that of 1. Moreover, we designed 8 types of analogs based on 5, and we found that the minimum structure for potent degranulation inhibitory activity requires direct connection of the butyl ester moiety on the benzene ring and at least one hydroxyl group on the benzene ring.

Oral selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compounds that block XPO1 function were recently identified and hold promise as a new therapeutic paradigm in many neoplasms. One of these compounds, KPT-330 (selinexor), has made progress in Phase I/II clinical trials, but systemic toxicities limit its administration to twice-per-week and requiring supportive care. We designed a new generation SINE compound, KPT-8602, with a similar mechanism of XPO1 inhibition and potency but considerably improved tolerability. Efficacy of KPT-8602 was evaluated in preclinical animal models of hematological malignancies, including CLL and AML. KPT-8602 shows similar in vitro potency compared with KPT-330 but lower central nervous system penetration, which resulted in enhanced tolerability, even when dosed daily, and improved survival in CLL and AML murine models compared with KPT-330. KPT-8602 is a promising compound for further development in hematological malignancies and other cancers in which upregulation of XPO1 is seen. The wider therapeutic window of KPT-8602 may also allow increased on-target efficacy leading to even more efficacious combinations with other targeted anticancer therapies.","['Hing, Z A', 'Fung, H Y J', 'Ranganathan, P', 'Mitchell, S', 'El-Gamal, D', 'Woyach, J A', 'Williams, K', 'Goettl, V M', 'Smith, J', 'Yu, X', 'Meng, X', 'Sun, Q', 'Cagatay, T', 'Lehman, A M', 'Lucas, D M', 'Baloglu, E', 'Shacham, S', 'Kauffman, M G', 'Byrd, J C', 'Chook, Y M', 'Garzon, R', 'Lapalombella, R']","['Hing ZA', 'Fung HY', 'Ranganathan P', 'Mitchell S', 'El-Gamal D', 'Woyach JA', 'Williams K', 'Goettl VM', 'Smith J', 'Yu X', 'Meng X', 'Sun Q', 'Cagatay T', 'Lehman AM', 'Lucas DM', 'Baloglu E', 'Shacham S', 'Kauffman MG', 'Byrd JC', 'Chook YM', 'Garzon R', 'Lapalombella R']","['Medical Scientist Training Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA, USA.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA, USA.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160520,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/06/22 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/06/22 06:00'],"['2015/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016136 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.136 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Dec;30(12):2364-2372. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.136.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the activity of the CDK/Cyclin D complex is increased. The mechanism involved is unknown, as are the respective roles played by CDK4 or CDK6 in this process. Here, we report that AML cells carrying FLT3-ITD mutations are dependent on CDK6 for cell proliferation while CDK4 is not essential. We showed that FLT3-ITD signaling is responsible for CDK6 overexpression, through a pathway involving the SRC-family kinase HCK. Accordingly, FLT3-ITD failed to transform primary hematopoietic progenitor cells from Cdk6-/- mice. Our results demonstrate that CDK6 is the primary target of CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors in FLT3-ITD positive AML.

In order to optimize cell manufacturing, we sought to develop a novel clinical-grade protocol to obtain CAR-modified cytokine-induced killer cells (CIKs) using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system. Administration of irradiated PBMCs overcame cell death of stimulating cells induced by non-viral transfection, enabling robust gene transfer together with efficient T-cell expansion. Upon single stimulation, we reached an average of 60% expression of CD123- and CD19- specific 3rd generation CARs (CD28/OX40/TCRzeta). Furthermore, modified cells displayed persistence of cell subsets with memory phenotype, specific and effective lytic activity against leukemic cell lines and primary blasts, cytokine secretion, and proliferation. Adoptive transfer of CD123.CAR or CD19.CAR lymphocytes led to a significant anti-tumor response against acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) disseminated diseases in NSG mice. Notably, we found no evidence of integration enrichment near cancer genes and transposase expression at the end of the differentiation.

PBSC were freshly isolated and infused without ex vivo T-cell depletion into the recipients. Myeloid recovery was achieved in 99.2% patients with full donor chimerism. The cumulative incidence of acute grade 3-4 GvHD, overall and extensive chronic GvHD was 14.9%, 38.6% and 16.5%, respectively. The 3-year non-relapse mortality rate was 24.1%. Non-remission prior to transplant was associated with higher incidence of relapse (P=0.006), inferior overall survival (P=0.017) and leukemia-free survival (P=0.024). These data suggest that PBSC is a reliable graft source in haploidentical, unmanipulated transplant settings under myeloablative conditioning in patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies.","['Huang, W-R', 'Li, H-H', 'Gao, C-J', 'Bo, J', 'Li, F', 'Dou, L-P', 'Wang, L-L', 'Jing, Y', 'Wang, L', 'Liu, D-H', 'Yu, L']","['Huang WR', 'Li HH', 'Gao CJ', 'Bo J', 'Li F', 'Dou LP', 'Wang LL', 'Jing Y', 'Wang L', 'Liu DH', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160620,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Chimerism', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/11/03 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2016/06/21 06:00'],"['2016/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/21 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2016166 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2016.166 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2016 Nov;51(11):1464-1469. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2016.166.

Nonetheless, even with transplant, the rates of post-HCT relapse are unacceptably high, and remain a great challenge in the treatment of patients with AML. Maintenance therapies after allo-HCT, given to patients at high risk of relapse or with evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD), may provide a way to reduce relapse rates and improve survival. New therapies may offer acceptable toxicity profiles in the post-HCT setting, and investigations are ongoing using hypomethylating agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors, drug-antibody conjugates and cellular therapies. Future directions in the field of post-HCT therapies may include better risk stratification with MRD, as well as the exploitation of novel mechanisms such as immune checkpoint inhibition and modified chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. In this mini review, we discuss the current landscape of clinical research in post-HCT maintenance therapies, as well as future therapeutic strategies of interest. Although there is great potential for post-HCT agents to improve AML outcomes, these will need to be evaluated prospectively through well-designed randomized clinical trials.","['Brunner, A M', 'Fathi, A T', 'Chen, Y B']","['Brunner AM', 'Fathi AT', 'Chen YB']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160620,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Forecasting', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy', 'Recurrence']",,,2016/11/03 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2016/06/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2016160 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2016.160 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2016 Nov;51(11):1423-1430. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2016.160.

The intracellular human enzyme Paraoxonase-2 (PON2) is known to have anti-apoptotic properties in leukemia and oral squamous cell cancer (OSCC) cells. However, the distinct regulating pathways are poorly understood. First, we present a so far unknown regulation of PON2 protein expression through the Wnt/GSK3beta/beta-catenin pathway in leukemia and OSCC cells. This was confirmed via in silico analysis, promoter reporter studies and treatment of multiple cell lines (K562, SCC-4, PCI-13) with different Wnt ligands/inhibitors in vitro. Ex vivo analysis of OSCC patients revealed a correlation between PON2 and beta-catenin expression in tumor tissue. Higher PON2 expression in OSCC is associated with relapse independently of treatment (e.g. surgery/radio-/chemotherapy). These results emphasize the clinical impact of the newly described regulation of PON2 through Wnt/GSK3beta/beta-catenin. More importantly, the study revealed the fundamental finding of an overall Wnt/GSK3beta/beta-catenin dependent regulation of PON2 in different cancers, which was confirmed by systematic and multimethodological approaches. Thus, the herein presented mechanistic insight contributes to a better understanding of tumor specific escape from cell death strategies and suggests PON2 as a new potential biomarker for therapy resistance or as a prognostic tumor marker.","['Kruger, Maximilian', 'Amort, Julianna', 'Wilgenbus, Petra', 'Helmstadter, Johanna P', 'Grechowa, Irina', 'Ebert, Julia', 'Tenzer, Stefan', 'Moergel, Maximilian', 'Witte, Ines', 'Horke, Sven']","['Kruger M', 'Amort J', 'Wilgenbus P', 'Helmstadter JP', 'Grechowa I', 'Ebert J', 'Tenzer S', 'Moergel M', 'Witte I', 'Horke S']","['Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery - Plastic Surgery, University Medical Center of The Johannes Gutenberg-University, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center of The JGU Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center of The JGU Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Center for Thrombosis and Hemostasis, University Medical Center of The JGU Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center of The JGU Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center of The JGU Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Division of Vascular Surgery, Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, University Medical Center of The Johannes Gutenberg-University, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center of The JGU Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Center for Thrombosis and Hemostasis, University Medical Center of The JGU Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute for Immunology, University Medical Center of The Johannes Gutenberg-University, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery - Plastic Surgery, University Medical Center of The Johannes Gutenberg-University, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center of The JGU Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University Medical Center of The JGU Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.', 'Center for Thrombosis and Hemostasis, University Medical Center of The JGU Mainz, 55131 Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 3.1.8.1 (Aryldialkylphosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.8.1 (PON2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/radiation effects', 'Aryldialkylphosphatase/*genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics/radiotherapy', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/radiation effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/radiation effects', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*genetics/radiotherapy', 'Radiation Tolerance/*genetics', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/physiology', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Wnt / beta-catenin', 'leukemia', 'oral squamous cancer cell', 'paraoxonase-2', 'tumor']",2016/06/21 06:00,2018/02/06 06:00,['2016/06/21 06:00'],"['2016/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['9013 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9013 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 9;7(32):51082-51095. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9013.,10.18632/oncotarget.9013 [doi],,PMC5239460,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined epigenetic heterogeneity as assessed by cytosine methylation within defined genomic loci with four CpGs (epialleles), somatic mutations, and transcriptomes of AML patient samples at serial time points. We observed that epigenetic allele burden is linked to inferior outcome and varies considerably during disease progression. Epigenetic and genetic allelic burden and patterning followed different patterns and kinetics during disease progression. We observed a subset of AMLs with high epiallele and low somatic mutation burden at diagnosis, a subset with high somatic mutation and lower epiallele burdens at diagnosis, and a subset with a mixed profile, suggesting distinct modes of tumor heterogeneity. Genes linked to promoter-associated epiallele shifts during tumor progression showed increased single-cell transcriptional variance and differential expression, suggesting functional impact on gene regulation. Thus, genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity can occur with distinct kinetics likely to affect the biological and clinical features of tumors.","['Li, Sheng', 'Garrett-Bakelman, Francine E', 'Chung,

The aim of the study was to identify the factors influencing the treatment abandonment rate (AR) of AML. Of the 474 AML cases examined, 264 were abandoned (55.7%). The most important factor affecting AR appeared to be the AML subtype-that is, the M3 versus non-M3 (42% vs. 60%). Patient age was observed to be closely related to AR-the older the patients, the lower the AR-and infants had the highest prevalence of abandonment (84.2%). The patient's residential location was markedly correlated to AR, which was almost inversely proportional to the size of the township where the patient came from.

Here, we performed sequence analysis of a regulatory upstream section of MEF2C in T-ALL cell lines which, however, proved devoid of mutations. Unexpectedly, we found strong conservation between the regulatory upstream region of MEF2C (located at chromosomal band 5q14) and an intergenic stretch at 7q11 located between STAG3L4 and AUTS2, covering nearly 20 kb. While the non-coding gene STAG3L4 was inconspicuously expressed, AUTS2 was aberrantly upregulated in 6% of T-ALL patients (public dataset GSE42038) and in 3/24 T-ALL cell lines, two of which represented very immature differentiation stages. AUTS2 expression was higher in normal B-cells than in T-cells, indicating lineage-specific activity in lymphopoiesis. While excluding chromosomal aberrations, examinations of AUTS2 transcriptional regulation in T-ALL cells revealed activation by IL7-IL7R-STAT5-signalling and MEF2C. AUTS2 protein has been shown to interact with polycomb repressor complex 1 subtype 5 (PRC1.5), transforming this particular complex into an activator. Accordingly, expression profiling and functional analyses demonstrated that AUTS2 activated while PCGF5 repressed transcription of NKL homeobox gene MSX1 in T-ALL cells. Forced expression and pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 in addition to H3K27me3 analysis indicated that PRC2 repressed MSX1 as well. Taken together, we found that AUTS2 and MEF2C, despite lying on different chromosomes, share strikingly similar regulatory upstream regions and aberrant expression in T-ALL subsets. Our data implicate chromatin complexes PRC1/AUTS2 and PRC2 in a gene network in T-ALL regulating early lymphoid differentiation.","['Nagel, Stefan', 'Pommerenke, Claudia', 'Meyer, Corinna', 'Kaufmann, Maren', 'Drexler, Hans G', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F']","['Nagel S', 'Pommerenke C', 'Meyer C', 'Kaufmann M', 'Drexler HG', 'MacLeod RA']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Department of Human and Animal Cell Lines, Leibniz-Institute DSMZ - German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (AUTS2 protein, human)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (MEF2 Transcription Factors)', '0 (MEF2C protein, human)', '0 (MSX1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (MSX1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'MEF2 Transcription Factors/physiology', 'MSX1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*physiology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*physiology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'Transcription Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['IL-7', 'IL7R', 'MEF2C', 'PRC1', 'PRC2']",2016/06/21 06:00,2018/02/07 06:00,['2016/06/21 06:00'],"['2016/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['9982 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9982 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 19;7(29):45398-45413. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9982.,10.18632/oncotarget.9982 [doi],,PMC5216730,['The authors declare they have no known conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We searched the PubMed database for clinical studies from the past decade, including data evaluating the impact of mutp53 in clinical chemotherapy response. RESULTS: Interactions between mutp53 and transcriptional factors, proteins or DNA structures, as well as epigenetic regulation, contribute to mutp53 GOF. Major mechanisms of mutp53-induced chemoresistance include enhanced drug efflux and metabolism, promoting survival, inhibiting apoptosis, upregulating DNA repair, suppressing autophagy, elevating microenvironmental resistance and inducing a stem-like phenotype. Clinically, mutp53 predicted resistance to chemotherapy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and esophageal and oropharyngeal cancers, but its impact on chronic lymphocytic leukemia was unclear. In bladder cancer, mutp53 did not predict resistance, whereas in some breast and ovarian cancers, it was associated with sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic agents. CONCLUSION: mutp53 has an intricate role in the response to clinical chemotherapy and should not be interpreted in isolation. Furthermore, when predicting tumor response to chemotherapy based on the p53 status, the drugs used should also be taken into consideration. These concepts require further investigation.","['He, Chao', 'Li, Lun', 'Guan, Xuan', 'Xiong, Li', 'Miao, Xiongying']","['He C', 'Li L', 'Guan X', 'Xiong L', 'Miao X']","['Department of General Surgery, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160621,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/06/21 06:00,2017/02/09 06:00,['2016/06/21 06:00'],"['2015/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['000446361 [pii]', '10.1159/000446361 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2017;62(1):43-53. doi: 10.1159/000446361.

Compared to ALL in children, adult ALL has a much lower cure rate. Therefore, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying high-risk ALL and to develop therapeutic strategies that specifically target genes or pathways in ALL. Here, we explored the IL7R and SH2B3 expression in adult ALL and found that IL7R is significantly higher and Sh2B3 lower expressed in B-ALL compared to normal bone marrow control, and the IL7RhighSH2B3low is associated with high-risk factors, and with high relapse rate and low disease-free survival rate in the patients. We also found that Ikaros deletion was associated with the IL7RhighSH2B3low expression pattern and Ikaros directly binds the IL7R and SH2B3 promoter, and suppresses IL7R and promotes SH2B3 expression. On the other hand, casein kinase inhibitor, which increases Ikaros function, inhibits IL7R and stimulates SH2B3 expression in an Ikaros dependent manner. Our data indicate that IL7RhighSH2B3low expression distinguishes a novel subset of high-risk B-ALL associated with Ikaros dysfunction, and also suggest the therapeutic potential for treatment that combines casein kinase inhibitor, as an Ikaros activator, with drugs that target the IL7R signaling pathway.","['Ge, Zheng', 'Gu, Yan', 'Xiao, Lichan', 'Han, Qi', 'Li, Jianyong', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Yu, James', 'Kawasawa, Yuka Imamura', 'Payne, Kimberly J', 'Dovat, Sinisa', 'Song, Chunhua']","['Ge Z', 'Gu Y', 'Xiao L', 'Han Q', 'Li J', 'Chen B', 'Yu J', 'Kawasawa YI', 'Payne KJ', 'Dovat S', 'Song C']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University Medical School, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University Medical College, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University Medical School, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry & Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.', 'Penn State Hershey Genome Sciences Facility, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Human Anatomy, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA 92350, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University Medical College, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University Medical College, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (IL7R protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SH2B3 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit/*biosynthesis', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Proteins/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['IL7R', 'Ikaros', 'SH2B3', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'gene expression']",2016/06/21 06:00,2018/01/09 06:00,['2016/06/21 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10014 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10014 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 19;7(29):46014-46027. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10014.,10.18632/oncotarget.10014 [doi],,PMC5216778,['All the authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a retrovirus, its life cycle includes a step where HTLV-1 is integrated into the host genomic DNA and forms proviral DNA. In the chronic phase of the infection, HTLV1 is known to proliferate as a provirus via the mitotic division of the infected host cells. There are generally tens of thousands of infected clones within an infected individual. They exist not only in peripheral blood, but also in various lymphoid organs. Viral proteins encoded in HTLV-1 genome play a role in the proliferation and survival of the infected cells. As is the case with other chronic viral infections, HTLV-1 gene expression induces the activation of the host immunity against the virus. Thus, the transcription from HTLV-1 provirus needs to be controlled in order to evade the host immune surveillance. There should be a dynamic and complex regulation in vivo, where an equilibrium between viral antigen expression and host immune surveillance is achieved. The mechanisms regulating viral gene expression from the provirus are a key to understanding the persistent/latent infection with HTLV-1 and its pathogenesis. In this article, we would like to review our current understanding on this topic.","['Miyazato, Paola', 'Matsuo, Misaki', 'Katsuya, Hiroo', 'Satou, Yorifumi']","['Miyazato P', 'Matsuo M', 'Katsuya H', 'Satou Y']","['International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Center for AIDS Research, Priority Organization for Innovation and Excellence, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan. pmiyazat@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Center for AIDS Research, Priority Organization for Innovation and Excellence, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan. 163r5152@st.kumamoto-u.ac.jp.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Center for AIDS Research, Priority Organization for Innovation and Excellence, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan. hkatsuya@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Center for AIDS Research, Priority Organization for Innovation and Excellence, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan. y-satou@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160616,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,,IM,"['*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Proviruses/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Latency']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HTLV-1 2', '*provirus 3', '*retroviral latency']",2016/06/21 06:00,2017/09/14 06:00,['2016/06/21 06:00'],"['2016/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['v8060171 [pii]', '10.3390/v8060171 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2016 Jun 16;8(6). pii: v8060171. doi: 10.3390/v8060171.,10.3390/v8060171 [doi] E171 [pii],,PMC4926191,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While HTLV-1 infection is generally asymptomatic, 3%-5% of infected individuals develop a highly malignant and intractable T-cell neoplasm known as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) decades after infection. How HTLV-1 infection progresses to ATL is not well understood. Two viral regulatory proteins, Tax and HTLV-1 basic zipper protein (HBZ), encoded by the sense and antisense viral transcripts, respectively, are thought to play indispensable roles in the oncogenic process of ATL. This review focuses on the roles of Tax and HBZ in viral replication, persistence, and oncogenesis. Special emphasis is directed towards recent literature on the mechanisms of action of these two proteins and the roles of Tax and HBZ in influencing the outcomes of HTLV-1 infection including senescence induction, viral latency and persistence, genome instability, cell proliferation, and ATL development. Attempts are made to integrate results from cell-based studies of HTLV-1 infection and studies of HTLV-1 proviral integration site preference, clonality, and clonal expansion based on high throughput DNA sequencing. Recent data showing that Tax hijacks key mediators of DNA double-strand break repair signaling-the ubiquitin E3 ligase, ring finger protein 8 (RNF8) and the ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzyme (UBC13)-to activate the canonical nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-kappaB) and other signaling pathways will be discussed. A perspective on how the Tax-RNF8 signaling axis might impact genomic instability and how Tax may collaborate with HBZ to drive oncogenesis is provided.","['Giam, Chou-Zen', 'Semmes, Oliver John']","['Giam CZ', 'Semmes OJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, 4301 Jones Bridge Rd., Bethesda, MD 20814, USA. chou-zen.giam@usuhs.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology, The Leroy T.

It is characterised by rapid growth of malignant leukocytes that accumulate in the bone marrow and suppress normal haematopoiesis. This systemic disease remains a serious medical burden worldwide. Characterisation of protein antigens specifically expressed by malignant cells, but not by healthy leukocytes, is vital for the diagnostics and targeted treatment of AML. Here we report, for the first time, that the neuronal receptor latrophilin-1 is expressed in human monocytic leukaemia cell lines and in primary human AML cells.

Latrophilin-1 is functional in leukaemia cells tested, and its biosynthesis is controlled through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a master regulator of myeloid cell translational pathways. Our findings demonstrate that latrophilin-1 could be considered as a novel biomarker of human AML, which offers potential new avenues for AML diagnosis and treatment.","['Sumbayev, Vadim V', 'Goncalves Silva, Isabel', 'Blackburn, Jennifer', 'Gibbs, Bernhard F', 'Yasinska, Inna M', 'Garrett, Michelle D', 'Tonevitsky, Alexander G', 'Ushkaryov, Yuri A']","['Sumbayev VV', 'Goncalves Silva I', 'Blackburn J', 'Gibbs BF', 'Yasinska IM', 'Garrett MD', 'Tonevitsky AG', 'Ushkaryov YA']","['School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham, Kent, ME4 4TB, United Kingdom.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham, Kent, ME4 4TB, United Kingdom.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham, Kent, ME4 4TB, United Kingdom.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham, Kent, ME4 4TB, United Kingdom.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham, Kent, ME4 4TB, United Kingdom.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, CT2 7NJ, United Kingdom.', 'Hertsen Moscow Oncology Research Institute, Branch of The National Medical Research Radiological Center, Ministry of Health of The Russian Federation, 125284, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Kent, Chatham, Kent, ME4 4TB, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (ADGRL1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Peptide/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['latrophilin', 'mammalian target of rapamycin', 'myeloid leukaemia']",2016/06/21 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2016/06/21 06:00'],"['2016/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10039 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10039 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 19;7(29):45575-45583. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10039.,10.18632/oncotarget.10039 [doi],,PMC5216743,['CONFLICTS OF INTREST None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With a structure-based drug design approach we have discovered a novel inhibitor CHMFL-074, that potently inhibits both the native and a variety of clinically emerged mutants of BCR-ABL kinase. The X-ray crystal structure of CHMFL-074 in complex with ABL1 kinase (PDB ID: 5HU9) revealed a typical type II binding mode (DFG-out) but relatively rare hinge binding. Kinome wide selectivity profiling demonstrated that CHMFL-074 bore a high selectivity (S score(1) = 0.03) and potently inhibited ABL1 kinase (IC50: 24 nM) and PDGFR alpha/beta (IC50: 71 nM and 88 nM). CHMFL-074 displayed strong anti-proliferative efficacy against BCR-ABL-driven CML cell lines such as K562 (GI50: 56 nM), MEG-01 (GI50: 18 nM) and KU812 (GI50: 57 nM). CHMFL-074 arrested cell cycle into the G0/G1 phase and induced apoptosis in the Ph+ CML cell lines. In addition, it potently inhibited the CML patient primary cell's proliferation but did not affect the normal bone marrow cells. In the CML cell K562 inoculated xenograft mouse model, oral administration of 100 mg/kg/d of CHMFL-074 achieved a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 65% without exhibiting apparent toxicity. As a potential drug candidate for fighting CML, CHMFL-074 is under extensive preclinical safety evaluation now.","['Liu, Feiyang', 'Wang, Beilei', 'Wang, Qiang', 'Qi, Ziping', 'Chen, Cheng', 'Kong, Lu-Lu', 'Chen, Ji-Yun', 'Liu, Xiaochuan', 'Wang, Aoli', 'Hu, Chen', 'Wang, Wenchao', 'Wang, Huiping', 'Wu, Fan', 'Ruan, Yanjie', 'Qi, Shuang', 'Liu, Juan', 'Zou, Fengming', 'Hu, Zhenquan', 'Wang, Wei', 'Wang, Li', 'Zhang, Shanchun', 'Yun, Cai-Hong', 'Zhai, Zhimin', 'Liu, Jing', 'Liu, Qingsong']","['Liu F', 'Wang B', 'Wang Q', 'Qi Z', 'Chen C', 'Kong LL', 'Chen JY', 'Liu X', 'Wang A', 'Hu C', 'Wang W', 'Wang H', 'Wu F', 'Ruan Y', 'Qi S', 'Liu J', 'Zou F', 'Hu Z', 'Wang W', 'Wang L', 'Zhang S', 'Yun CH', 'Zhai Z', 'Liu J', 'Liu Q']","['High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei 230031, Anhui, P.

Most patients with AML become resistant to treatment due to lack of effective cytotoxic and differentiation promoting compounds. High MN1 expression confers poor prognosis to AML patients and induces resistance to cytarabine and alltrans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induced differentiation. Using a high-throughput drug screening, we identified the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) antagonist pyrimethamine to be a potent inducer of apoptosis and differentiation in several murine and human leukemia cell lines. Oral pyrimethamine treatment was effective in two xenograft mouse models and specifically targeted leukemic cells in human AML cell lines and primary patient cells, while CD34+ cells from healthy donors were unaffected. The antileukemic effects of PMT could be partially rescued by excess folic acid, suggesting an oncogenic function of folate metabolism in AML.

METHODS: A total of 1114 consecutive specimens from patients with acute leukemia were tested using a commercial multiplex RT-PCR kit (HemaVision, DNA Diagnostic). NPM1 and CEBPA mutations were selectively tested in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with multiplex RT-PCR negativity. RESULTS: In specimens with optimal cytogenetics, the frequency of recurrent translocations was 31.3%, and cryptic translocations were detected in 2.1% of samples. The concordance rate between karyotyping and multiplex RT-PCR was 97.5%. In addition to the established functions, we demonstrated the additional benefits of multiplex RT-PCR, including successful molecular characterization, even in cytogenetically suboptimal specimens (5.7%); detection of submicroscopic aberrations (1.0%); detection of rare but potentially significant translocations or variants (2.5%); selection of AML candidates for mutation analysis (68.3%); and finally exclusion of recurrent translocations in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or mixed phenotype acute leukemia (22.5%). CONCLUSION: We reconfirmed the accuracy and reliability of multiplex RT-PCR for diagnosing acute leukemia and demonstrated additional advantages of this system for the initial evaluation of acute leukemia. Thus, multiplex RT-PCR is worth considering in diagnostic testing of acute leukemias.","['Kim, B', 'Cho, Y-U', 'Bae, M-H', 'Jang, S', 'Seo, E-J', 'Chi, H-S', 'Park, C-J']","['Kim B', 'Cho YU', 'Bae MH', 'Jang S', 'Seo EJ', 'Chi HS', 'Park CJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan, College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan, College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan, College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan, College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan, College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan, College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan, College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160620,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['Multiplex RT-PCR', 'mutation screening', 'rare aberrations', 'submicroscopic translocations', 'suboptimal cytogenetics']",2016/06/21 06:00,2017/03/03 06:00,['2016/06/21 06:00'],"['2015/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12521 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2016 Aug;38(4):444-53. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12521.

We report a molecular imaging approach to quantitate protein levels by digitized, discrete counting of nanoparticle-tagged proteins. Digitized protein counting provides ultrasensitive molecular detection of proteins in single cells that surpasses conventional methods of quantitating total diffuse fluorescence, and offers a substantial improvement in protein quantitation. We implement this digitized proteomic approach in an integrated imaging platform, the single cell-quantum dot platform (SC-QDP), to execute sensitive single cell phosphoquantitation in response to multiple drug treatment conditions and using limited primary patient material. The SC-QDP: 1) identified pAKT and pERK phospho-heterogeneity and insensitivity in individual leukemia cells treated with a multi-drug panel of FDA-approved kinase inhibitors, and 2) revealed subpopulations of drug-insensitive CD34+ stem cells with high pCRKL and pSTAT5 signaling in chronic myeloid leukemia patient blood samples. This ultrasensitive digitized protein detection approach is valuable for uncovering subtle but important differences in signaling, drug insensitivity, and other key cellular processes amongst single cells.","['Jacob, Thomas', 'Agarwal, Anupriya', 'Ramunno-Johnson, Damien', ""O'Hare, Thomas"", 'Gonen, Mehmet', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Vu, Tania Q']","['Jacob T', 'Agarwal A', 'Ramunno-Johnson D', ""O'Hare T"", 'Gonen M', 'Tyner JW', 'Druker BJ', 'Vu TQ']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Oregon Health &Science University, Portland OR 97201, USA.', 'OHSU Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine, Oregon Health &Science University, Portland OR 97201, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, The Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health &Science University, Portland OR 97239, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Oregon Health &Science University, Portland OR 97201, USA.', 'OHSU Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine, Oregon Health &Science University, Portland OR 97201, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, 2000 Circle of Hope, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Oregon Health &Science University, Portland OR 97201, USA.', 'Department of Industrial Engineering, Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, The Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health &Science University, Portland OR 97239, USA.', 'Department of Cell Developmental &Cancer Biology, Oregon Health &Science University, Portland OR 97239, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, The Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health &Science University, Portland OR 97239, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Portland, Oregon, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Oregon Health &Science University, Portland OR 97201, USA.', 'OHSU Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine, Oregon Health &Science University, Portland OR 97201, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, The Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health &Science University, Portland OR 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160620,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Quantum Dots', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",,,2016/06/21 06:00,2018/05/25 06:00,['2016/06/21 06:00'],"['2016/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['srep28163 [pii]', '10.1038/srep28163 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Jun 20;6:28163. doi: 10.1038/srep28163.,10.1038/srep28163 [doi],"['R37 CA065823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS071116/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA183974/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA151457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA042014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",PMC4913309,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the original reports by Wiedemann and co-workers, and Steiner and Marques, only a few cases have been described. Recently, the clinical variability of the disorder has more precisely been characterized by Jones and co-workers, who also identified heterozygous KMT2A mutations as the molecular defect underlying this condition. Here, we report on a boy with a complex phenotype overlapping WSS but exhibiting epilepsy, feeding difficulties, microcephaly, and congenital immunodeficiency with low levels of immunoglobulins as additional features. Whole exome sequencing allowed identifying a previously unreported de novo KMT2A missense mutation affecting the DNA binding domain of the methyltransferase.

It remains unclear whether transient treatment discontinuation or dose changes affect outcome and this approach has not yet been approved for use outside clinical trials. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-institution observational study to evaluate factors affecting response in 'real-life' clinical practice in 138 chronic myeloid leukemia patients in chronic phase treated with imatinib. We used a novel longitudinal data analytical model, with a generalized estimating equation model, to study BCR-ABL variation according to continuous standard dose, change in dose or discontinuation; BCR-ABL transcript levels were recorded. Treatment history was subdivided into time periods for which treatment was given at constant dosage (total 483 time periods). Molecular and cytogenetic complete response was observed after 154 (32%) and 358 (74%) time periods, respectively. RESULTS: After adjusting for length of time period, no association between dose and cytogenetic complete response rate was observed. There was a significantly lower molecular complete response rate after time periods at a high imatinib dosage. DISCUSSION: This statistical approach can identify individual patient variation in longitudinal data collected over time and suggests that changes in dose or discontinuation of therapy could be considered in patients with appropriate biological characteristics.","['Merante, Serena', 'Ferretti, Virginia', 'Elena, Chiara', 'Calvello, Celeste', 'Rocca, Barbara', 'Zappatore, Rita', 'Cavigliano, Paola', 'Orlandi, Ester']","['Merante S', 'Ferretti V', 'Elena C', 'Calvello C', 'Rocca B', 'Zappatore R', 'Cavigliano P', 'Orlandi E']","['a Department of Onco-Hematology , Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo , Pavia , Italy.', 'a Department of Onco-Hematology , Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo , Pavia , Italy.', 'a Department of Onco-Hematology , Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo , Pavia , Italy.', 'b Department of Molecular Medicine , University of Pavia , Pavia , Italy.', 'a Department of Onco-Hematology , Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo , Pavia , Italy.', 'a Department of Onco-Hematology , Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo , Pavia , Italy.', 'a Department of Onco-Hematology , Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo , Pavia , Italy.', 'a Department of Onco-Hematology , Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo , Pavia , Italy.', 'a Department of Onco-Hematology , Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo , Pavia , Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160619,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Imatinib', 'Novel statistical analysis', ""'Real-life'""]",2016/06/21 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/06/21 06:00'],"['2016/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2016.1196866 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2017 Jan;22(1):1-8. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2016.1196866.

(ii) If yes, which are the antigen-presenting cells responsible? (iii) Can this information assist the development of complementary therapies to improve ACT? Our results indicate that the target (tumor) cells, not cross-presenting cells, are the main culprits of antigen-specific CTL inactivation. We find that the affinity/avidity of the CTL-tumor cell interaction has little influence on ACT outcomes, while tumor density is a major determinant. Reduction of tumor burden with mild non-lymphoablative and non-inflammatory chemotherapy can dramatically improve the efficacy of ACT and may minimize side-effects. We propose a general mechanism for the inactivation of anti-self CTL in the same tissues where the activity of anti-foreign CTL is preserved, based on the density of target cells. This mechanism, which we tentatively call stunning, may have evolved to protect infected sites from self-destruction and is exploited by tumors to inactivate CTL.","['Villadangos, Jose A']",['Villadangos JA'],"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Doherty Institute of Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', '*Autoimmunity', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Cell Survival', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/transplantation', 'Tumor Burden']",['NOTNLM'],"['*antigen presentation', '*cancer', '*cytotoxic T cells', '*dendritic cells', '*immunotherapy', '*myeloid-derived suppressor cells']",2016/06/21 06:00,2017/07/19 06:00,['2016/06/21 06:00'],"['2016/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imr.12433 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2016 Jul;272(1):169-82. doi: 10.1111/imr.12433.,10.1111/imr.12433 [doi],,,,,,['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We present the demographic characteristics and nutrient intake at study entry of a prospective cohort in which evaluating dietary intake in children diagnosed with ALL was investigated. METHODS: Dietary intake data were collected for participants enrolled on the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol. Dietary intake was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire and was compared with the dietary reference intake by ALL risk group (standard and high risk). RESULTS: Dietary intake data were collected from 81% of participants (n = 640). We found that 27% of participants were overweight/obese. Intake of total calories and other nutrients exceeded the dietary reference intake in up to 79% of children. This was evident in both risk groups and was pronounced among younger children. For micronutrients, dietary intake of calcium, vitamin D (females only), and zinc differed significantly between patients with standard-risk and those with high-risk ALL. CONCLUSIONS: This study was successful in collecting dietary intake data at the time of cancer diagnosis in a multicenter setting in a pediatric population at high-risk for nutrition-related morbidity. We identified ""at-risk"" dietary intakes, which vary by sex and ALL risk group; such patients may benefit from future dietary interventions.","['Ladas, Elena J', 'Orjuela, Manuela', 'Stevenson, Kristen', 'Cole, Peter D', 'Lin, Meiko', 'Athale, Uma H', 'Clavell, Luis A', 'Leclerc, Jean-Marie', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Schorin, Marshall A', 'Welch, Jennifer Greene', 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Kelly, Kara M']","['Ladas EJ', 'Orjuela M', 'Stevenson K', 'Cole PD', 'Lin M', 'Athale UH', 'Clavell LA', 'Leclerc JM', 'Michon B', 'Schorin MA', 'Welch JG', 'Asselin BL', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB', 'Kelly KM']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplant, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA; Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.

The composition of each layer of sensor probe was confirmed by electrochemical and surface characterization experiments. Both impedance spectroscopy and voltammetry show the enhanced interaction of leukemia cells using the drug/lipid modified sensor probe. As the number of leukemia cells increased, the charge transfer resistance (Rct) in impedance spectra increased and the amine oxidation peak current of drug molecules in voltammograms decreased at around 0.7-1.0V.

Dmin are rare in myeloid neoplasms and are generally associated with a poor prognosis. Most studies of dmin in myeloid neoplasms are case reports or small series. In the current study, we present the clinicopathologic and cytogenetic features of 22 patients with myeloid neoplasms harboring dmin. These neoplasms included acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 18), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (n = 3), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (n = 1). The AML cases consisted of AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (n = 13) and therapy-related AML (n = 5). Dmin were detected in initial pre-therapy samples in 14 patients with AML or CMML; they were acquired during the disease course in 8 patients who had AML or MDS. The presence of dmin was associated with micronuclei (18/18; 100%), complex karyotype (17/22; 77.3%), and amplification of MYC (12/16; 75%) or MLL (4/16; 25%). Immunohistochemical staining for MYC performed on bone marrow core biopsy or clot sections revealed increased MYC protein in all 19 cases tested. Except for one patient, most patients failed to respond to risk-adapted chemotherapies. At last follow up, all patients had died of disease after a median of 5 months following dmin detection. In conclusion, dmin in myeloid neoplasms commonly harbor MYC or MLL gene amplification and manifest as micronuclei within leukemic blasts. Dmin are often associated with myelodysplasia or therapy-related disease, and complex karyotypes.","['Huh, Yang O', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Talwalkar, Sameer S', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Ohanian, Maro', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V']","['Huh YO', 'Tang G', 'Talwalkar SS', 'Khoury JD', 'Ohanian M', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Abruzzo LV']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

In the present research, we cloned the chimeric multi-epitope gene X into the eukaryotic expression vector pVAX1 to evaluate its potency as a DNA vaccine. The purified recombinant gp85 protein and rCMEPX were used as positive controls and a DNA prime-protein boost strategy was also studied. Six experimental groups of 7-day-old chickens (20 per group) were immunized intramuscularly three times at 2weeks interval with PBS, gp85, rCMEPX, pVAX1, pVAX-X and pVAX-X+rCMEPX respectively. The antibody titers and cellular immune responses were assayed after immunization. The efficacy of immunoprotection against the challenge of ALV-J NX0101 strain was also examined. The results showed that the DNA vaccine could elicit both neutralizing antibodies and cellular responses. Immune-challenge experiments showed good protection efficacy against ALV-J infection. Particularly, the regimen involving one priming pVAX-X and twice recombinant rCMEPX boosting, induced the highest antibody titers in all immunized groups. Our results suggest that the constructed chimeric multi-epitope DNA has potential for a candidate vaccine against ALV-J when used in proper prime-boost combinations.

We investigated 19 synthetic curcumin derivatives in drug-sensitive acute lymphoblastic CCRF-CEM leukemia cells and their multidrug-resistant P-gp-overexpressing subline, CEM/ADR5000. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity was tested by resazurin assays. Doxorubicin uptake was assessed by flow cytometry. Binding modes of compounds to P-gp were analyzed by molecular docking. Chemical features responsible for bioactivity were studied by quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses. A 7-descriptor QSAR model was correlated with doxorubicin uptake values, IC50 values and binding energies. RESULTS: The compounds displayed IC50 values between 0.7+/-0.03 and 20.2+/-0.25muM. CEM/ADR5000 cells exhibited cross-resistance to 10 compounds, collateral sensitivity to three compounds and regular sensitivity to the remaining six curcumins. Molecular docking studies at the intra-channel transmembrane domain of human P-gp resulted in lowest binding energies ranging from -9.00+/-0.10 to -6.20+/-0.02kcal/mol and pKi values from 0.24+/-0.04 to 29.17+/-0.88muM. At the ATP-binding site of P-gp, lowest binding energies ranged from -9.78+/-0.17 to -6.79+/-0.01kcal/mol and pKi values from 0.07+/-0.02 to 0.03+/-0.03muM. CEM/ADR5000 cells accumulated approximately 4-fold less doxorubicin than CCRF-CEM cells. The control P-gp inhibitor, verapamil, partially increased doxorubicin uptake in CEM/ADR5000 cells. Six curcumins increased doxorubicin uptake in resistant cells or even exceeded uptake levels compared to sensitive one. QSAR yielded good activity prediction (R=0.797 and R=0.794 for training and test sets). CONCLUSION: Selected derivatives may serve to guide future design of novel P-gp inhibitors and collateral sensitive drugs to combat MDR.","['Ooko, Edna', 'Alsalim, Tahseen', 'Saeed, Bahjat', 'Saeed, Mohamed E M', 'Kadioglu, Onat', 'Abbo, Hanna S', 'Titinchi, Salam J J', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Ooko E', 'Alsalim T', 'Saeed B', 'Saeed MEM', 'Kadioglu O', 'Abbo HS', 'Titinchi SJJ', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudinger Weg 5, 55128 Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry, College of Education for Pure Sciences, University of Basrah, P.O.

Here, we report that there are differences in the DNA methylation patterns seen in normal peripheral blood and two T-cell leukemia cell lines. We identify nine genes (CLEC4E, CR1, DBC1, EPO, HAL-DOA, IGF2, IL12B, ITGA1, and LMX1B) that are significantly hypermethylated in T-cell leukemias cell lines, and suggest that aberrant hypermethylation of these normally unmethylated genes may induce their transcriptional and expressional silencing. Furthermore, we observed that the expression levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3a were significantly decreased by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC), which is a demethylation agent known to deplete DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in leukemia cancer cells and restore the expression levels of their target genes in Jurkat cells. This result suggests that the overexpression of DNMTs could contribute to the development of T-cell leukemias by inducing hypermethylation of the target genes. Together, our results show that aberrant hypermethylation is an important molecular mechanism in the progression of T-cell leukemias, and thus could prove useful as a prognostic and/or diagnostic marker. Moreover, 5-Aza-dC might be a promising candidate for the treatment of T-cell leukemia.","['Kim, Sun Young', 'Shin, Dong-Yeop', 'Kim, Sang-Man', 'Lee, Minyoung', 'Kim, Eun Ju']","['Kim SY', 'Shin DY', 'Kim SM', 'Lee M', 'Kim EJ']","['Division of Radiation Effect, Korea Institute of Radiological & Medical Sciences, Seoul 01812, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul 03080, Korea.', 'Health Services Management, KH School of Management, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 02453, Korea.', 'Division of Radiation Effect, Korea Institute of Radiological & Medical Sciences, Seoul 01812, Korea.

The immediate post-transplantation course in T cell-replete peripheral blood haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-HCT) is often complicated by symptoms resembling cytokine-release syndrome (CRS), previously described in recipients of targeted cellular therapeutics. However, we know little about the incidence and impact of CRS on outcomes in these patients. To understand this syndrome in haplo-HCT patients, we reviewed data from 75 consecutive patients who received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized T cell-replete peripheral blood haplo-HCT at a single center. Using CRS criteria described in recipients of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies, we found 65 of 75 (87%) met criteria for CRS, although most cases were only mild (grades 1 or 2). However, 9 patients (12%) experienced severe (grades 3 or 4) CRS. Median survival was 2.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], .43 to 5.8) in patients with severe CRS, compared with 13.1 months (95% CI, 8.1 to not reached) in patients with mild CRS. Transplantation-related mortality was worse in the severe CRS cohort with a hazard ratio of 4.59 (95% CI, 1.43 to 14.67) compared with that in the mild CRS cohort. Severe CRS patients had a significant delay in median time for neutrophil engraftment. Serum IL-6 levels were measured in 10 haplo-HCT patients and were elevated in the early post-transplantation setting. Seven patients with CRS were treated with tocilizumab, resulting in a complete resolution of their CRS symptoms. Severe CRS represents a potential complication of peripheral blood haplo-HCT and is associated with worse outcomes. Anti-IL-6 receptor therapy is associated with rapid resolution of the CRS symptoms.","['Abboud, Ramzi', 'Keller, Jesse', 'Slade, Michael', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'Rettig, Michael P', 'Meier, Stephanie', 'Fehniger, Todd A', 'Abboud, Camille N', 'Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Vij, Ravi', 'Trinkaus, Kathryn M', 'Schroeder, Mark A', 'Romee, Rizwan']","['Abboud R', 'Keller J', 'Slade M', 'DiPersio JF', 'Westervelt P', 'Rettig MP', 'Meier S', 'Fehniger TA', 'Abboud CN', 'Uy GL', 'Vij R', 'Trinkaus KM', 'Schroeder MA', 'Romee R']","['BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.', 'BMT and Leukemia Program, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri.

We have reported that a single inhaled treatment with a synergistic combination of Toll-like receptor 2/6 (TLR 2/6) and TLR9 agonists (Pam2-ODN) induces protective mucosal defenses in mice against a broad range of pathogens. As Pam2-ODN-induced protection persists despite depletion of several leukocyte populations, we tested whether it could prevent pneumonia in a mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remission induction therapy. Pam2-ODN prevented death due to pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Aspergillus fumigatus when mice were heavily engrafted with leukemia cells, had severe chemotherapy-induced neutropenia or both. Pam2-ODN also extended survival of pneumonia in NSG mice engrafted with primary human AML cells. Protection was associated with rapid pathogen killing in the lungs at the time of infection and with reduced pathogen burdens at distant sites at the end of observation. Pathogen killing was inducible directly from isolated lung epithelial cells and was not abrogated by the presence of leukemia cells or cytotoxic agents. Pam2-ODN had no discernible effect on replication rate, total tumor population, or killing by chemotherapy of mouse or human leukemia cells, either in vitro or in vivo. Taken together, we report that therapeutic stimulation of lung epithelial defenses robustly protects against otherwise lethal pneumonias despite the profound immune dysfunction associated with acute leukemia and its treatment. These findings may suggest an opportunity to protect this population during periods of peak vulnerability.","['Leiva-Juarez, Miguel M', 'Ware, Hayden H', 'Kulkarni, Vikram V', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick A', 'Tuvim, Michael J', 'Evans, Scott E']","['Leiva-Juarez MM', 'Ware HH', 'Kulkarni VV', 'Zweidler-McKay PA', 'Tuvim MJ', 'Evans SE']","['Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, and.', 'Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, and.', 'Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, and.', 'Division of Pediatrics, Department of Leukemia and Lymphoma, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, and.', 'Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, and University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160617,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Infective Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Lung/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Pneumonia/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Sheep']",,,2016/06/19 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/06/19 06:00'],"['2016/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34238-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-03-708511 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Aug 18;128(7):982-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-03-708511.

Recently, mutations of the SETD2 and DNMT3A genes were identified in patients exhibiting only some Sotos syndrome features. Both NSD1 and SETD2 genes encode epigenetic 'writer' proteins that catalyse methylation of histone 3 lysine 36 (H3K36me). The DNMT3A gene encodes an epigenetic 'reader' protein of the H3K36me chromatin mark. METHODS: We aimed at confirming the implication of DNMT3A and SETD2 mutations in an overgrowth phenotype, through a comprehensive targeted-next generation sequencing (NGS) screening in 210 well-phenotyped index cases with a Sotos-like phenotype and no NSD1 mutation, from a French cohort. RESULTS: Six unreported heterozygous likely pathogenic variants in DNMT3A were identified in seven patients: two nonsense variants and four de novo missense variants. One de novo unreported heterozygous frameshift variant was identified in SETD2 in one patient. All the four DNMT3A missense variants affected DNMT3A functional domains, suggesting a potential deleterious impact. DNMT3A-mutated index cases shared similar clinical features including overgrowth phenotype characterised by postnatal tall stature (>/=+2SD), macrocephaly (>/=+2SD), overweight or obesity at older age, intellectual deficiency and minor facial features. The phenotype associated with SETD2 mutations remains to be described more precisely. The p.Arg882Cys missense de novo constitutional DNMT3A variant found in two patients is the most frequent DNMT3A somatic mutation in acute leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the power of targeted NGS to identify rare disease-causing variants. These observations provided evidence for a unifying mechanism (disruption of apposition and reading of the epigenetic chromatin mark H3K36me) that causes an overgrowth syndrome phenotype. Further studies are needed in order to assess the role of SETD2 and DNMT3A in intellectual deficiency without overgrowth.","['Tlemsani, Camille', 'Luscan, Armelle', 'Leulliot, Nicolas', 'Bieth, Eric', 'Afenjar, Alexandra', 'Baujat, Genevieve', 'Doco-Fenzy, Martine', 'Goldenberg, Alice', 'Lacombe, Didier', 'Lambert, Laetitia', 'Odent, Sylvie', 'Pasche, Jerome', 'Sigaudy, Sabine', 'Buffet, Alexandre', 'Violle-Poirsier, Celine', 'Briand-Suleau, Audrey', 'Laurendeau, Ingrid', 'Chin, Magali', 'Saugier-Veber, Pascale', 'Vidaud, Dominique', 'Cormier-Daire, Valerie', 'Vidaud, Michel', 'Pasmant, Eric', 'Burglen, Lydie']","['Tlemsani C', 'Luscan A', 'Leulliot N', 'Bieth E', 'Afenjar A', 'Baujat G', 'Doco-Fenzy M', 'Goldenberg A', 'Lacombe D', 'Lambert L', 'Odent S', 'Pasche J', 'Sigaudy S', 'Buffet A', 'Violle-Poirsier C', 'Briand-Suleau A', 'Laurendeau I', 'Chin M', 'Saugier-Veber P', 'Vidaud D', 'Cormier-Daire V', 'Vidaud M', 'Pasmant E', 'Burglen L']","['Service de Genetique et Biologie Moleculaires, Hopital Cochin, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'EA7331, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Service de Genetique et Biologie Moleculaires, Hopital Cochin, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'EA7331, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Pharmacie, Laboratoire de Cristallographie et RMN Biologiques-CNRS UMR-8015, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Service de Genetique, Hopital Purpan, Toulouse, France.', 'Departement de Genetique, Centre de reference des anomalies du developpement et syndromes malformatifs, Hopital Trousseau, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR_1163, Departement de Genetique, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Institut Imagine, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Service de genetique HMB CHU Reims, EA 3801, SFR CAPSANTE, Reims, France.', 'Service de Genetique, Centre Normand de Genomique Medicale et Medecine personnalisee, CHU de Rouen, Rouen, France.', 'Service de Genetique, CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Service de Genetique, CHU, Nancy, France.', 'Service de Genetique, CHU, Rennes, France.', 'Service de Pediatrie, Centre Hospitalier de Polynesie francaise, Papeete, Tahiti, France.', 'Service de Genetique, CHU de Marseille-Hopital de la Timone, Marseille, France.', ""Service d'Endocrinologie, Maladies Metaboliques, Nutrition, Hopital Larrey, Toulouse, France."", 'Departement de Genetique, CHU de Reims, Reims, France.', 'Service de Genetique et Biologie Moleculaires, Hopital Cochin, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'EA7331, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'EA7331, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Service de Genetique, Centre Normand de Genomique Medicale et Medecine personnalisee, CHU de Rouen, Rouen, France.', 'Inserm U1079, Universite de Rouen, IRIB, Rouen, France.', 'Service de Genetique et Biologie Moleculaires, Hopital Cochin, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'EA7331, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Departement de Genetique, Centre de reference des anomalies du developpement et syndromes malformatifs, Hopital Trousseau, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Service de Genetique et Biologie Moleculaires, Hopital Cochin, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'EA7331, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Service de Genetique et Biologie Moleculaires, Hopital Cochin, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'EA7331, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Departement de Genetique, Centre de reference des anomalies du developpement et syndromes malformatifs, Hopital Trousseau, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'INSERM UMR_1141, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160617,England,J Med Genet,Journal of medical genetics,2985087R,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNMT3A', 'H3K36me3', 'Overgrowth', 'SETD2', 'Sotos syndrome']",2016/06/19 06:00,2016/06/19 06:01,['2016/06/19 06:00'],"['2015/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/19 06:01 [medline]', '2016/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['jmedgenet-2015-103638 [pii]', '10.1136/jmedgenet-2015-103638 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Genet. 2016 Nov;53(11):743-751. doi: 10.1136/jmedgenet-2015-103638.

In particular, dendritic cells (DCs) are functionally defective in patients with CLL. To understand the molecular mechanism for this abnormality, we focused on signal transduction pathways that regulate the function of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). Monocytes from CLL patients exhibit high IL-4Ralpha expression due to the enhanced activation of STAT3. However, IL-4R signaling is decoupled from activation of its downstream mediator STAT6 by enhanced levels of the negative regulator SOCS5. This impairs differentiation of functionally mature DCs leading to decreased expression of HLA-DR and costimulatory molecules, and reduced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-activated DCs. Moreover, Mo-DCs from CLL patients display a decreased ability to induce pro-inflammatory T-cell responses. IL-10-treatment of monocytes from healthy donors mimics the alteration in signaling observed in CLL patients, through enhanced STAT3-dependent expression of SOCS5. The higher level of SOCS5 inhibits STAT6 activation and leads to defective DC differentiation. These findings indicate that SOCS5 mediates the impaired function of DCs in CLL patients, and has the potential to be a new therapeutic target for reversing cancer-associated immune suppression.","['Toniolo, Patricia A', 'Liu, Suhu', 'Yeh, Jennifer E', 'Ye, Darwin Q', 'Barbuto, Jose Alexandre M', 'Frank, David A']","['Toniolo PA', 'Liu S', 'Yeh JE', 'Ye DQ', 'Barbuto JA', 'Frank DA']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', ""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (SOCS5 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*immunology/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'SOCS5', 'STAT3', 'dendritic cells', 'monocytes']",2016/06/19 06:00,2018/01/30 06:00,['2016/06/19 06:00'],"['2015/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10093 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10093 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 19;7(29):46301-46314. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10093.,10.18632/oncotarget.10093 [doi],['R01 CA160979/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5216799,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we performed a cell-based small molecule library screen on an infant MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) cell line, PER-485, in order to identify selective inhibitors for MLL-r leukemia. After screening initial hits for a cytotoxic effect against a panel of 30 cell lines including MLL-r and MLL wild-type (MLL-wt) leukemia, solid tumours and control cells, small molecule CCI-007 was identified as a compound that selectively and significantly decreased the viability of a subset of MLL-r and related leukemia cell lines with CALM-AF10 and SET-NUP214 translocation. CCI-007 induced a rapid caspase-dependent apoptosis with mitochondrial depolarization within twenty-four hours of treatment. CCI-007 altered the characteristic MLL-r gene expression signature in sensitive cells with downregulation of the expression of HOXA9, MEIS1, CMYC and BCL2, important drivers in MLL-r leukemia, within a few hours of treatment. MLL-r leukemia cells that were resistant to the compound were characterised by significantly higher baseline gene expression levels of MEIS1 and BCL2 in comparison to CCI-007 sensitive MLL-r leukemia cells.In conclusion, we have identified CCI-007 as a novel small molecule that displays rapid toxicity towards a subset of MLL-r, CALM-AF10 and SET-NUP214 leukemia cell lines. Our findings suggest an important new avenue in the development of targeted therapies for these deadly diseases and indicate that different therapeutic strategies might be needed for different subtypes of MLL-r leukemia.","['Somers, Klaartje', 'Chudakova, Daria A', 'Middlemiss, Shiloh M C', 'Wen, Victoria W', 'Clifton, Molly', 'Kwek, Alan', 'Liu, Bing', 'Mayoh, Chelsea', 'Bongers, Angelika', 'Karsa, Mawar', 'Pan, Sukey', 'Cruikshank, Sarah', 'Scandlyn, Marissa', 'Hoang, Wendi', 'Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Gudkov, Andrei V', 'Chernova, Olga B', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Norris, Murray D', 'Henderson, Michelle J']","['Somers K', 'Chudakova DA', 'Middlemiss SM', 'Wen VW', 'Clifton M', 'Kwek A', 'Liu B', 'Mayoh C', 'Bongers A', 'Karsa M', 'Pan S', 'Cruikshank S', 'Scandlyn M', 'Hoang W', 'Imamura T', 'Kees UR', 'Gudkov AV', 'Chernova OB', 'Haber M', 'Norris MD', 'Henderson MJ']","[""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Department of Cell Stress Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Oncotartis, Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (AF10-CALM fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Histone Chaperones/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['CALM-AF10 leukemia', 'HOXA9/MEIS pathway', 'MLL-rearranged leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'small molecule']",2016/06/19 06:00,2018/01/09 06:00,['2016/06/19 06:00'],"['2015/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10022 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10022 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 19;7(29):46067-46087. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10022.,10.18632/oncotarget.10022 [doi],,PMC5216782,"['The authors declare the following competing interests: Chernova O.B. is an', 'employee and Gudkov A.V. is a consultant of Oncotartis, Inc. which has licensed', ""the CCI-007 compound from the Children's Cancer Institute.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the Nrf2-Kelch ECH associating protein 1 (Keap1) pathway has been associated with cancer drug resistance attributable to modulation of the expression and activation of antioxidant and detoxification enzymes. However, the exact mechanisms by which Nrf2 activation results in chemoresistance are insufficiently understood to date. This study investigated the mechanisms by which the cytotoxic effects of arsenic trioxide (ATO), an anticancer drug, were decreased in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells treated with CA, a typical activator of Nrf2 used to stimulate the Nrf2/Keap1 system. Our findings suggest that arsenic is non-enzymatically incorporated into NB4 cells and forms complexes that are dependent on intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations. In addition, the arsenic complexes are recognized as substrates by multidrug resistance proteins and subsequently excreted from the cells. Therefore, Nrf2-associated activation of the GSH biosynthetic pathway, followed by increased levels of intracellular GSH, are key mechanisms underlying accelerated arsenic efflux and attenuation of the cytotoxic effects of ATO.","['Nishimoto, Shoichi', 'Suzuki, Toshihiro', 'Koike, Shin', 'Yuan, Bo', 'Takagi, Norio', 'Ogasawara, Yuki']","['Nishimoto S', 'Suzuki T', 'Koike S', 'Yuan B', 'Takagi N', 'Ogasawara Y']","['Department of Analytical Biochemistry, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, 2-522-1 Noshio, Kiyose, Tokyo 204-8588, Japan.', 'Department of Analytical Biochemistry, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, 2-522-1 Noshio, Kiyose, Tokyo 204-8588, Japan.', 'Department of Analytical Biochemistry, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, 2-522-1 Noshio, Kiyose, Tokyo 204-8588, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Applied Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Analytical Biochemistry, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, 2-522-1 Noshio, Kiyose, Tokyo 204-8588, Japan.

The majority of infected animals are asymptomatic, one to five percent develop lymphoma and from 30 to 50% present a persistent lymphocytosis. The virus occurs naturally in cattle and experimentally in buffaloes, capybaras and rabbits. The occurrence of lymphoma in buffaloes has been attributed to BLV infection by some authors in India and Venezuela, but not confirmed by other studies and little information on natural BLV infection in buffaloes is available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of BLV in a sub-sample of buffalo from Amazon and southeast regions in Brazil. Three hundred and fifteen serum samples were negative using commercial AGID and ELISA (ELISA-gp51) which detect anti-BLV glycoprotein gp51 antibodies. The same samples were also evaluated for antibodies to whole virus through a commercial ELISA (ELISA-BLV) in which 77 (24.44%) were found seropositive and two (0.63%) inconclusive. On the other hand, all animals were negative by PCR to BLV targeted to the env and tax genes. These results suggest that ELISA-BLV produces false positive results in buffalo serum (p<0.001). In addition, one buffalo lymphoma sample was negative in both PCR assays used in this study. BLV was not detected in buffaloes from the Amazon basin and the southeast region of Brazil. Serological tests, like ELISA-BLV, usually used for cattle may produce false-positive results for BLV in buffaloes and direct detection tests such as PCR should be chosen in these surveys. The occurrence of lymphoma in buffalo was not associated with BLV infection in the one case analyzed in this work and the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease should be clarified.","['De Oliveira, Cairo H S', 'Resende, Claudia F', 'Oliveira, Carlos M C', 'Barbosa, Jose D', 'Fonseca, Antonio A Junior', 'Leite, Romulo C', 'Reis, Jenner K P']","['De Oliveira CH', 'Resende CF', 'Oliveira CM', 'Barbosa JD', 'Fonseca AA Junior', 'Leite RC', 'Reis JK']","['Laboratorio de Retroviroses, Escola de Veterinaria, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil; Setor de Medicina Veterinaria Preventiva, Escola de Veterinaria e Zootecnia, Universidade Federal de Goias, Goiania, Goias, Brazil.

To meet the challenges of preclinical and clinical production, different steps of the production process of self-inactivating gamma-retroviral (RVs) and lentiviral vectors (LVs) have been improved (e.g., transfection, media optimization, cell culture conditions). However, the increasing need for mass production of such vectors is still a challenge and could hamper their availability for therapeutic use. Recently, we observed that the use of a neutral pH during vector production is not optimal. The use of mildly acidic pH conditions (pH 6) can increase by two- to threefold the production of RVs and LVs pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) or gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) glycoproteins. Here, we describe the production protocol in mildly acidic pH conditions of GALVTR- and VSV-G-pseudotyped LVs using the transient transfection of HEK293T cells and the production protocol of GALV-pseudotyped RVs produced from a murine producer cell line.

In flow cytometry, these approaches rely on the use of fluorescent substrates of transporters. Compounds which prevent the loss of cell fluorescence have typically been pursued as inhibitors of specific transporters, but further drug development has been largely unsuccessful. One possible reason for this low success rate could be a substantial overlap in substrate specificities and functions between transporters of different families. Additionally, the fluorescent substrates are often synthetic dyes that exhibit promiscuity among transporters as well. Here, we describe an assay in which a fluorescent analog of a natural metabolite, 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (F-cAMP), is actively effluxed by malignant leukemia cells. The F-cAMP is loaded into the cell cytoplasm using a procedure based on the osmotic lysis of pinocytic vesicles. The flow cytometric analysis of the fluorescence retained in F-cAMP-loaded cells incubated with various compounds can subsequently identify inhibitors of cyclic AMP efflux (ICE).","['Perez, Dominique', 'Simons, Peter C', 'Smagley, Yelena', 'Sklar, Larry A', 'Chigaev, Alexandre']","['Perez D', 'Simons PC', 'Smagley Y', 'Sklar LA', 'Chigaev A']","['University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Center for Molecular Discovery, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA.', 'University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Center for Molecular Discovery, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA.', 'University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Center for Molecular Discovery, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA.', 'University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Center for Molecular Discovery, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, 87131, USA.

Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for AML but one of the major complications is that current drugs are highly toxic and poorly tolerated. In general, treatment for AML consists of induction chemotherapy and post-remission therapy. If no further post-remission is given, almost all patients will eventually relapse. Histamine, acting at histamine type-2 (H2) receptors on phagocytes and AML blast cells, helps prevent the production and release of oxygen-free radicals, thereby protecting NK and cytotoxic T cells. This protection allows immune-stimulating agents, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), to activate cytotoxic cells more effectively, enhancing the killing of tumor cells. Based on this mechanism, post-remission therapy with histamine and IL-2 was found to significantly prevent relapse of AML. Alternatively, another potentially less toxic approach to treat AML employs drugs to induce differentiation of malignant cells. It is based on the assumption that many neoplastic cell types exhibit reversible defects in differentiation, which upon appropriate treatment results in tumor reprogramming and the induction of terminal differentiation. There are promissory results showing that an elevated and sustained signaling through H2 receptors is able to differentiate leukemia-derived cell lines, opening the door for the use of H2 agonists for specific differentiation therapies. In both situations, histamine acting through H2 receptors constitutes an eligible treatment to induce leukemic cell differentiation, improving combined therapies.","['Monczor, Federico', 'Copsel, Sabrina', 'Fernandez, Natalia', 'Davio, Carlos', 'Shayo, Carina']","['Monczor F', 'Copsel S', 'Fernandez N', 'Davio C', 'Shayo C']","['Instituto de Investigaciones Farmacologicas, ININFA, Universidad de Buenos Aires-Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, CONICET, Junin 956 PP, (1113), Buenos Aires, Argentina. monczorf@ffyb.uba.ar.', 'Microbiology and Immunology Department, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Farmacologicas, ININFA, Universidad de Buenos Aires-Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, CONICET, Junin 956 PP, (1113), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Farmacologicas, ININFA, Universidad de Buenos Aires-Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas, CONICET, Junin 956 PP, (1113), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Patologia y Farmacologia Molecular, Instituto de Biologia y Medicina Experimental, CONICET, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Handb Exp Pharmacol,Handbook of experimental pharmacology,7902231,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Histamine H2)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)']",IM,"['Blood Cells/*metabolism', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Receptors, Histamine H2/*blood/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Cell differentiation', '*Chemotherapy', '*Histamine']",2016/06/19 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2016/06/19 06:00'],"['2016/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/164_2016_8 [doi]'],ppublish,Handb Exp Pharmacol. 2017;241:141-160. doi: 10.1007/164_2016_8.,10.1007/164_2016_8 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plasma clofarabine levels and pharmacokinetic parameters were monitored continuously for up to 8 hours after the single intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg at 12:00 noon and 12:00 midnight by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-UV method. Clofarabine toxicity in all groups fluctuated in accordance with circadian rhythms in vivo. The toxicity of clofarabine in mice in the rest phase was more severe than the active one, indicated by more severe liver damage, immunodepression, higher mortality rate, and lower LD50. No significant pharmacokinetic parameter changes were observed between the night and daytime treatment groups. These findings suggest the dosing-time dependent toxicity of clofarabine synchronizes with the circadian rhythm of mice, which might provide new therapeutic strategies in further clinical application.","['Luan, Jia-Jie', 'Zhang, Yu-Shan', 'Liu, Xiao-Yun', 'Wang, Ya-Qin', 'Zuo, Jian', 'Song, Jian-Guo', 'Zhang, Wen', 'Wang, Wu-San']","['Luan JJ', 'Zhang YS', 'Liu XY', 'Wang YQ', 'Zuo J', 'Song JG', 'Zhang W', 'Wang WS']","['Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China; Department of Pharmacy, Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.', ""Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China; Department of Pharmacy, Chinese People's Liberation Army 150th Central Hospital, Luoyang, China."", 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China; Department of Pharmacy, Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China; Department of Pharmacy, Yijishan Hospital of Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, China.

However, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), GTG-banding results are hampered by a low mitotic rate of the corresponding malignant lymphatic cells. Thus, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) for the detection of specific cytogenetic aberrations is done nowadays as a supplement to or even instead of banding cytogenetics in many diagnostic laboratories. These iFISH studies can be performed on native blood or bone marrow smears or in nuclei after cultivation and stimulation by a suitable mitogen. As there are only few comparative studies with partially conflicting results for the detection rates of aberrations in cultivated and native cells, this question was studied in 38 CLL cases with known aberrations in 11q22.2, 11q22.3, 12, 13q14.3, 14q32.33, 17p13.1, or 18q21.32. The obtained results implicate that iFISH directly applied on smears is in general less efficient for the detection of CLL-specific genetic abnormalities than for cultivated cells. This also shows that applied cell culture conditions are well suited for malignant CLL cells. Thus, to detect malignant aberrant cells in CLL, cell cultivation and cytogenetic workup should be performed and the obtained material should be subjected to banding cytogenetics and iFISH.","['Alhourani, Eyad', 'Aroutiounian, Rouben', 'Harutyunyan, Tigran', 'Glaser, Anita', 'Schlie, Cordula', 'Pohle, Beate', 'Liehr, Thomas']","['Alhourani E', 'Aroutiounian R', 'Harutyunyan T', 'Glaser A', 'Schlie C', 'Pohle B', 'Liehr T']","['Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany (EA, AG, CS, BP, TL)', 'Department of Genetics and Cytology, Yerevan State University, Yerevan, Armenia (RA, TH)', 'Department of Genetics and Cytology, Yerevan State University, Yerevan, Armenia (RA, TH)', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany (EA, AG, CS, BP, TL)', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany (EA, AG, CS, BP, TL)', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany (EA, AG, CS, BP, TL)', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany (EA, AG, CS, BP, TL)']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160617,United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",['NOTNLM'],"['*TPA stimulation and cell cultivation', '*blood or bone marrow smears', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', '*interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH)']",2016/06/19 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,['2016/06/19 06:00'],"['2016/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['0022155416655086 [pii]', '10.1369/0022155416655086 [doi]']",ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 2016 Aug;64(8):495-501. doi: 10.1369/0022155416655086.

A Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) analysis.,3005-3014,"BACKGROUND: Patients with FMS like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a poor prognosis and are referred for early allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). METHODS: Data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) were used to evaluate 511 adult patients with de novo AML who underwent HCT during 2008 through 2011 to determine whether FLT3 mutations had an impact on HCT outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 158 patients (31%) had FLT3 mutations. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed an increased risk of relapse at 3 years in the FLT3 mutated group compared with the wild-type (WT) group (38% [95% confidence interval (CI), 30%-45%] vs 28% [95% CI, 24%-33%]; P = .04; relative risk, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.15-2.22]; P = .0048). However, FLT3 mutation status was not significantly associated with nonrelapse mortality, leukemia-free survival, or overall survival. Although more patients in the FLT3 mutated group died from relapsed primary disease compared with those in the WT group (60% vs 46%), the 3-year overall survival rate was comparable for the 2 groups (mutated group: 49%; 95% CI, 40%-57%; WT group: 55%, 95% CI, 50%-60%; P = .20). CONCLUSIONS: The current data indicate that FLT3 mutation status did not adversely impact overall survival after HCT, and about 50% of patients with this mutation who underwent HCT were long-term survivors.

These off-target effects can result from seed matches to unintended gene targets (reagent-based) or cellular pathways, which can compensate for gene perturbations (biology-based). We focus on the biology-based effects and use network modeling tools to discover pathways de novo around RNAi hits. By looking at hits in a functional context, we can uncover novel biology not identified from any individual 'omics measurement. We leverage multiple 'omic measurements using the Simultaneous Analysis of Multiple Networks (SAMNet) computational framework to model a genome scale shRNA screen investigating Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) progression in vivo. Our network model is enriched for cellular processes associated with hematopoietic differentiation and homeostasis even though none of the individual 'omic sets showed this enrichment. The model identifies genes associated with the TGF-beta pathway and predicts a role in ALL progression for many genes without this functional annotation. We further experimentally validate the hidden genes - Wwp1, a ubiquitin ligase, and Hgs, a multi-vesicular body associated protein - for their role in ALL progression. Our ALL pathway model includes genes with roles in multiple types of leukemia and roles in hematological development. We identify a tumor suppressor role for Wwp1 in ALL progression. This work demonstrates that network integration approaches can compensate for off-target effects, and that these methods can uncover novel biology retroactively on existing screening data. We anticipate that this framework will be valuable to multiple functional genomic technologies - siRNA, shRNA, and CRISPR - generally, and will improve the utility of functional genomic studies.","['Wilson, Jennifer L', 'Dalin, Simona', 'Gosline, Sara', 'Hemann, Michael', 'Fraenkel, Ernest', 'Lauffenburger, Douglas A']","['Wilson JL', 'Dalin S', 'Gosline S', 'Hemann M', 'Fraenkel E', 'Lauffenburger DA']","['Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, 16-343, Cambridge MA 02139, USA. fraenkel@mit.edu lauffen@mit.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20160617,England,Integr Biol (Camb),Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro,101478378,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Computer Simulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', '*High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', '*Metabolic Networks and Pathways', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2016/06/18 06:00,2017/12/05 06:00,['2016/06/18 06:00'],"['2016/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c6ib00040a [doi]'],ppublish,Integr Biol (Camb). 2016 Jul 11;8(7):761-74. doi: 10.1039/c6ib00040a.

Sumoylation occurs in the nucleus and requires DNA binding by Ikaros. Sumoylated Ikaros is less effective than unsumoylated forms at inhibiting the expansion of murine leukemic cells, and Ikaros sumoylation is abundant in human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemic cells, but not in healthy peripheral blood leukocytes.

The present study conducted a content analysis of cancer-related articles in Japanese newspapers published in 2011. In total, 5,314 articles were identified and subsequently coded. Coding variables included cancer type, the cancer continuum, and topic of articles mentioning cancer. Approximately half mentioned at least one specific type of cancer, with the focus mostly on lung, leukemia, and breast. Stomach and colon cancers, which have the highest morbidity, were relatively underreported. The continuum received little attention, and was mentioned in only 11% of articles. Treatment was the most frequently mentioned part of the continuum, with prevention and screening mentioned only rarely. The most frequently mentioned topic was social issues. The findings suggest that cancer-related articles were found regularly throughout the year, meaning that they might be one of the most important sources of cancer information. However, they are affected by social issues and there were some imbalances in both cancer type and continuum. Considering the influence of newspapers, it would be helpful for providing more effective and accurate information to the public if Japanese newspapers increased mentions of specific types of common cancers and the cancer continuum, especially prevention.","['Miyawaki, Rina', 'Shibata, Ai', 'Ishii, Kaori', 'Oka, Koichiro']","['Miyawaki R', 'Shibata A', 'Ishii K', 'Oka K']","['a Faculty of Sport Sciences , Waseda University.', 'b Faculty of Health and Sport Sciences , University of Tsukuba.', 'a Faculty of Sport Sciences , Waseda University.', 'a Faculty of Sport Sciences , Waseda University.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160617,England,Health Commun,Health communication,8908762,,IM,"['Bibliometrics', 'Humans', 'Japan', '*Neoplasms', 'Newspapers as Topic/*statistics & numerical data']",,,2016/06/18 06:00,2018/03/24 06:00,['2016/06/18 06:00'],"['2016/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10410236.2016.1138391 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Commun. 2017 Apr;32(4):420-426. doi: 10.1080/10410236.2016.1138391.

In addition to regulating effector immune cells, where it recognizes a wide variety of pathogen-associated and nonpathogen-associated endogenous ligands, TLR2 is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Its role in HSCs, however, is not well understood. Furthermore, augmented TLR2 signaling is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome, an HSC disorder characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and a high risk of transformation to leukemia, suggesting that aberrant signaling through this receptor may have clinically significant effects on HSCs. Herein, we show that systemic exposure of mice to a TLR2 agonist leads to an expansion of bone marrow and spleen phenotypic HSCs and progenitors, but a loss of HSC self-renewal capacity. Treatment of chimeric animals shows that these effects are largely cell non-autonomous, with a minor contribution from cell-autonomous TLR2 signaling, and are in part mediated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Together, these data suggest that TLR2 ligand exposure influences HSC cycling and function via unique mechanisms from TLR4, and support an important role for TLR2 in the regulation of HSCs.","['Herman, A C', 'Monlish, D A', 'Romine, M P', 'Bhatt, S T', 'Zippel, S', 'Schuettpelz, L G']","['Herman AC', 'Monlish DA', 'Romine MP', 'Bhatt ST', 'Zippel S', 'Schuettpelz LG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160617,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Radiation Tolerance/drug effects/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/*agonists', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism/pharmacology']",,,2016/06/18 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/06/18 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201645 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2016.45 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2016 Jun 17;6:e437. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2016.45.,10.1038/bcj.2016.45 [doi],"['K08 HL118367/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 HD076224/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HD007499/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5141360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the standard for detecting chromosomal aberrations that reflect adverse and favorable outcome. This study revealed a new, simple, and fast diagnostic tool to detect pathological cells by measuring and imaging the fluorescence lifetime (FLT) using FLT imaging microscopy (FLIM) of the peripheral blood (PB) cells of B-CLL samples that were labeled with the DNA binder, DAPI. The FLT of DAPI in healthy individuals was found to be 2.66 +/- 0.12 ns. In contrast, PB cells of B-CLL and BM cells of B-ALL patients were characterized by a specific group distribution of the FLT values. The FLT of DAPI was divided into four subgroups, relative to 2.66 ns: short+, normal, prolonged, and prolonged+. These alterations could be related to different chromatin arrangements of B-CLL and B-ALL interphase nuclei. Notably, extremely long FLT of nuclear DAPI correlate with the presence of extra chromosome 12, while moderate increases compared to normal characterize the deletion of p53. Such correlations potentially enable a FLT-based rapid automatic diagnosis and classification of B-CLL even when the frequency of genetic and chromosomal abnormalities is low.

Here, we assessed the treatment and prognosis of pediatric R/R B-NHL in the rituximab era in Japan. METHODS: We collected information on patients with R/R B-NHL who were registered with the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG) B-NHL03 protocol, a nationwide multicenter trial for newly diagnosed patients. We assessed the treatment and outcome of 33 pediatric R/R B-NHL cases. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients received rituximab combination therapy as salvage treatment. R-ICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide), the most common regimen, was used in 22 patients as first-line salvage therapy. Twenty-three patients received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Among all 33 patients, 23 (70.0%) achieved partial remission or complete remission. Their 5-year overall survival rate was 48.5%, which was far superior to that in both our previous study and in another study on pediatric R/R B-NHL. Four toxic deaths associated with viral infection occurred after allogeneic HSCT following on rituximab combined salvage therapy. Risk factor multivariate analysis for survival in patients receiving rituximab combination therapy showed central nervous system combined relapse had inferior outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of pediatric R/R B-NHL in a Japanese cohort remained poor but is showing improvement in the rituximab era. Rituximab combination therapy is effective for R/R B-NHL patients who did not receive rituximab as primary treatment. We need to consider possible viral infections in allogeneic HSCT after rituximab treatment.","['Osumi, Tomoo', 'Mori, Tetsuya', 'Fujita, Naoto', 'Saito, Akiko M', 'Nakazawa, Atsuko', 'Tsurusawa, Masahito', 'Kobayashi, Ryoji']","['Osumi T', 'Mori T', 'Fujita N', 'Saito AM', 'Nakazawa A', 'Tsurusawa M', 'Kobayashi R']","[""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development."", 'Department of Pediatrics, St. Marianna University School of Medicine.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-Bomb Survivors Hospital.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center.', 'Department of Pathology, National Center for Child Health and Development.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ama City Hospital.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160617,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Rituximab/*administration & dosage', 'Salvage Therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*pediatric B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma', '*refractory', '*relapse', '*rituximab']",2016/06/18 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2016/06/18 06:00'],"['2015/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.26105 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Oct;63(10):1794-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26105.

BM-MSCs have been previously reported to promote the proliferation of leukemic cells. To further understand the molecular mechanisms of BM-MSC-induced proliferation of leukemic cells, the present study co-cultured acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Reh cells with BM-MSCs. The current study used methods including shRNA, flow cytometry, MTT, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, ELISA and western blotting. The data of the present study demonstrated that BMMSCs promote the proliferation of Reh cells and the NR2F2 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in BMMSCs following coculture. Additionally, it was demonstrated that shRNA knockdown of NR2F2 inhibited BMMSCinduced proliferation of Reh cells. Furthermore, following downregulation of NR2F2, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) secretion by BMMSCs was reduced. The present study demonstrated that NR2F2 mediates BMMSCinduced proliferation of Reh cells, partially via regulation of VEGFA. Disrupting microenvironmental support by targeting NR2F2 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for ALL.","['Zhu, Ni', 'Wang, Huafang', 'Wei, Jieping', 'Wang, Binsheng', 'Shan, Wei', 'Lai, Xiaoyu', 'Zhao, Yanmin', 'Yu, Jian', 'Huang, He']","['Zhu N', 'Wang H', 'Wei J', 'Wang B', 'Shan W', 'Lai X', 'Zhao Y', 'Yu J', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, P.R.

Asparaginase converts asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia. The accumulation of ammonia in the bloodstream leads to hyperammonemia, described as one of the most significant side effects of asparaginase therapy. Therefore, there is a need for asparaginase formulations with the potential to reduce hyperammonemia. We incorporated 2 % of therapeutic enzyme in albumin-based capsules. The presence of asparaginase in the interface of bovine serum albumin (BSA) capsules showed the ability to hydrolyze the asparagine and retain the forming ammonia at the surface of the capsules. The incorporation of Poloxamer 407 in the capsule formulation further increased the ratio aspartic acid/ammonia from 1.92 to 2.46 (and 1.10 from the free enzyme), decreasing the levels of free ammonia. This capacity to retain ammonia can be due to electrostatic interactions and retention of ammonia at the surface of the capsules. The developed BSA/asparaginase capsules did not cause significant cytotoxic effect on mouse leukemic macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. The new BSA/asparaginase capsules could potentially be used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia preventing hyperammonemia associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment with asparaginase.","['Tinoco, Ana', 'Ribeiro, Artur', 'Oliveira, Cesar', 'Parpot, Pier', 'Gomes, Andreia', 'Cavaco-Paulo, Artur']","['Tinoco A', 'Ribeiro A', 'Oliveira C', 'Parpot P', 'Gomes A', 'Cavaco-Paulo A']","['CEB-Centre of Biological Engineering, University of Minho, Campus de Gualtar, 4710-057, Braga, Portugal.', 'CEB-Centre of Biological Engineering, University of Minho, Campus de Gualtar, 4710-057, Braga, Portugal.', 'CBMA-Centre of Molecular and Environmental Biology, University of Minho, 4710-057, Braga, Portugal.', 'Centre of Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University of Minho, 4710-057, Braga, Portugal.', 'Centre of Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University of Minho, 4710-057, Braga, Portugal.', 'CBMA-Centre of Molecular and Environmental Biology, University of Minho, 4710-057, Braga, Portugal.', 'CEB-Centre of Biological Engineering, University of Minho, Campus de Gualtar, 4710-057, Braga, Portugal. artur@deb.uminho.pt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160617,Germany,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,8406612,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Capsules)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '7664-41-7 (Ammonia)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Ammonia/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Asparaginase/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Capsules/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Carriers/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Mice', 'RAW 264.7 Cells', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/*metabolism', '*Ultrasonography']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Ammonia retention', 'Asparaginase', 'Capsules', 'Ultrasound']",2016/10/21 06:00,2017/01/25 06:00,['2016/06/18 06:00'],"['2016/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00253-016-7668-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00253-016-7668-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Microbiol Biotechnol. 2016 Nov;100(22):9499-9508. doi: 10.1007/s00253-016-7668-4.

The present study examined the involvement of FZD9 promoter methylation in the downregulation of FZD9 expression in leukemia cells. The expression of the FZD9 gene was absent in various leukemic cell lines, while it was restored following treatment with DNA demethylating agent 5aza2'deoxycytidine. Bisulfite sequencing analysis of the FZD9 promoter region showed that it was partially methylated in cell lines in which FZD9 gene was not expressed. Thus, DNA methylation in the promoter region may lead to inactivation of the FZD9 gene, which may represent and aberration associated with leukemia, since DNA was not methylated in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Methylationspecific polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the promoter region of the FZD9 gene was frequently methylated in primary or relapse acute myeloid leukemia (52.9%; excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia); however, methylation was infrequent in Bcell acute lymphocytic leukemia (5.6%). In conclusion, the present study indicated that the methylation profile of the FZD9 gene corresponded to that of a candidate tumorsuppressor gene in acute myeloid leukemia.","['Zhang, Yingjie', 'Jiang, Qi', 'Kong, Xiaolin', 'Yang, Lili', 'Hu, Wanzhen', 'Lv, Chengfang', 'Li, Yinghua']","['Zhang Y', 'Jiang Q', 'Kong X', 'Yang L', 'Hu W', 'Lv C', 'Li Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150001, P.R.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study involving all patients admitted to hospitals in Western Australia with a haematological malignancy from July 2011 to June 2012. Hospital admission data were linked with all hospital investigated CDI case data. Potential risk factors were assessed by logistic regression. The risk of death within 60 and 90 days of CDI was assessed by Cox Proportional Hazards regression. RESULTS: There were 2085 patients of whom 65 had at least one CDI. Twenty percent of CDI cases were either community-acquired, indeterminate source or had only single-day admissions in the 28 days prior to CDI. Using logistic regression, having acute lymphocytic leukaemia, neutropenia and having had bacterial pneumonia or another bacterial infection were associated with CDI. CDI was associated with an increased risk of death within 60 and 90 days post CDI, but only two deaths had CDI recorded as an antecedent factor. Ribotyping information was available for 33 of the 65 CDIs. There were 19 different ribotypes identified. CONCLUSIONS: Neutropenia was strongly associated with CDI. While having CDI is a risk factor for death, in many cases it may not be a direct contributor to death but may reflect patients having higher morbidity. A wide variety of C. difficile ribotypes were found and community-acquired infection may be under-estimated in these patients.","['Selvey, Linda A', 'Slimings, Claudia', 'Joske, David J L', 'Riley, Thomas V']","['Selvey LA', 'Slimings C', 'Joske DJ', 'Riley TV']","['School of Public Health, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, WA Australia.', 'School of Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.', 'School of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.', 'Department of Microbiology, PathWest Laboratory Medicine, Nedlands, WA, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160617,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Aged', 'Australia', 'Clostridioides difficile/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Clostridium Infections/complications/*epidemiology/microbiology/*pathology', 'Cross Infection/epidemiology/microbiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*epidemiology/microbiology/*pathology', 'Hospitals', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,,2016/06/18 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/06/18 06:00'],"['2015/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0157839 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-54430 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jun 17;11(6):e0157839. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0157839. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0157839 [doi],,PMC4912117,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8493-0974'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comprehensive sequencing efforts have revealed a range of mutations characteristic, but not specific, of MDS. Epidemiologically, autoimmune diseases are common in patients with MDS, fueling hypotheses of common etiological mechanisms. Both innate and adaptive immune pathways are overly active in the hematopoietic niche of MDS. Although supportive care, growth factors, and hypomethylating agents are the mainstay of MDS treatment, some patients-especially younger low-risk patients with HLA-DR15 tissue type-demonstrate impressive response rates after immunosuppressive therapy. This is in contrast to higher-risk MDS patients, where several immune activating treatments, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, are in the pipeline. Thus, the dual role of immune mechanisms in MDS is challenging, and rigorous translational studies are needed to establish the value of immune manipulation as a treatment of MDS.","['Glenthoj, Andreas', 'Orskov, Andreas Due', 'Hansen, Jakob Werner', 'Hadrup, Sine Reker', ""O'Connell, Casey"", 'Gronbaek, Kirsten']","['Glenthoj A', 'Orskov AD', 'Hansen JW', 'Hadrup SR', ""O'Connell C"", 'Gronbaek K']","['Epi-/Genome Laboratory, Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen 2100, Denmark. angl@rh.dk.', 'Epi-/Genome Laboratory, Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen 2100, Denmark. a.oerskov@gmail.com.', 'Epi-/Genome Laboratory, Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen 2100, Denmark. jakobwerner@gmail.com.', 'Section for Immunology and Vaccinology, National Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark, Frederiksberg 1870, Denmark. sirha@vet.dtu.dk.', 'Jane Anne Nohl Division of Hematology, USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.

Thus, the current study presents a patient with t(8;22)(p11;q11) who was previously misdiagnosed with CML in the chronic phase. The current patient was a 26-year-old woman who was 4-weeks pregnant and in whom an increased white blood cell count (4.0x10(10)/l) was found upon physical examination. The patient had no history of hematological disease. Although cytogenetics showed a normal karyotype and no breakpoint cluster region/Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (BCR/ABL) fusion gene was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, a diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was initially made according to the clinical and morphological features. Another 6 weeks later, t(8;22)(p11;q11) rearrangement was present in 9 out of 10 analyzed metaphases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction indicated a negative result for the BCR/ABL fusion, but gave a positive result for the BCR-fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 fusion. A hematological diagnosis of atypical CML was again formed.","['Qin, You-Wen', 'Yang, Yi-Ning', 'Bai, Ping', 'Wang, Chun']","['Qin YW', 'Yang YN', 'Bai P', 'Wang C']","[""Department of Hematology, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Medical College, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200080, P.R.

Regarding the broad antitumor activity of arsenic, certain studies have been undertaken to test its efficacy in treating acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines and patients; however, to the best of our knowledge, no reports document that arsenic is able to induce the remission of T-ALL patients. The present study reports the case of young male patient diagnosed with T-ALL, with no significant response to common chemotherapy regimens, who finally achieved complete remission without minimal residual disease (as detected by flow cytometry) due to arsenic treatment. This result is encouraging, and the present study has shown that malignant TCRalphabeta(+) cell clones can be detected at the molecular level using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with the GeneScan technique. The result is mainly based on the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta1 clone (a 190-base pair PCR product that with the same complementarity determining region 3 length can be detected for all samples collected during various statuses) and on undetectable TCR Vgamma subfamily members, at the time of disease diagnosis. It is important to analyze the dynamically changing TCR pool in leukemia patients during therapy. Although the molecular mechanism through which arsenic contributes to malignant clone elimination remains unclear in the case presented, the use of arsenic is expected to be effective for clinically treating refractory and relapsed T-ALL patients.","['Wu, Suijing', 'Xu, Ling', 'Huang, Xin', 'Geng, Suxia', 'Xu, Yan', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Weng, Janyu', 'DU, Xin', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Wu S', 'Xu L', 'Huang X', 'Geng S', 'Xu Y', 'Chen S', 'Yang L', 'Wu X', 'Weng J', 'DU X', 'Li Y']","['Department of Hematology, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510080, P.R.

Recently, we investigated the in vitro effects of WWOX overexpression and observed marked growth arrest in human leukemia cells; however, the clinical characterization of WWOX in leukemia remains poorly investigated. The present study evaluated the WWOX expression profiles of 182 patients with leukemia of different types and 5 leukemic cell lines, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence analysis. The results found that WWOX mRNA and WWOX protein expression was significantly reduced or absent in the leukemia cases and cell lines compared with paired controls. The WWOX-positive rate was also lower in the leukemia cases compared with the rate of the normal controls. Notably, the WWOX level was reduced in newly diagnosed and relapsed cases, or in chronic myelogenous leukemia in the blastic phase, yet elevated in remission samples. Moreover, WWOX-negative cases exhibited WWOX expression restoration following induced remission. These findings suggest that WWOX may contribute to the occurrence and development of leukemia, and that it has potential to be a good biomarker or predictor for leukemia therapy.","['Luo, Lingqing', 'Chen, Yan', 'Cheng, Xiao', 'Lin, Yazhen', 'Fu, Xiaodan', 'Li, Dan', 'Cui, Zhaolei', 'Lin, Donghong']","['Luo L', 'Chen Y', 'Cheng X', 'Lin Y', 'Fu X', 'Li D', 'Cui Z', 'Lin D']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Tumor Biotherapy, Fujian Provincial Cancer Hospital, Teaching Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350014, P.R.

The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values of the three cell lines ranged between 0.9-126.4 microM and 0.3-11.7 microM at 24 and 48 h subsequent to exposure, respectively. The two lead compounds with sub-micromolar CC50 concentrations, 1-(2-methoxyethylthio-propionyl)-3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4 piperidone (2a) and 3,5-bis(4-fluorobenzylidene)-1-[3-(2-methoxyethyl sulfinyl)-propionyl]-4-piperidone (3e), were selected for additional analyses. Several strategies were undertaken to determine whether the above piperidones caused cell death via apoptosis or necrosis on T-lymphocyte leukemia Jurkat cells. The results revealed that the two piperidones caused phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial depolarization and activation of caspase-3, which are all biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis. In addition, the selected piperidones displayed selective cytotoxicity towards leukemia cells, and were less toxic in non-cancerous control cells. Therefore, the findings of the present study revealed that the novel piperidones 2a and 3e exert a selective cytotoxic effect on lymphocyte leukemia cells by favoring the activation of the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.","['Nunes, Larissa M', 'Hossain, Mohammad', 'Varela-Ramirez, Armando', 'DAS, Umashankar', 'Ayala-Marin, Yoshira M', 'Dimmock, Jonathan R', 'Aguilera, Renato J']","['Nunes LM', 'Hossain M', 'Varela-Ramirez A', 'DAS U', 'Ayala-Marin YM', 'Dimmock JR', 'Aguilera RJ']","['Cytometry, Imaging and Screening Core Facility, Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968-0519, USA.', 'Drug Discovery and Development Research Group, College of Pharmacy and Nutrition, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C9, Canada.', 'Cytometry, Imaging and Screening Core Facility, Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968-0519, USA.', 'Drug Discovery and Development Research Group, College of Pharmacy and Nutrition, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C9, Canada.', 'Cytometry, Imaging and Screening Core Facility, Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968-0519, USA.', 'Drug Discovery and Development Research Group, College of Pharmacy and Nutrition, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK S7N 5C9, Canada.', 'Cytometry, Imaging and Screening Core Facility, Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968-0519, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160420,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'piperidone']",2016/06/18 06:00,2016/06/18 06:01,['2016/06/18 06:00'],"['2015/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2016.4480 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-4480 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2016 Jun;11(6):3842-3848. doi: 10.3892/ol.2016.4480.

At the same time, wighteone, or 6-prenyl-5,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, a major isoflavone component of the ornamental tall tree Erythrina suberosa, has been demonstrated to exhibit a potent anti-proliferative effect on human leukemia HL-60 cancer cell lines. In this study, the effects of wighteone on the proliferation of HER2-positive breast cancer cells were investigated, and the action mechanism was explored. MCF-7 HER2-positive breast cancer cells were treated with various concentrations of wighteone. The growth inhibitory rate of the cells was calculated by MTT assay, apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, and the expression level of HSP90 was assessed by western blot analysis. The addition of wighteone at concentrations ranging from 1-10 g/ml in the medium for 48 h had a marked inhibition on the proliferation of HER2-positive cancer cell lines. The growth inhibitory rates with 0.5, 2 or 8 mM wighteone were significantly higher compared with the control group. Apoptosis in the wighteone-treated cells was also significantly higher compared with the control group. The expression level of HSP90 in the wighteone group was significantly lower than that in the control group. Our findings demonstrated that wighteone effectively inhibited the proliferation of HER2-positive cancer cell lines, and this is considered to be the result of downregulating HSP90 receptor and downstream signaling.","['Cao, Zhong-Wei', 'Zeng, Qian', 'Pei, Hai-Jiang', 'Ren, Li-Dong', 'Bai, Hai-Zhen', 'Na, Ri-Na']","['Cao ZW', 'Zeng Q', 'Pei HJ', 'Ren LD', 'Bai HZ', 'Na RN']","[""Department of Thyroid, Breast, Hernia and Vascular Surgery, The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Hospital, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region 010017, P.R.

The proposed method consists of three main parts: preprocessing, threshold segmentation, and postprocessing. In the preprocessing part, we get two images for further processing: one contrast-stretched gray image and one H component image from transformed HSV color space. In the threshold segmentation part, a dual-threshold method is proposed for improving the conventional single-threshold approaches and a golden section search method is used for determining the optimal thresholds. For the postprocessing part, mathematical morphology and median filtering are utilized to denoise and remove incomplete WBCs. The proposed method was tested in segmenting the lymphoblasts on a public Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) image dataset. The results show that the performance of the proposed method is better than single-threshold approach independently performed in RGB and HSV color space and the overall single WBC segmentation accuracy reaches 97.85%, showing a good prospect in subsequent lymphoblast classification and ALL diagnosis.","['Li, Yan', 'Zhu, Rui', 'Mi, Lei', 'Cao, Yihui', 'Yao, Di']","['Li Y', 'Zhu R', 'Mi L', 'Cao Y', 'Yao D']","[""State Key Laboratory of Transient Optics and Photonics, Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an 710119, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 52 Sanlihe Road, Beijing 100864, China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Transient Optics and Photonics, Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an 710119, China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Transient Optics and Photonics, Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an 710119, China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Transient Optics and Photonics, Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an 710119, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 52 Sanlihe Road, Beijing 100864, China."", 'Shenzhen Vivolight Medical Device and Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen 518000, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160522,United States,Comput Math Methods Med,Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,101277751,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Color', 'Computer Simulation', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes/*cytology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*diagnostic imaging', 'Software', 'User-Computer Interface']",,,2016/06/18 06:00,2017/03/11 06:00,['2016/06/18 06:00'],"['2015/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2016/9514707 [doi]'],ppublish,Comput Math Methods Med. 2016;2016:9514707. doi: 10.1155/2016/9514707.

We analyzed B lymphocytes from 57 patients with CLL and 11 healthy subjects. Different pathways were assessed for activation/expression of key signaling proteins. Data obtained were validated by Western blotting and confocal microscopy. The RPPA investigation and its validation, identified 3 series of proteins: 1) molecules whose expression levels reached statistically significant differences in CLL vs. healthy controls (HSP70, Smac/DIABLO, cleaved PARP, and cleaved caspase-6); 2) proteins with a positive trend of difference in CLL vs. healthy controls (HS1, gamma-tubulin, PKC alpha/beta-II Thr-638/641, p38 MAPK Thr-180/Tyr-182, NF-kappaB Ser-536, Bcl2 Ser-70 and Src Tyr-527); and 3) molecules differentially expressed in patients with IGHV mutations vs. those without mutations (ZAP70, PKC-zetalambda, Thr-410/403, and CD45).

However, the signals that regulate Nfatc1 expression are incompletely characterized. Here we show a developmental stage-specific differential expression pattern of Nfatc1 driven by the distal (P1) or proximal (P2) promoters in thymocytes. Whereas, preTCR-negative thymocytes exhibit only P2 promoter-derived Nfatc1beta expression, preTCR-positive thymocytes express both Nfatc1beta and P1 promoter-derived Nfatc1alpha transcripts. Inducing NFATc1alpha activity from P1 promoter in preTCR-negative thymocytes, in addition to the NFATc1beta from P2 promoter impairs thymocyte development resulting in severe T-cell lymphopenia. In addition, we show that NFATc1 activity suppresses the B-lineage potential of immature thymocytes, and consolidates their differentiation to T cells. Further, in the pTCR-positive DN3 cells, a threshold level of NFATc1 activity is vital in facilitating T-cell differentiation and to prevent Notch3-induced T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Altogether, our results show NFATc1 activity is crucial in determining the T-cell fate of thymocytes.","['Klein-Hessling, Stefan', 'Rudolf, Ronald', 'Muhammad, Khalid', 'Knobeloch, Klaus-Peter', 'Maqbool, Muhammad Ahmad', 'Cauchy, Pierre', 'Andrau, Jean-Christophe', 'Avots, Andris', 'Talora, Claudio', 'Ellenrieder, Volker', 'Screpanti, Isabella', 'Serfling, Edgar', 'Patra, Amiya Kumar']","['Klein-Hessling S', 'Rudolf R', 'Muhammad K', 'Knobeloch KP', 'Maqbool MA', 'Cauchy P', 'Andrau JC', 'Avots A', 'Talora C', 'Ellenrieder V', 'Screpanti I', 'Serfling E', 'Patra AK']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, Institute for Pathology, University of Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider Strasse 2, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Institute for Pathology, University of Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider Strasse 2, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Institute for Pathology, University of Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider Strasse 2, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Neuropathology, University Clinic Freiburg, Breisacher Strasse 64, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier (IGMM), UMR5535 CNRS, 1919 Route de Mende, 34293 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.', 'Institute of Biomedical Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.', 'Institute de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier (IGMM), UMR5535 CNRS, 1919 Route de Mende, 34293 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Institute for Pathology, University of Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider Strasse 2, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena 291, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Gastroenterology II, University of Goettingen, Robert Koch Strasse 40, 37075 Goettingen, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena 291, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Institute for Pathology, University of Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider Strasse 2, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Pathology, Institute for Pathology, University of Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider Strasse 2, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160617,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nfatc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Notch3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Survival', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/immunology', 'Lymphopenia/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/genetics/*immunology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/immunology', 'Receptor, Notch3/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Thymocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology']",,,2016/06/18 06:00,2018/08/23 06:00,['2016/06/18 06:00'],"['2016/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/23 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms11841 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms11841 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2016 Jun 17;7:11841. doi: 10.1038/ncomms11841.,10.1038/ncomms11841 [doi],,PMC4915031,,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7396-5629'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structural and biochemical analyses have uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying CRM1/NES interaction. CRM1 binds NESs through a hydrophobic cleft, whose open or closed conformation facilitates NES binding and release. Several cofactors allosterically modulate the conformation of the NES-binding cleft through intramolecular interactions involving an acidic loop and a C-terminal helix in CRM1. This current model of CRM1-mediated nuclear export has not yet been evaluated in a cellular setting. Here, we describe SRV100, a cellular reporter to interrogate CRM1 nuclear export activity. Using this novel tool, we provide evidence further validating the model of NES binding and release by CRM1. Furthermore, using both SRV100-based cellular assays and in vitro biochemical analyses, we investigate the functional consequences of a recurrent cancer-related mutation, which targets a residue near CRM1 NES-binding cleft. Our data indicate that this mutation does not necessarily abrogate the nuclear export activity of CRM1, but may increase its affinity for NES sequences bearing a more negatively charged C-terminal end.","['Garcia-Santisteban, Iraia', 'Arregi, Igor', 'Alonso-Marino, Marian', 'Urbaneja, Maria A', 'Garcia-Vallejo, Juan J', 'Banuelos, Sonia', 'Rodriguez, Jose A']","['Garcia-Santisteban I', 'Arregi I', 'Alonso-Marino M', 'Urbaneja MA', 'Garcia-Vallejo JJ', 'Banuelos S', 'Rodriguez JA']","['Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Division of Cell Biology I, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biofisika Institute (UPV/EHU, CSIC), University of the Basque Country, Leioa, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biofisika Institute (UPV/EHU, CSIC), University of the Basque Country, Leioa, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biofisika Institute (UPV/EHU, CSIC), University of the Basque Country, Leioa, Spain.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Immunology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biofisika Institute (UPV/EHU, CSIC), University of the Basque Country, Leioa, Spain. sonia.banuelos@ehu.es.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain. josean.rodriguez@ehu.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160616,Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,"['0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Export Signals)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', '*Genes, Reporter', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Export Signals', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/chemistry/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cellular assay', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*NES', '*Recurrent mutation', '*XPO1']",2016/06/18 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/06/18 06:00'],"['2016/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00018-016-2292-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00018-016-2292-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2016 Dec;73(24):4685-4699. doi: 10.1007/s00018-016-2292-0.

AAML0531 was a Children's Oncology Group randomized phase 3 clinical trial that included 1022 children with de novo AML. For this analysis, we focused on non-Down syndrome favorable and standard risk patients who completed at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy without recurrence or withdrawal during protocol therapy. Those receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first remission were excluded. Five hundred and sixty-nine patients were included; 274 (48.2%) were favorable risk. The median cumulative time with neutropenia between Induction II to completion of Intensification II was 96 (range 54-204) days. Number of sterile site infections did not influence the risk of relapse or overall survival. However, longer duration of neutropenia was associated with a lower risk of relapse (hazard ratio 0.81 per 20 days neutropenia, p = 0.007). Longer duration of neutropenia was associated with a reduced risk of relapse for children with favorable and standard risk AML. Toxicity may be influenced by pharmacogenomics suggesting that individualized chemotherapy dosing may be an effective strategy.","['Sung, Lillian', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Wang, Yi-Cheng', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Gamis, Alan S']","['Sung L', 'Aplenc R', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Wang YC', 'Meshinchi S', 'Gamis AS']","['The Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.', ""Division of Pediatric Oncology/Stem Cell Transplant, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA, USA."", 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA, USA."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA, USA."", 'Division of Oncology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', ""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, MO, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20160704,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*neutropenia', '*oncology', '*pediatric', '*relapse risk']",2016/06/18 06:00,2017/05/02 06:00,['2016/06/18 06:00'],"['2016/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.30236 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2016 Nov 1;139(9):1930-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30236.

Actually the Gal-1 expression profile in multiple myeloma (MM) patients and its pathophysiological role in MM-induced angiogenesis and tumoral growth are unknown. In this study, we found that Gal-1 expression by MM cells was upregulated in hypoxic conditions and that stable knockdown of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha significantly downregulated its expression. Therefore, we performed Gal-1 inhibition using lentivirus transfection of shRNA anti-Gal-1 in human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs), and showed that its suppression modified transcriptional profiles in both hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Interestingly, Gal-1 inhibition in MM cells downregulated proangiogenic genes, including MMP9 and CCL2, and upregulated the antiangiogenic ones SEMA3A and CXCL10. Consistently, Gal-1 suppression in MM cells significantly decreased their proangiogenic properties in vitro. This was confirmed in vivo, in two different mouse models injected with HMCLs transfected with anti-Gal-1 shRNA or the control vector. Gal-1 suppression in both models significantly reduced tumor burden and microvascular density as compared with the control mice. Moreover, Gal-1 suppression induced smaller lytic lesions on X-ray in the intratibial model. Overall, our data indicate that Gal-1 is a new potential therapeutic target in MM blocking angiogenesis.","['Storti, P', 'Marchica, V', 'Airoldi, I', 'Donofrio, G', 'Fiorini, E', 'Ferri, V', 'Guasco, D', 'Todoerti, K', 'Silbermann, R', 'Anderson, J L', 'Zhao, W', 'Agnelli, L', 'Bolzoni, M', 'Martella, E', 'Mancini, C', 'Campanini, N', 'Noonan, D M', 'Petronini, P G', 'Neri, A', 'Aversa, F', 'Roodman, G D', 'Giuliani, N']","['Storti P', 'Marchica V', 'Airoldi I', 'Donofrio G', 'Fiorini E', 'Ferri V', 'Guasco D', 'Todoerti K', 'Silbermann R', 'Anderson JL', 'Zhao W', 'Agnelli L', 'Bolzoni M', 'Martella E', 'Mancini C', 'Campanini N', 'Noonan DM', 'Petronini PG', 'Neri A', 'Aversa F', 'Roodman GD', 'Giuliani N']","['Myeloma Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Myeloma Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', ""'Laboratorio di Oncologia', Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy."", 'Department of Medical-Veterinary Science, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Myeloma Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Myeloma Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Life Sciences, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Myeloma Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS, Rionero in Vulture, Italy.', 'Hematology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Hematology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Hematology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Myeloma Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', ""Pathology, 'Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria', Parma, Italy."", ""Pathology, 'Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria', Parma, Italy."", ""Pathology, 'Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria', Parma, Italy."", 'Department of Biotechnology and Life Sciences, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', ""Pathology, 'Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria', Parma, Italy."", ""Hematology Unit, 'Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda', 'Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico', Milan, Italy."", 'Myeloma Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.', ""Hematology and BMT Center, CoreLab, 'Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria', Parma, Italy."", 'Hematology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Richard L.

However, this approach is associated with high toxicity and significant treatment-related morbidity and mortality; thus, it is suitable for only a minority of high-risk patients, given that most persons with CLL have comorbidities and are of advanced age. Until very recently, international guidelines recommended HSCT for physically fit patients who displayed poor-risk features or had only a short response to immunochemotherapy. In the wake of novel treatment approaches that offer high efficacy and highly durable responses with little toxicity, our approach to HSCT in CLL needs to be re-evaluated. While we wait for data on the long-term efficacy of novel therapies to inform the choice of HSCT or alternative treatment, strategies must be assessed individually for every patient, and treatment must be conducted in the setting of randomized clinical trials whenever possible.","['Schwarzbich, Mark-Alexander', 'McClanahan, Fabienne', 'Gribben, John']","['Schwarzbich MA', 'McClanahan F', 'Gribben J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*surgery', '*Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/methods/statistics & numerical data']",,,2016/06/18 06:00,2016/08/19 06:00,['2016/06/18 06:00'],"['2016/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['217481 [pii]'],ppublish,"Oncology (Williston Park). 2016 Jun;30(6):526-33, 540.",217481 [pii],['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['Oncology (Williston Park). 2016 Jun;30(6):539-40.

However, the precise mechanism of these bioactivities remains poorly understood. In this study, we found significant similarity between berberine and two epigenetic modulators (CG-1521 and TSA). Reverse-docking using berberine as a ligand identified lysine-N-methyltransferase as a putative target of berberine. These findings suggested the potential role of berberine in epigenetic modulation. The results of PCR array analysis of epigenetic chromatin modification enzymes supported our hypothesis. Furthermore, the analysis showed that enzymes involved in histone acetylation and methylation were predominantly affected by treatment with berberine. Up-regulation of histone acetyltransferase CREBBP and EP300, histone deacetylase SIRT3, histone demethylase KDM6A as well as histone methyltransferase SETD7, and down-regulation of histone acetyltransferase HDAC8, histone methyltransferase WHSC1I, WHSC1II and SMYD3, in addition to 38 genes from histone clusters 1-3 were observed in berberine-treated cells using real-time PCR. In parallel, western blotting analyses revealed that the expression of H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 proteins decreased with berberine treatment. These results were further confirmed in acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) cell lines HL-60/ADR and KG1-alpha. Taken together, this study suggests that berberine might modulate the expression of epigenetic regulators important for many downstream pathways, resulting in the variation of its bioactivities.","['Wang, Zhixiang', 'Liu, Yuan', 'Xue, Yong', 'Hu, Haiyan', 'Ye, Jieyu', 'Li, Xiaodong', 'Lu, Zhigang', 'Meng, Fanyi', 'Liang, Shuang']","['Wang Z', 'Liu Y', 'Xue Y', 'Hu H', 'Ye J', 'Li X', 'Lu Z', 'Meng F', 'Liang S']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Third Hospital of Nanchang City, Nanchang, China.', 'Jiangxi Science & Technology Research Center for Safety, Jiangxi, China.', ""Department of Oncology, 6th People's Hospital of Shanghai, Shanghai, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Blood Transfusion, Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.

Therefore, there is a need for the development of new treatment options. We investigated the growth-suppressive effects of withaferin A (WA), a natural plant steroidal lactone, on myelodysplasia and leukemia cell lines. WA exhibited growth-suppressive effects on the cell lines, MDS-L, HL-60, THP-1, Jurkat and Ramos, and induction of cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase at relatively low doses. Evaluation by annexin V/PI also confirmed the induction of partial apoptosis. Gene expression profiling and subsequent gene set enrichment analysis revealed increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1). HMOX1 is known to induce autophagy during anticancer chemotherapy and is considered to be involved in the treatment resistance. Our study indicated increased HMOX1 protein levels and simultaneous increases in the autophagy-related protein LC3A/B in MDS-L cells treated with WA, suggesting increased autophagy. Combined use of WA with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, enhanced early apoptosis and growth suppression. Together with the knowledge that WA had no apparent suppressive effect on the growth of human normal bone marrow CD34-positive cells in the short-term culture, this drug may have a potential for a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of leukemia or MDS.","['Okamoto, Shuichiro', 'Tsujioka, Takayuki', 'Suemori, Shin-Ichiro', 'Kida, Jun-Ichiro', 'Kondo, Toshinori', 'Tohyama, Yumi', 'Tohyama, Kaoru']","['Okamoto S', 'Tsujioka T', 'Suemori S', 'Kida J', 'Kondo T', 'Tohyama Y', 'Tohyama K']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan.', 'Division of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Himeji Dokkyo University, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan. ktohyama@med.kawasaki-m.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160728,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Withanolides)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'L6DO3QW4K5 (withaferin A)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism', 'Withanolides/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'gene set enrichment analysis', 'heme oxygenase-1', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'withaferin A']",2016/06/18 06:00,2017/02/07 06:00,['2016/06/18 06:00'],"['2016/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12988 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2016 Sep;107(9):1302-14. doi: 10.1111/cas.12988.

Usually indolent and self-limited in childhood, the disease can exhibit aggressive progression in mid-adulthood. Our objectives were to describe the characteristics of the disease when diagnosed among elderly patients, for which rare data are available.The French Reference Center conducted a retrospective multicenter study on 53 patients with mastocytosis >69 years of age, to describe their clinical, biological, and genetic features.The median age of our cohort of patients was 75 years. Mastocytosis variants included were cutaneous (n = 1), indolent systemic (n = 5), aggressive systemic (n = 11), associated with a hematological non-mast cell disease (n = 34), and mast cell leukemia (n = 2). Clinical manifestations were predominantly mast cell activation symptoms (75.5%), poor performance status (50.9%), hepatosplenomegaly (50.9%), skin involvement (49.1%), osteoporosis (47.2%), and portal hypertension and ascites (26.4%). The main biological features were anemia (79.2%), thrombocytopenia (50.9%), leucopenia (20.8%), and liver enzyme abnormalities (32.1%). Of the 40 patients tested, 34 (85%), 2 (5%), and 4 (10%) exhibited the KIT D816V mutant, other KIT mutations and the wild-type form of the KIT gene, respectively. Additional sequencing detected significant genetic defects in 17 of 26 (65.3%) of the patients with associated hematological non-mast cell disease, including TET2, SRSF2, IDH2, and ASLX1 mutations. Death occurred in 19 (35.8%) patients, within a median delay of 9 months, despite the different treatment options available.Mastocytosis among elderly patients has a challenging early detection, rare skin involvement, and/or limited skin disease; it is heterogeneous and has often an aggressive presentation with nonfortuitous associated myeloid lineage malignant clones, and thus a poor overall prognosis.","['Rouet, Audrey', 'Aouba, Achille', 'Damaj, Gandhi', 'Soucie, Erinn', 'Hanssens, Katia', 'Chandesris, Marie-Olivia', 'Livideanu, Cristina Bulai', 'Dutertre, Marine', 'Durieu, Isabelle', 'Grandpeix-Guyodo, Catherine', 'Barete, Stephane', 'Bachmeyer, Claude', 'Soria, Angele', 'Frenzel, Laurent', 'Fain, Olivier', 'Grosbois, Bernard', 'de Gennes, Christian', 'Hamidou, Mohamed', 'Arlet, Jean-Benoit', 'Launay, David', 'Lavigne, Christian', 'Arock, Michel', 'Lortholary, Olivier', 'Dubreuil, Patrice', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Georgin-Lavialle, Sophie']","['Rouet A', 'Aouba A', 'Damaj G', 'Soucie E', 'Hanssens K', 'Chandesris MO', 'Livideanu CB', 'Dutertre M', 'Durieu I', 'Grandpeix-Guyodo C', 'Barete S', 'Bachmeyer C', 'Soria A', 'Frenzel L', 'Fain O', 'Grosbois B', 'de Gennes C', 'Hamidou M', 'Arlet JB', 'Launay D', 'Lavigne C', 'Arock M', 'Lortholary O', 'Dubreuil P', 'Hermine O', 'Georgin-Lavialle S']","[""Service de medecine interne, Hopital Tenon, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France Service de Medecine Interne, CHU de Caen, Universite Basse Normandie, Caen, France Institut d'Hematologie de Basse Normandie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Universite de Caen-Basse Normandie, Caen, France Faculte de Medecine et AP-HP Necker-Enfants Malades, Centre de Reference des Mastocytoses, Paris Cedex 15, France Inserm, U1068, CRCM [Signaling, Hematopoiesis and Mechanism of Oncogenesis], Institut Paoli-Calmettes,Marseille, Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, UMR7258, Marseille, France Mastocytosis Competence Center of Midi-Pyrenees, Department of Dermatology, Toulouse University Hospital, Toulouse, France Service de Medecine Interne, Universite Claude Bernard Lyon1, Groupe Hospitalier Lyon-Sud.

The patient was referred from the Department of Hematology for a biopsy of the lesion. Full-thickness flaps were elevated and inflamed, and neoplastic soft tissue was removed from a lesion and the samples sent for histopathologic analysis.Histopathologic results showed leukemic cell infiltration beneath the oral epithelium, and the specimen was positive for the leukocyte marker. The diagnosis was myeloid sarcoma. Uneventful healing was observed at 2-week follow-up, but relapse of the lesions with the hyperplastic and neoplastic tissue was noted at 4-week follow-up. Further follow-up or treatment could not be performed because the patient did not visit at the next follow-up.In conclusion, myeloid sarcoma should be a diagnosis option for gingival growth because it can involve intraoral lesion.

Cell adhesion is a physiologically relevant stimulus previously shown to increase calreticulin interaction with alpha-integrins via the juxtamembrane, cytosolic GFFKR motif. This study assessed whether integrin function can regulate surface calreticulin levels in ICD. We generated calreticulin-null T-lymphoblasts and confirmed the loss of surface calreticulin expression on cells treated with doxorubicin, an ICD inducer. Reconstituted expression with full-length calreticulin targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) successfully rescued doxorubicin-induced surface calreticulin. Reconstitution with a truncation mutant calreticulin targeted to the cytosol led to constitutively high surface calreticulin that was not further elevated by doxorubicin, suggesting calreticulin released from the stressed ER transits the cytosol before its translocation to the cell surface. When stimulated to engage integrin substrates, doxorubicin-treated wild-type T-lymphoblasts exhibited decreased surface calreticulin compared with cells under non-adherent conditions. The inhibitory effect on surface calreticulin was recapitulated for cells in suspension treated with a beta1-integrin-activating antibody, 9EG7. Similarly, cells expressing a truncated alpha-integrin cytosolic tail, bearing only the juxtamembrane GFFKR calreticulin-binding motif, exhibited low surface calreticulin with doxorubicin treatment under non-adherent conditions. Using partial permeabilization techniques to distinguish between cytosolic and ER staining, we found that ICD inducers promoted the accumulation of cytosolic calreticulin with negligible change in total calreticulin, suggesting that integrin-mediated inhibition of surface calreticulin was due to reduced cytosolic to surface translocation. T-lymphoblasts co-treated with an ICD inducer and 9EG7 exhibited reduced phagocytosis by macrophages when compared with treatment with only ICD inducer. This study reveals a previously uncharacterized function of integrins as negative regulators of ICD by suppressing presentation of cell surface calreticulin.","['Liu, C-C', 'Leclair, P', 'Monajemi, M', 'Sly, L M', 'Reid, G S', 'Lim, C J']","['Liu CC', 'Leclair P', 'Monajemi M', 'Sly LM', 'Reid GS', 'Lim CJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5Z 4H4.', 'Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5Z 4H4.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5Z 4H4.', 'Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5Z 4H4.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5Z 4H4.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5Z 4H4.', ""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5Z 4H4."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5Z 4H4.', ""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5Z 4H4.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160616,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Integrin alpha3)', '0 (Integrin alpha5)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Calreticulin/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha3/*genetics/immunology', 'Integrin alpha4/*genetics/immunology', 'Integrin alpha5/*genetics/immunology', 'Integrin beta1/genetics/immunology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Macrophages/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Transport', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/pathology']",,,2016/06/17 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2016/06/17 06:00'],"['2016/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2016176 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.176 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Jun 16;7:e2268. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.176.,10.1038/cddis.2016.176 [doi],['MOP-137033/CIHR/Canada'],PMC5143402,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although all pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins are known to bind/neutralize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, the three most potent ones, Bid (tBid), Bim, and Puma, possess an additional activity of directly activating Bax/Bak in vitro. This latter activity has been proposed to be responsible for triggering Bax/Bak activation following apoptotic stimulation. To test this hypothesis, we generated Bid(-/)(-)Bim(-/)(-)Puma(-/)(-) (TKO), TKO/Bax(-/)(-)/Bak(-/)(-) (PentaKO), and PentaKO/Mcl-1(-/-) (HexaKO) HCT116 cells through gene editing. Surprisingly, although the TKO cells were resistant to several apoptotic stimuli, robust apoptosis was induced upon the simultaneous inactivation of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, two anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins known to suppress Bax/Bak activation and activity. Importantly, such apoptotic activity was completely abolished in the PentaKO cells. In addition, ABT-737, a BH3 mimetic that inhibits Bcl-xL/Bcl-w/Bcl-2, induced Bax activation in HexaKO cells reconstituted with endogenous level of GFP-Bax. Further, by generating TKO/p53(-/-) (QKO) cells, we demonstrated that p53, a tumor suppressor postulated to directly activate Bax, is not required for Bid/Bim/Puma-independent Bax/Bak activation. Together, these results strongly suggest that the direct activation activities of Bid (tBid), Bim, Puma, and p53 are not essential for activating Bax/Bak once the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are neutralized.","['Zhang, J', 'Huang, K', ""O'Neill, K L"", 'Pang, X', 'Luo, X']","['Zhang J', 'Huang K', ""O'Neill KL"", 'Pang X', 'Luo X']","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-7696, USA.', 'Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-7696, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-7696, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-7696, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-7696, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160616,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/deficiency/*genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/deficiency/*genetics', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/*genetics', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/06/17 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2016/06/17 06:00'],"['2016/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2016167 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.167 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Jun 16;7:e2266. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.167.,10.1038/cddis.2016.167 [doi],['P30 GM106397/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5143395,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ENL (MLLT1) and AF9 (MLLT3) are fusion partners of Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL), TrxG proteins, and are factors in Super Elongation Complex (SEC). SEC controls transcriptional elongation to release RNA polymerase II, paused around transcription start site. In MLL rearranged leukemia, several components of SEC have been found as MLL-fusion partners and the control of transcriptional elongation is misregulated leading to tumorigenesis in MLL-SEC fused Leukemia. It has been suggested that unexpected collaboration of ENL/AF9-MLL and PcG are involved in tumorigenesis in leukemia. Recently, we found that the collaboration of ENL/AF9 and PcG led to a novel mechanism of transcriptional switch from elongation to repression under ATM-signaling for genome integrity. Activated ATM phosphorylates ENL/AF9 in SEC, and the phosphorylated ENL/AF9 binds BMI1 and RING1B, a heterodimeric E3-ubiquitin-ligase complex in Polycomb Repressive complex 1 (PRC1), and recruits PRC1 at transcriptional elongation sites to rapidly repress transcription. The ENL/AF9 in SEC- and PcG-mediated transcriptional repression promotes DSB repair near transcription sites. The implication of this is that the collaboration of ENL/AF9 in SEC and PcG ensures a rapid response of transcriptional switching from elongation to repression to neighboring genotoxic stresses for DSB repair. Therefore, these results suggested that the collaboration of ENL/AF9 and PcG in transcriptional control is required to maintain genome integrity and may be link to the MLL-ENL/AF9 leukemia.","['Ui, Ayako', 'Yasui, Akira']","['Ui A', 'Yasui A']","['a Department of Translational Oncology , St. Marianna University , School of Medicine , Miyamae-Ku , Kawasaki , Japan.', 'b Division of Dynamic Proteome in Cancer and Aging , Institute of Development , Aging and Cancer , Tohoku University , Aoba-ku , Sendai , Japan.', 'b Division of Dynamic Proteome in Cancer and Aging , Institute of Development , Aging and Cancer , Tohoku University , Aoba-ku , Sendai , Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Nucleus,"Nucleus (Austin, Tex.)",101518322,"['0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Genome/*genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ATM', '*DSB repair', '*DSB-induced transcriptional repression', '*Polycomb', '*SEC']",2016/06/17 06:00,2017/05/13 06:00,['2016/06/17 06:00'],"['2016/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/19491034.2016.1177681 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleus. 2016 Apr 25;7(2):138-45. doi: 10.1080/19491034.2016.1177681.,10.1080/19491034.2016.1177681 [doi],,PMC4916901,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As there are limited data on HDACIs effects, we aimed to dissect VPA effects in vitro using myeloid cell lines with the idea to integrate findings with in vivo data from AML patients treated with VPA additionally to intensive chemotherapy (n = 12). By gene expression profiling we identified an in vitro VPA response signature enriched for genes/pathways known to be implicated in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Following VPA treatment in vivo, gene expression changes in AML patients showed concordant results with the in vitro VPA response despite concomitant intensive chemotherapy. Comparative miRNA profiling revealed VPA-associated miRNA expression changes likely contributing to a VPA-induced reversion of deregulated gene expression. In addition, we were able to define markers predicting VPA response in vivo such as CXCR4 and LBH. These could be validated in an independent cohort of VPA and intensive chemotherapy treated AML patients (n = 114) in which they were inversely correlated with relapse-free survival. In summary, our data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of VPA in myeloid blasts, which might be useful in further advancing HDAC inhibition based treatment approaches in AML.","['Rucker, Frank G', 'Lang, Katharina M', 'Futterer, Markus', 'Komarica, Vladimir', 'Schmid, Mathias', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Knudsen, Steen', 'Bullinger, Lars']","['Rucker FG', 'Lang KM', 'Futterer M', 'Komarica V', 'Schmid M', 'Dohner H', 'Schlenk RF', 'Dohner K', 'Knudsen S', 'Bullinger L']","['a Department of Internal Medicine III , University Hospital of Ulm , Ulm , Germany.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine III , University Hospital of Ulm , Ulm , Germany.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine III , University Hospital of Ulm , Ulm , Germany.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine III , University Hospital of Ulm , Ulm , Germany.', 'b Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology , Triemli Hospital , Zurich , Switzerland.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine III , University Hospital of Ulm , Ulm , Germany.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine III , University Hospital of Ulm , Ulm , Germany.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine III , University Hospital of Ulm , Ulm , Germany.', 'c Medical Prognosis Institute (MPI) , Horsholm , Denmark.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine III , University Hospital of Ulm , Ulm , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20160616,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (LBH protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptome', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*gene expression', '*histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACI)', '*miRNA expression', '*prognostic marker', '*valproic acid (VPA)']",2016/06/17 06:00,2017/06/01 06:00,['2016/06/17 06:00'],"['2016/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15592294.2016.1187350 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2016 Jul 2;11(7):517-25. doi: 10.1080/15592294.2016.1187350.

Development of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents is a major hurdle in the effective treatment of patients with AML. The quinazolinone derivative erastin was originally identified in a screen for small molecules that exhibit synthetic lethality with expression of the RAS oncogene. This lethality was subsequently shown to occur by induction of a novel form of cell death termed ferroptosis. In this study we demonstrate that erastin enhances the sensitivity of AML cells to chemotherapeutic agents in an RAS-independent manner. Erastin dose-dependently induced mixed types of cell death associated with ferroptosis, apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy in HL-60 cells (AML, NRAS_Q61L), but not Jurkat (acute T-cell leukemia, RAS wild type), THP-1 (AML, NRAS_G12D), K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia, RAS wild type), or NB-4 (acute promyelocytic leukemia M3, KRAS_A18D) cells. Treatment with ferrostatin-1 (a potent ferroptosis inhibitor) or necrostatin-1 (a potent necroptosis inhibitor), but not with Z-VAD-FMK (a general caspase inhibitor) or chloroquine (a potent autophagy inhibitor), prevented erastin-induced growth inhibition in HL-60 cells. Moreover, inhibition of c-JUN N-terminal kinase and p38, but not of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation, induced resistance to erastin in HL-60 cells. Importantly, low-dose erastin significantly enhanced the anticancer activity of 2 first-line chemotherapeutic drugs (cytarabine/ara-C and doxorubicin/adriamycin) in HL-60 cells. Collectively, the induction of ferroptosis and necroptosis contributed to erastin-induced growth inhibition and overcame drug resistance in AML cells.","['Yu, Yan', 'Xie, Yangchun', 'Cao, Lizhi', 'Yang, Liangchun', 'Yang, Minghua', 'Lotze, Michael T', 'Zeh, Herbert J', 'Kang, Rui', 'Tang, Daolin']","['Yu Y', 'Xie Y', 'Cao L', 'Yang L', 'Yang M', 'Lotze MT', 'Zeh HJ', 'Kang R', 'Tang D']","['Center for DAMP Biology; Department of Surgery; University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute; University of Pittsburgh; Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Department of Pediatrics; Xiangya Hospital; Central South University; Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Center for DAMP Biology; Department of Surgery; University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute; University of Pittsburgh ; Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics; Xiangya Hospital; Central South University ; Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics; Xiangya Hospital; Central South University ; Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics; Xiangya Hospital; Central South University ; Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Center for DAMP Biology; Department of Surgery; University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute; University of Pittsburgh ; Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Center for DAMP Biology; Department of Surgery; University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute; University of Pittsburgh ; Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Center for DAMP Biology; Department of Surgery; University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute; University of Pittsburgh ; Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Center for DAMP Biology; Department of Surgery; University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute; University of Pittsburgh ; Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150526,United States,Mol Cell Oncol,Molecular & cellular oncology,101642411,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'autophagy', 'erastin', 'ferroptosis', 'necroptosis']",2016/06/17 06:00,2016/06/17 06:01,['2016/06/17 06:00'],"['2015/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2015/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/23723556.2015.1054549 [doi]', '1054549 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cell Oncol. 2015 May 26;2(4):e1054549. doi: 10.1080/23723556.2015.1054549. eCollection 2015 Oct-Dec.,10.1080/23723556.2015.1054549 [doi],,PMC4905356,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon recognizing viral RNA ligands, RIG-I experiences a series of programmed conformational changes and modifications that unleash its activity through the formation of complexes with various binding partners. Such partners include the mitochondria membrane-anchored protein IPS-1 (also named MAVS/VISA/Cardif) that activates both the IRF3/7 and NF-kappaB pathways. These partnerships and resulting pathway activations underlie the synthesis of type I interferon and other inflammatory factors. Recent studies have demonstrated that RIG-I is also involved in the regulation of basic cellular processes outside of innate immunity against viral infections, such as hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation, maintenance of leukemic stemness, and tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Epigenetically uncurbed ZNF423 interferes with lymphopoiesis by sequestration of the essential early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) causing B-cell maturation arrest, a hallmark of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Conversely, its presence in neuroblastoma, a primitive neuroectodermal tumor of childhood, allows retinoic acid-induced differentiation and is associated with a favorable outcome of neuroblastoma patients. Such opposing effects may be explained by the cellular context, but also by the multifunctionality of ZNF423 that is mediated by 30 zinc fingers forming various functional domains.

Most patients are maintained in a disease-suppressed state on daily TKI therapy for several years and in many cases this treatment prevents progression to the blast phase. If the TKI is discontinued, CML redevelops in 95% of patients as a result of persisting leukemia initiating cells (LICs). There are several hypotheses that describe the potential mechanism(s) responsible for LIC persistence in CML, but supporting evidence is limited. Furthermore, of the few patients who discontinue TKI therapy and are ""cured"" (i.e., in treatment-free remission), most have residual BCR/ABL-expressing cells in their hematopoietic tissues. There are also healthy individuals without a CML diagnosis who express the BCR/ABL mutation in a fraction of their hematopoietic cells. Finally, mice that express BCR/ABL from the Bcr locus as a knockin mutation do not develop CML. These mice have lower BCR/ABL levels than retroviral or transgenic models of BCR/ABL that do develop CML.

The most common cause of papilledema is increased intracranial pressure due to brain tumor. Also it may occur as a result of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH, pseudo tumor cerebri). Moreover, papilledema may also develop due to retinitis, vasculitis, Graves' disease, hypertension, leukemia, lymphoma, diabetes mellitus and radiation. CASE REPORT: In this article, a patient who developed papilledema while under treatment with mirtazapine (30 mg/day) for two years and recovered with termination of mirtazapine treatment was discussed to draw the attention of clinicians to this side effect of mirtazapine. CONCLUSION: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension and papilledema due to psychotropic drugs has been reported in the literature. Mirtazapine may rarely cause peripheral edema. However, papilledema due to mirtazapine has not been previously reported. Although papilledema is a very rare side effect of an antidepressant treatment, fundoscopic examinations of patients must be performed regularly.","['Ceylan, Mehmet Emin', 'Evrensel, Alper', 'Comert, Gokce']","['Ceylan ME', 'Evrensel A', 'Comert G']","['Department of Psychology, Uskudar University School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Psychology, Uskudar University School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Psychology, Uskudar University School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160501,Turkey,Balkan Med J,Balkan medical journal,101571817,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antidepressant', 'mirtazapine', 'papilledema', 'side effect']",2016/06/17 06:00,2016/06/17 06:01,['2016/06/17 06:00'],"['2015/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5152/balkanmedj.2016.150151 [doi]', 'bmj-33-3-363 [pii]']",ppublish,Balkan Med J. 2016 May;33(3):363-5. doi: 10.5152/balkanmedj.2016.150151.

Based on the above findings, DNA hypomethylating agents (HMA) have been widely used to treat AML and MDS, especially in elderly patients and in those who are not eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Our goal was to determine if there is any therapeutic advantage of HMA vs. conventional care regimens (CCR) and indirectly compare the efficacy of azacitidine and decitabine in this patient population. METHODS: Eligible studies were limited to randomized controlled trials comparing HMA to CCR in adult patients with AML or MDS. RESULTS: Overall survival (OS) rate was 33.2 vs. 21.4 % (RR 0.83, 95 % CI 0.71-0.98) and overall response rate (ORR) 23.7 vs. 13.4 % (RR 0.87, 95 % CI 0.81-0.93) for HMA and CCR, respectively. In subgroup analyses, only azacitidine treatment showed OS improvement (RR 0.75, 95 % CI 0.64-0.98) and not decitabine. Cytogenetic risk or bone marrow blast count did not have independent prognostic impact. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results demonstrate that HMA have superior outcomes compared to CCR and suggest that azacitidine in comparison to decitabine, may be more effective.","['Yun, Seongseok', 'Vincelette, Nicole D', 'Abraham, Ivo', 'Robertson, Keith D', 'Fernandez-Zapico, Martin E', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M']","['Yun S', 'Vincelette ND', 'Abraham I', 'Robertson KD', 'Fernandez-Zapico ME', 'Patnaik MM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Arizona, 1501 N.

Even though thrombocytosis is benign and self-limiting in most cases, it can at times result in thrombosis or hemorrhage. The most common type of thrombocytosis is reactive (secondary) thrombocytosis and can be due to infections, trauma, surgery, or occult malignancy. Since thrombocytosis is a known risk factor for thrombosis, it is commonly a concern for ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction. Much less common are hemorrhagic events associated with thrombocytosis. Studies have shown that when hemorrhage is present in patients with thrombocytosis, it is most often seen in the setting of chronic myelogenous leukemia and essential thrombocythemia. In essential thrombocythemia, the overall risk of bleeding and thrombosis is 0.33% per patient-year and 6.6% per patient-year, respectively. In the general population, the risk of bleeding and thrombosis is 0% and 1.2%, respectively. The present study is a case report of an 83-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with hypertension and headache, who was then found to have significant thrombocytosis (platelets >1,000x10(9)/L) and acute right intraventricular hemorrhage without any signs of neurological deficits, or evidence of vascular malformations or mass.

We set out to develop and test (preclinically) a Vdelta1(+) T-cell-based protocol that is good manufacturing practice compatible and devoid of feeder cells for prompt clinical translation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We tested multiple combinations of clinical-grade agonist antibodies and cytokines for their capacity to expand and differentiate (more than 2-3 weeks) Vdelta1(+) T cells from the peripheral blood of healthy donors and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We characterized the phenotype and functional potential of the final cellular product, termed Delta One T (DOT) cells, in vitro and in vivo (xenograft models of CLL). RESULTS: We describe a very robust two-step protocol for the selective expansion (up to 2,000-fold in large clinical-grade cell culture bags) and differentiation of cytotoxic Vdelta1(+) (DOT) cells. These expressed the natural cytotoxicity receptors, NKp30 and NKp44, which synergized with the T-cell receptor to mediate leukemia cell targeting in vitro When transferred in vivo, DOT cells infiltrated tumors and peripheral organs, and persisted until the end of the analysis without showing signs of loss of function; indeed, DOT cells proliferated and produced abundant IFNgamma and TNFalpha, but importantly no IL17, in vivo Critically, DOT cells were capable of inhibiting tumor growth and preventing dissemination in xenograft models of CLL. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a clinical-grade method and the preclinical proof of principle for application of a new cellular product, DOT cells, in adoptive immunotherapy of CLL.

The genetic alterations in infected cells that lead to transformation have not been completely elucidated, thus hindering the identification of effective therapeutic targets for ATL. Here, we present the first assessment of MYB proto-oncogene dysregulation in ATL and an exploration of its role in the onset of ATL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the expression patterns of MYB splicing variants in ATL. The molecular characteristics of the c-Myb-9A isoform, which was overexpressed in ATL cells, were examined using chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter assays. We further examined the biologic impacts of abnormal c-Myb overexpression in ATL using overall c-Myb knockdown with shRNA or c-Myb-9A knockdown with morpholino oligomers. RESULTS: Both total c-Myb and c-Myb-9A, which exhibited strong transforming activity, were overexpressed in ATL cells in a leukemogenesis- and progression-dependent manner. Knockdown of either total c-Myb or c-Myb-9A induced ATL cell death. c-Myb transactivates nine genes that encode essential regulators of cell proliferation and NF-kappaB signaling. c-Myb-9A induced significantly stronger transactivation of all tested genes and stronger NF-kappaB activation compared with wild-type c-Myb. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that c-Myb pathway overactivation caused by unbalanced c-Myb-9A overexpression is associated with disorders in cellular homeostasis and consequently, accelerated transformation, cell proliferation, and malignancy in ATL cells. These data support the notion of the c-Myb pathway as a promising new therapeutic target for ATL. Clin Cancer Res; 22(23); 5915-28.

On the basis of data showing KIR-ligand mismatched natural killer (NK) cells reduce the risk of leukemia and multiple myeloma relapse following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, investigators have developed a checkpoint inhibition antibody that blocks KIR on NK cells. Although in vitro studies suggest the KIR2D-specific antibody IPH2101 induces KIR-ligand mismatched tumor killing by NK cells, our single-arm phase II clinical trial in patients with smoldering multiple myeloma was prematurely terminated due to lack of clinical efficacy. This study aimed at unveiling the underlying mechanisms behind the lack of clinical efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Treatment-naive patients received an intravenous infusion of 1 mg/kg IPH2101 every other month for up to a year. Peripheral blood was collected at baseline and 24 hours after first infusion, followed by weekly samples for the first month and monthly samples thereafter. NK cell phenotype and function was analyzed using high-resolution flow cytometry. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, infusion of IPH2101 resulted in rapid reduction in both NK cell responsiveness and KIR2D expression on the NK cell surface. In vitro assays revealed KIR2D molecules are removed from the surface of IPH2101-treated NK cells by trogocytosis, with reductions in NK cell function directly correlating with loss of free KIR2D surface molecules. Although IPH2101 marginally augmented the antimyeloma cytotoxicity of remaining KIR2D(dull) patient NK cells, the overall response was diminished by significant contraction and reduced function of KIR2D-expressing NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data raise concerns that the unexpected biological events reported in this study could compromise antibody-based strategies designed at augmenting NK cell tumor killing via checkpoint inhibition.

It is responsible for more than one third of thyroid cancer-related deaths. ATC is frequently resistant to conventional therapy, and NFkappaB signaling has been proposed to be a feature of the disease. We aimed to assess the activity of the antimalaria drug quinacrine known to target NFkappaB signaling in combination with the clinically relevant kinase inhibitor sorafenib in ATC cells. The presence of NFkappaB-p65/RELA and its target MCL1 was demonstrated in ATC by meta-data gene set enrichment analysis and IHC. We assessed the responses of a panel of human ATC cell lines to quinacrine and sorafenib in vitro and in vivo RESULTS: We detected increased expression of NFkappaB-p65/RELA and MCL1 in the nucleus of a subset of ATC compared with non-neoplastic thyroid. ATC cells were found to respond with additive/synergistic tumor cell killing to the combination of sorafenib plus quinacrine in vitro, and the drug combination improves survival of immunodeficient mice injected orthotopically with ATC cells as compared with mice administered either compound alone or doxorubicin. We also demonstrate that the combination of sorafenib and quinacrine is well tolerated in mice. At the molecular level, quinacrine and sorafenib inhibited expression of prosurvival MCL1, pSTAT3, and dampened NFkappaB signaling.

It is assumed that this assay can be applied as a diagnostic method in the detection of chromosomal translocation which commonly occurs in hematologic malignancies. METHODS: KCL-22 cell line and white blood cells from 21 CML patients were recruited in the study. Cells were isolated and fixed. After permeabilization, cells were resuspended in hybridization buffer and probes were added to the mixture. Subsequently, cells were washed and analyzed on the flow cytometer instrument. The flow cytometry results were compared with qRT-PCR and fluorescent microscope outcomes. RESULTS: Using the current principle, 97 +/- 2.1% of the KCL-22 cells were labeled with b2a2 mRNA-specific probes. In addition, seven patients were recognized positive for t(9;22) b2a2. The percentage of cells containing abovementioned translocation in these patients was varied from 3.26% to 97.8%. There was no false-positive result in negative controls (K562 with BCR-ABL1 b3a2, NB4, and Jurkat cell lines) along with blood samples of normal controls. All the results obtained by flow-FISH were confirmed by qRT-PCR and fluorescent microscope. CONCLUSION: This strategy benefits from appropriate specificity, sensitivity, rapidity, and ability in the determination of malignant cell percentage. Therefore, it can improve traditional time-consuming and labor-intensive FISH method.","['Ranjbaran, R', 'Okhovat, M A', 'Abbasi, M', 'Moezzi, L', 'Aboualizadeh, F', 'Amidzadeh, Z', 'Golafshan, H A', 'Behzad-Behbahani, A', 'Sharifzadeh, S']","['Ranjbaran R', 'Okhovat MA', 'Abbasi M', 'Moezzi L', 'Aboualizadeh F', 'Amidzadeh Z', 'Golafshan HA', 'Behzad-Behbahani A', 'Sharifzadeh S']","['Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160616,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/chemistry/*pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Translocation, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'CML', 'FRET probe', 'flow-FISH']",2016/06/17 06:00,2017/03/03 06:00,['2016/06/17 06:00'],"['2015/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12515 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2016 Aug;38(4):403-11. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12515.

Lyme disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and leukemia are several examples. In this article, the authors describe the cause, the initial diagnostic approach, and the management of long-term sequelae of bilateral paralysis that has evolved in the authors' center over the past 13 years. METHODS: A chart review was performed to identify all patients diagnosed with bilateral paralysis at the authors' center between January of 2002 and January of 2015. Demographics, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, initial medical treatment, interventions for facial reanimation, and outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 2471 patients seen at the authors' center, 68 patients (3 percent) with bilateral facial paralysis were identified. Ten patients (15 percent) presented with bilateral facial paralysis caused by Lyme disease, nine (13 percent) with Mobius syndrome, nine (13 percent) with neurofibromatosis type 2, five (7 percent) with bilateral facial palsy caused by brain tumor, four (6 percent) with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome, three (4 percent) with bilateral temporal bone fractures, two (3 percent) with Guillain-Barre syndrome, one (2 percent) with central nervous system lymphoma, one (2 percent) with human immunodeficiency virus infection, and 24 (35 percent) with presumed Bell palsy. Treatment included pharmacologic therapy, physical therapy, chemodenervation, and surgical interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral facial palsy is a rare medical condition, and treatment often requires a multidisciplinary approach. The authors outline diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms of a tertiary care center to provide clinicians with a systematic approach to managing these complicated patients.","['Gaudin, Robert A', 'Jowett, Nathan', 'Banks, Caroline A', 'Knox, Christopher J', 'Hadlock, Tessa A']","['Gaudin RA', 'Jowett N', 'Banks CA', 'Knox CJ', 'Hadlock TA']","['Boston, Mass.', 'From the Department of Otolaryngology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Harvard Medical School.', 'Boston, Mass.', 'From the Department of Otolaryngology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Harvard Medical School.', 'Boston, Mass.', 'From the Department of Otolaryngology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Harvard Medical School.', 'Boston, Mass.', 'From the Department of Otolaryngology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Harvard Medical School.', 'Boston, Mass.', 'From the Department of Otolaryngology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Harvard Medical School.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Plast Reconstr Surg,Plastic and reconstructive surgery,1306050,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Facial Paralysis/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/06/17 06:00,2017/05/05 06:00,['2016/06/17 06:00'],"['2016/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/PRS.0000000000002599 [doi]', '00006534-201610000-00029 [pii]']",ppublish,Plast Reconstr Surg. 2016 Oct;138(4):879-887. doi: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000002599.,10.1097/PRS.0000000000002599 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibiting Mnk1/2-induced phosphorylation of eIF4E may represent a unique approach for the treatment of AML. We provide evidence for antileukemic effects of merestinib, an orally bioavailable multikinase inhibitor with suppressive effects on Mnk activity. Our studies show that merestinib effectively blocks eIF4E phosphorylation in AML cells and suppresses primitive leukemic progenitors from AML patients in vitro and in an AML xenograft model in vivo.

Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) have been shown to be effective to eliminate MRD. In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of anti-CD10 MAb conjugated to muramyl dipeptide immunoconjugate (MDP-Ab) on the function of lymphocytes and activated lymphocytes using leukemia xenografts in nude mice as a model. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and induced into dendritic cells (DCs) and lymphocytes. Cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes was detected by LDH release assay. Leukemia xenografts in nude mice were established to assess tumor growth. We found that the killing rate was significantly higher in MDP-Ab group, LPS group and MDP-Ab+LPS group than in control group, and was the highest in MDP-Ab+LPS group. Tumor-bearing mice in MDP-Ab group showed obvious coagulation necrosis. In conclusion, our data suggest that MDP-Ab could effectively prime DCs to improve the anti-tumor immunity of T lymphocytes and inhibit the tumor growth.

GPSM3 deficiency protects mice from inflammatory arthritis and, in humans, GPSM3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are inversely associated with the risk of rheumatoid arthritis development; recently, these polymorphisms were linked to one particular SNP (rs204989) that decreases GPSM3 transcript abundance. However, the precise role of GPSM3 in leukocyte biology is unknown. Here, we show that GPSM3 is induced in the human promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cell line following retinoic acid treatment, which differentiates this cell line into a model of neutrophil physiology (NB4*). Reducing GPSM3 expression in NB4* cells, akin to the effect ascribed to the rs204989 C>T transition, disrupts cellular migration toward leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and (to a lesser extent) interleukin-8 (a.k.a. IL-8 or CXCL8), but not migration toward formylated peptides (fMLP). As the chemoattractants LTB4 and CXCL8 are involved in recruitment of neutrophils to the arthritic joint, our results suggest that the arthritis-protective GPSM3 SNP rs204989 may act to decrease neutrophil chemoattractant responsiveness.","['Gall, B J', 'Schroer, A B', 'Gross, J D', 'Setola, V', 'Siderovski, D P']","['Gall BJ', 'Schroer AB', 'Gross JD', 'Setola V', 'Siderovski DP']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, WV, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, WV, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, WV, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, WV, USA.', 'Department of Behavioral Medicine and Psychiatry, West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, WV, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, West Virginia University School of Medicine, Morgantown, WV, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160616,England,Genes Immun,Genes and immunity,100953417,"['0 (GPSM3 protein, human)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)']",IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/genetics', 'Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Leukopoiesis', 'Leukotriene B4/metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Tretinoin/metabolism']",,,2016/06/17 06:00,2017/05/19 06:00,['2016/06/17 06:00'],"['2016/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['gene201626 [pii]', '10.1038/gene.2016.26 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Immun. 2016 Sep;17(6):321-7. doi: 10.1038/gene.2016.26.

The goal of the present study was to explore the role of FOXP3 in HQ-induced malignant progression of U937 human leukemia cells. U937 cells were treated with 5 muM HQ for 24 h, and the cells were re-suspended in serum-containing medium without HQ for 2 days. The same procedure was repeated three times, and the resulting U937/HQ cells were maintained in cultured medium containing 5 muM HQ. Proliferation and colony formation of U937/HQ cells were notably higher than those of U937 cells. Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase-mediated demethylation of the Treg-specific demethylated region in FOXP3 gene resulted in higher FOXP3 expression in U937/HQ cells than in U937 cells. FOXP3-induced miR-183 expression reduced beta-TrCP mRNA stability and suppressed beta-TrCP-mediated Sp1 degradation, leading to up-regulation of Sp1 expression in U937/HQ cells. Sp1 up-regulation further increased ADAM17 and Lyn expression, and ADAM17 up-regulation stimulated Lyn activation in U937/HQ cells. Moreover, U937/HQ cells showed higher Lyn-mediated Akt activation and cytoplasmic p21 expression than U937 cells did. Abolishment of Akt activation decreased cytoplasmic p21 expression in U937/HQ cells. Suppression of FOXP3, ADAM17, and Lyn expression, as well as Akt inactivation, repressed proliferation and clonogenicity of U937/HQ cells. Together with the finding that cytoplasmic p21 shows anti-apoptotic and oncogenic activities in cancer cells, the present data suggest a role of FOXP3/ADAM17/Lyn/Akt/p21 signaling axis in HQ-induced hematological disorders.","['Chen, Ying-Jung', 'Liu, Wen-Hsin', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Chen YJ', 'Liu WH', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, 804, Taiwan. lschang@mail.nsysu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, 807, Taiwan. lschang@mail.nsysu.edu.tw.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160615,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 protein, human)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['ADAM17 Protein/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/metabolism/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['ADAM17/Lyn/Akt/p21 axis', 'FOXP3', 'Hydroquinone', 'Leukemia', 'Malignant progression']",2016/06/17 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/06/17 06:00'],"['2016/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00204-016-1753-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00204-016-1753-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2017 Feb;91(2):983-997. doi: 10.1007/s00204-016-1753-4.

The activity in these enzymes correlates with the genetic polymorphism of the TPMT and ITPA genes, respectively, which determines an individual reaction and dosing of thiopurines. Three main TPMT alleles: TPMT*2 (c.238G>C), TPMT*3A (c.460G>A, c.719A>G) and TPMT*3C (c.719A>G) account for 80-95 % of inherited TPMT deficiency in different populations in the world. In the ITPA gene, a c.94C>A mutation is significantly associated with an adverse thiopurine reaction. The aim of this study was to develop a quick and highly sensitive method for determining major TPMT and ITPA alleles. Here we present the molecular test for genotyping c.238G>C, c.460G>A, c.719A>G and c.94C>A changes based on multiplex high resolution melting analysis (HRMA). We analyzed DNA samples from 100 clinically diagnosed IBD patients treated with thiopurine drugs, and a known genotype in the positions 238, 460 and 719 of the TPMT gene as well as in position 94 of the ITPA gene. Our results obtained with multiplex HRMA indicated 100 % accuracy in comparison with data from restriction fragments length polymorphism (RFLP) and standard DNA sequencing. We conclude, that multiplex HRMA can be used as a quick, sensitive and efficient alternative diagnostic method compared to conventional techniques for the determination of TPMT*2, TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C alleles and c.94C>A change in the ITPA gene.","['Skrzypczak-Zielinska, Marzena', 'Borun, Pawel', 'Bartkowiak-Kaczmarek, Anna', 'Zakerska-Banaszak, Oliwia', 'Walczak, Michal', 'Dobrowolska, Agnieszka', 'Kurzawski, Mateusz', 'Waszak, Malgorzata', 'Lipinski, Daniel', 'Plawski, Andrzej', 'Slomski, Ryszard']","['Skrzypczak-Zielinska M', 'Borun P', 'Bartkowiak-Kaczmarek A', 'Zakerska-Banaszak O', 'Walczak M', 'Dobrowolska A', 'Kurzawski M', 'Waszak M', 'Lipinski D', 'Plawski A', 'Slomski R']","['Institute of Human Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, ul.

TKI therapy also turned CML blastic transformation into a rare event; however, disease progression still occurs in those patients who are refractory, not compliant with TKI therapy or develop resistance to multiple TKIs. In the past few years, it became clear that the BCRABL1 oncogene does not operate alone to drive disease emergence, maintenance and progression. Indeed, it seems that bone marrow (BM) microenvironment-generated signals and cell autonomous BCRABL1 kinase-independent genetic and epigenetic alterations all contribute to: i. persistence of a quiescent leukemic stem cell (LSC) reservoir, ii. innate or acquired resistance to TKIs, and iii. progression into the fatal blast crisis stage. Herein, we review the intricate leukemic network in which aberrant, but finely tuned, survival, mitogenic and self-renewal signals are generated by leukemic progenitors, stromal cells, immune cells and metabolic microenvironmental conditions (e.g. hypoxia) to promote LSC maintenance and blastic transformation.","['Perrotti, Danilo', 'Silvestri, Giovannino', 'Stramucci, Lorenzo', 'Yu, Justine', 'Trotta, Rossana']","['Perrotti D', 'Silvestri G', 'Stramucci L', 'Yu J', 'Trotta R']","['Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Stem cells', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*hematopoietic stem cell.', '*microenvironment']",2016/06/17 06:00,2017/09/15 06:00,['2016/06/17 06:00'],"['2015/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.2174/1389450117666160615074120 [doi]', 'CDT-EPUB-76566 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2017;18(4):377-388. doi: 10.2174/1389450117666160615074120.,10.2174/1389450117666160615074120 [doi],"['R01 CA163800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA209183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5970649,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",,['NIHMS967522'],,,,,,,,,,

The production of IL-1beta is dependent upon caspase-1-containing multiprotein complexes called inflammasomes and IL-1R1/MyD88/NF-kappaB pathway. In this study, we explored whether a potential anti-fibrotic agent fluorofenidone (FD) exerts its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects through suppressing activation of NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NALP3) inflammasome and the IL-1beta/IL-1R1/MyD88/NF-kappaB pathway in vivo and in vitro. Male C57BL/6J mice were intratracheally injected with Bleomycin (BLM) or saline. Fluorofenidone was administered throughout the course of the experiment. Lung tissue sections were stained with haemotoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome. Cytokines were measured by ELISA, and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), fibronectin, collagen I, caspase-1, IL-1R1, MyD88 were measured by Western blot and/or RT-PCR. The human actue monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1) were incubated with monosodium urate (MSU), with or without FD pre-treatment. The expression of caspase-1, IL-1beta, NALP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing (ASC) and pro-caspase-1 were measured by Western blot, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was detected using the Flow Cytometry, and the interaction of NALP3 inflammasome-associated molecules were measured by Co-immunoprecipitation. RLE-6TN (rat lung epithelial-T-antigen negative) cells were incubated with IL-1beta, with or without FD pre-treatment. The expression of nuclear protein p65 was measured by Western blot. Results showed that FD markedly reduced the expressions of IL-1beta, IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), alpha-SMA, fibronectin, collagen I, caspase-1, IL-1R1 and MyD88 in mice lung tissues. And FD inhibited MSU-induced the accumulation of ROS, blocked the interaction of NALP3 inflammasome-associated molecules, decreased the level of caspase-1 and IL-1beta in THP-1 cells. Besides, FD inhibited IL-1beta-induced the expression of nuclear protein p65.

In particular, cytotoxic chemotherapy may lead to irreversible spermatogenic dysfunction. Microdissection testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE) is the only method that can address infertility in cancer survivors with persistent postchemotherapy azoospermia. METHODS: We included 66 Japanese patients with postchemotherapy azoospermia who underwent micro-TESE for sperm retrieval in this analysis. Age, oncology data, hormone profiles, and outcomes of micro-TESE and subsequent intracytoplasmic sperm injections (ICSIs) were reviewed. RESULTS: The common disease in our patients was testicular cancer (21 patients), followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma (nine patients). In this cohort of 66 patients, sperm was successfully retrieved in 31 patients (47 %), and clinical pregnancy occurred in 23 cases (35 %). The live birth rate was 27 %. No significant differences in sperm retrieval, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates were seen between testicular cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or sarcoma cases. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the chance of retrieving sperm during micro-TESE could not be predicted by any variable. CONCLUSIONS: Cryopreservation of sperm should be offered before any gonadotoxic chemotherapy takes place. However, micro-TESE and subsequent ICSI could be effective treatment options for patients with persistent postchemotherapy azoospermia whose sperm were not frozen before therapy. Our results suggest that micro-TESE-ICSI could benefit 27 % of such Japanese patients.","['Shin, Takeshi', 'Kobayashi, Tomohiro', 'Shimomura, Yukihito', 'Iwahata, Toshiyuki', 'Suzuki, Keisuke', 'Tanaka, Takashi', 'Fukushima, Mai', 'Kurihara, Megumi', 'Miyata, Akane', 'Kobori, Yoshitomo', 'Okada, Hiroshi']","['Shin T', 'Kobayashi T', 'Shimomura Y', 'Iwahata T', 'Suzuki K', 'Tanaka T', 'Fukushima M', 'Kurihara M', 'Miyata A', 'Kobori Y', 'Okada H']","['Department of Urology, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, 2-1-50 Minamikoshigaya, Koshigaya, Saitama, 343-8555, Japan. shintakeshi@nifty.com.', 'Center for Reproductive Medicine, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, 2-1-50 Minamikoshigaya, Koshigaya, Saitama, 343-8555, Japan. shintakeshi@nifty.com.', 'Department of Urology, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, 2-1-50 Minamikoshigaya, Koshigaya, Saitama, 343-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, 2-1-50 Minamikoshigaya, Koshigaya, Saitama, 343-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, 2-1-50 Minamikoshigaya, Koshigaya, Saitama, 343-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, 2-1-50 Minamikoshigaya, Koshigaya, Saitama, 343-8555, Japan.', 'Center for Reproductive Medicine, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, 2-1-50 Minamikoshigaya, Koshigaya, Saitama, 343-8555, Japan.', 'Center for Reproductive Medicine, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, 2-1-50 Minamikoshigaya, Koshigaya, Saitama, 343-8555, Japan.', 'Center for Reproductive Medicine, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, 2-1-50 Minamikoshigaya, Koshigaya, Saitama, 343-8555, Japan.', 'Center for Reproductive Medicine, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, 2-1-50 Minamikoshigaya, Koshigaya, Saitama, 343-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, 2-1-50 Minamikoshigaya, Koshigaya, Saitama, 343-8555, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, 2-1-50 Minamikoshigaya, Koshigaya, Saitama, 343-8555, Japan.', 'Center for Reproductive Medicine, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, 2-1-50 Minamikoshigaya, Koshigaya, Saitama, 343-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160615,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Azoospermia/chemically induced/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology', '*Cryopreservation/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', '*Infertility, Male/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Microdissection/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/classification/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sperm Injections, Intracytoplasmic/*methods', '*Sperm Retrieval', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Azoospermia', 'Cancer survivor', 'Chemotherapy', 'Infertility', 'Male', 'Testicular sperm retrieval']",2016/06/17 06:00,2017/01/12 06:00,['2016/06/17 06:00'],"['2016/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10147-016-0998-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s10147-016-0998-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2016 Dec;21(6):1167-1171. doi: 10.1007/s10147-016-0998-5.

RESULTS: Compared with controls, CDH1 was significantly downregulated in AML (p<0.001). The median level of CDH1 expression divided total AML patients into CDH1 low-expressed (CDH11ow) and CDH1 high-expressed (CDH1high) groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups in age, peripheral blood cell counts, complete remission (CR) rate, and the distribution of FAB/WHO subtypes as well as karyotypes/karyotypic classifications (p>0.05). However, CDH11ow group tended to have a higher bone marrow (BM) blasts (p=0.093). The spearman correlation analysis further illustrated a trend towards a negative correlation between CDH1 expression level and BM blasts (r=-0.214, p=0.052). CDH1low group had a tendency towards a lower frequency of N/K-RAS mutations (p=0.094). Furthermore, CDH1low patients had markedly shorter overall survival (OS) time in cytogenetic normal AML (CN-AML) (p=0.019). Both univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed the prognostic value of CDH1 expression in CN-AML patients (p=0.027 and 0.033, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: CDH1 downregulation acted as an independent prognostic biomarker in CN-AML patients.","['Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Deng, Zhao-Qun', 'Qian, Zhen', 'Yao, Dong-Ming', 'Yang, Jing', 'Li, Xi-Xi', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Zhang TJ', 'Zhou JD', 'Ma JC', 'Deng ZQ', 'Qian Z', 'Yao DM', 'Yang J', 'Li XX', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CDH1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cadherins/*genetics', 'Child', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/06/16 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/06/16 06:00'],"['2016/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1515/cclm-2016-0205 [doi]', '/j/cclm.ahead-of-print/cclm-2016-0205/cclm-2016-0205.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2017 Jan 1;55(1):123-131. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2016-0205.,10.1515/cclm-2016-0205 [doi] /j/cclm.2017.55.issue-1/cclm-2016-0205/cclm-2016-0205.xml [pii],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ensemble and bagging methods have been shown to work effectively in the process of gene selection and classification. Testament to that is random forest which combines random decision trees with bagging to improve overall feature selection and classification accuracy. Surprisingly, the adoption of these methods in support vector machines has only recently received attention but mostly on classification not gene selection. This paper introduces an ensemble SVM-Recursive Feature Elimination (ESVM-RFE) for gene selection that follows the concepts of ensemble and bagging used in random forest but adopts the backward elimination strategy which is the rationale of RFE algorithm. The rationale behind this is, building ensemble SVM models using randomly drawn bootstrap samples from the training set, will produce different feature rankings which will be subsequently aggregated as one feature ranking. As a result, the decision for elimination of features is based upon the ranking of multiple SVM models instead of choosing one particular model. Moreover, this approach will address the problem of imbalanced datasets by constructing a nearly balanced bootstrap sample. Our experiments show that ESVM-RFE for gene selection substantially increased the classification performance on five microarray datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on the childhood leukaemia dataset show that an average 9% better accuracy is achieved by ESVM-RFE over SVM-RFE, and 5% over random forest based approach. The selected genes by the ESVM-RFE algorithm were further explored with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) which reveals significant clusters with the selected data.","['Anaissi, Ali', 'Goyal, Madhu', 'Catchpoole, Daniel R', 'Braytee, Ali', 'Kennedy, Paul J']","['Anaissi A', 'Goyal M', 'Catchpoole DR', 'Braytee A', 'Kennedy PJ']","['Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems (QCIS), Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT), University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Broadway NSW 2007, Australia.', 'Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems (QCIS), Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT), University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Broadway NSW 2007, Australia.', ""The Tumour Bank, Children's Cancer Research Unit, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Locked Bag 4001, Westmead NSW 2145, Australia."", 'Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems (QCIS), Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT), University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Broadway NSW 2007, Australia.', 'Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems (QCIS), Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT), University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Broadway NSW 2007, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160615,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Child', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Data Mining/methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genomics/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Information Dissemination/methods', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Support Vector Machine']",,,2016/06/16 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2016/06/16 06:00'],"['2015/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0157330 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-32374 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jun 15;11(6):e0157330. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0157330. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0157330 [doi],,PMC4909287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In humans, recurrent/repeated implantation failure (RIF) may occur due to altered uterine receptivity with aberrant gene expression in the endometrium as well as genetic defects in embryos. Several studies have been performed to understand dynamic changes of uterine transcriptome during menstrual cycles in humans. However, uterine transcriptome of the patients with RIF has not been clearly investigated yet. Here we show that several signaling pathways as well as many genes and microRNAs are dysregulated in the endometrium of patients with RIF (RIFE). Whereas unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that overall mRNA and microRNA profiles of RIFE were similar to those of endometria of healthy women, many genes were significantly dysregulated in RIFE (cut off at 1.5 fold change). The majority (~75%) of differentially expressed genes in RIFE including S100 calcium binding protein P (S100P), Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 13 (CXCL13) and SIX homeobox 1 (SIX1) were down-regulated, suggesting that reduced uterine expression of these genes is associated with RIF. Gene Set Enrichment analyses (GSEA) for mRNA microarrays revealed that various signaling pathways including Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling and a P4 response were dysregulated in RIFE although expression levels of Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and Progesterone receptor (PR) were not significantly altered in RIFE. Furthermore, expression and phosphorylation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) are reduced and a gene set associated with Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling pathway is systemically down-regulated in these patients. Pairwise analyses of microRNA arrays with prediction of dysregulated microRNAs based on mRNA expression datasets demonstrated that 6 microRNAs are aberrantly regulated in RIFE. Collectively, we here suggest that dysregulation of several major signaling pathways and genes critical for uterine biology and embryo implantation may lead to uterine abnormalities in patients with RIF.","['Choi, Youngsok', 'Kim, Hye-Ryun', 'Lim, Eun Jin', 'Park, Miseon', 'Yoon, Jung Ah', 'Kim, Yeon Sun', 'Kim, Eun-Kyung', 'Shin, Ji-Eun', 'Kim, Ji Hyang', 'Kwon, Hwang', 'Song, Haengseok', 'Choi, Dong-Hee']","['Choi Y', 'Kim HR', 'Lim EJ', 'Park M', 'Yoon JA', 'Kim YS', 'Kim EK', 'Shin JE', 'Kim JH', 'Kwon H', 'Song H', 'Choi DH']","['Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Fertility Center of CHA Gangnam Medical Center, CHA University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Fertility Center of CHA Gangnam Medical Center, CHA University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Fertility Center of CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Fertility Center of CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Fertility Center of CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Fertility Center of CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Fertility Center of CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Fertility Center of CHA Bundang Medical Center, CHA University, Seongnam, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160615,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', 'Uterine Anomalies']",IM,"['Abortion, Habitual/genetics', 'Adult', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Embryo Implantation/genetics', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Progesterone/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', '*Transcriptome', 'Urogenital Abnormalities/genetics/metabolism', 'Uterus/abnormalities/*metabolism']",,,2016/06/16 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2016/06/16 06:00'],"['2016/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0157696 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-13673 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jun 15;11(6):e0157696. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0157696. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0157696 [doi],,PMC4909214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient had no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. Within a few months, his rapidly growing tumor was classified as T4aN2cM0. It could be assumed that the rapid increase in the tumor mass, which did not respond positively to treatment, might have been associated with the coexistence of the chronic myelogenous leukemia, which had been found incidentally. Genetic testing revealed the presence of insertion mutation 3020insC within the NOD2 gene, which might be an important genetic predisposing factor, not only for a single tumor such as laryngeal cancer, but also for multiple primary neoplasms. The presence of an NOD2 mutation could significantly worsen the course of the cancer. Therefore, given the relatively high frequency of 3020insC mutations in the general population, it might be reasonable to perform genetic testing on a wider scale for patients with head or neck cancer, particularly in cases that follow an atypical course. It is also worth emphasizing the importance of thorough and periodically repeated laryngeal examinations in patients with chronic leukemia.","['Fraczek, Marcin', 'Stembalska, Agnieszka', 'Karpinski, Pawel', 'Krecicki, Tomasz']","['Fraczek M', 'Stembalska A', 'Karpinski P', 'Krecicki T']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Wroclaw Medical University, Borowska Str. 213, 50-556 Wroclaw, Poland. raucedo@wp.pl.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Ear Nose Throat J,"Ear, nose, & throat journal",7701817,"['0 (NOD2 protein, human)', '0 (Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics/virology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*genetics/virology', 'Humans', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/*genetics/virology', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*genetics', 'Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein/*genetics', 'Papillomaviridae', '*Papillomavirus Infections', 'Pedigree', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck']",,,2016/06/16 06:00,2017/04/30 06:00,['2016/06/16 06:00'],"['2016/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ear Nose Throat J. 2016 Jun;95(6):E1-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to identify putative downstream targets/effectors involved in the pro-oncogenic activity of Cn in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) we used tandem affinity chromatography, followed by mass spectrometry to purify novel Cn-interacting partners. We found the Cn-interacting proteins to be part of numerous cellular signaling pathways including eIF2 signaling and mTOR signaling. Coherently, modulation of Cn activity in T-ALL cells determined alterations in the phosphorylation status of key molecules implicated in protein translation such as eIF-2alpha and ribosomal protein S6. Joint targeting of PI3K-mTOR, eIF-2alpha and 14-3-3 signaling pathways with Cn unveiled novel synergistic pro-apoptotic drug combinations. Further analysis disclosed that the synergistic interaction between PI3K-mTOR and Cn inhibitors was prevalently due to AKT inhibition. Finally, we showed that the synergistic pro-apoptotic response determined by jointly targeting AKT and Cn pathways was linked to down-modulation of key anti-apoptotic proteins including Mcl-1, Claspin and XIAP. In conclusion, we identify AKT inhibition as a novel promising drug combination to potentiate the pro-apoptotic effects of Cn inhibitors.","['Tosello, Valeria', 'Saccomani, Valentina', 'Yu, Jiyang', 'Bordin, Fulvio', 'Amadori, Alberto', 'Piovan, Erich']","['Tosello V', 'Saccomani V', 'Yu J', 'Bordin F', 'Amadori A', 'Piovan E']","['UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, Padova, 35128, Italy.', ""Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Sezione di Oncologia, Universita' di Padova, Padova, 35128, Italy."", 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Present address: Department of Precision Medicine, Oncology Research Unit, Pfizer Inc., Pearl River, NY, 10965, USA.', ""Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Sezione di Oncologia, Universita' di Padova, Padova, 35128, Italy."", 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, Padova, 35128, Italy.', ""Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Sezione di Oncologia, Universita' di Padova, Padova, 35128, Italy."", 'UOC Immunologia e Diagnostica Molecolare Oncologica, Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, Padova, 35128, Italy.', ""Dipartimento di Scienze Chirurgiche, Oncologiche e Gastroenterologiche, Sezione di Oncologia, Universita' di Padova, Padova, 35128, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcineurin Inhibitors)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (MK 2206)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP3CA protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcineurin/*metabolism', 'Calcineurin Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'calcineurin', 'mTOR signaling', 'protein complex']",2016/06/16 06:00,2018/01/09 06:00,['2016/06/16 06:00'],"['2015/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['9933 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9933 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 19;7(29):45715-45729. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9933.,10.18632/oncotarget.9933 [doi],,PMC5216755,['The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that 72% of cancer-associated ATM mutations are missense mutations that are enriched around the kinase domain. Expression of kinase-dead ATM (Atm(KD/-)) is more oncogenic than loss of ATM (Atm(-/-)) in mouse models, leading to earlier and more frequent lymphomas with Pten deletions. Kinase-dead ATM protein (Atm-KD), but not loss of ATM (Atm-null), prevents replication-dependent removal of Topo-isomerase I-DNA adducts at the step of strand cleavage, leading to severe genomic instability and hypersensitivity to Topo-isomerase I inhibitors. Correspondingly, Topo-isomerase I inhibitors effectively and preferentially eliminate Atm(KD/-), but not Atm-proficientor Atm(-/-) leukemia in animal models.

In this study, we explored the expression and function of miR-145 in OS. We found that miR-145 was consistently under-expressed in OS tissues and cell lines as compared to normal bone tissues and osteoblast cells. Ectopic expression of miR-145 in OS cells inhibited their proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis. miR-145 targets a putative microRNA regulatory element (MRE) in the 3'-UTR of friend leukemia virus integration 1 gene (FLI-1), and its abundance was inversely related to FLI-1 expression in OS tissues and cell lines. miR-145 decreased expression FLI-1 protein and mRNA, but mutation of the miR-145 MRE sequence in the FLI-1 3'-UTR abolished the activity of miR-145 in a reporter assay. Restored expression of FLI-1 diminished miR-145-mediated suppression of tumor progression. These results suggest that miR-145 acts as a tumor suppressor by directly reducing expression of FLI-1, and that the miR-145/FLI-1 pathway is important for tumor progression in OS.","['Wu, Panfeng', 'Liang, Jieyu', 'Yu, Fang', 'Zhou, Zhengbing', 'Tang, Juyu', 'Li, Kanghua']","['Wu P', 'Liang J', 'Yu F', 'Zhou Z', 'Tang J', 'Li K']","[""Department of Orthopedics, Xiang Ya Hospital Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, Xiang Ya Hospital Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, Xiang Ya Hospital Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, Xiang Ya Hospital Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, Xiang Ya Hospital Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, Xiang Ya Hospital Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (FLI1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN145 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Osteosarcoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['FLI-1', 'miR-145', 'osteosarcoma']",2016/06/16 06:00,2018/01/23 06:00,['2016/06/16 06:00'],"['2015/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['9948 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9948 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 5;7(27):42241-42251. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9948.,10.18632/oncotarget.9948 [doi],,PMC5173131,['The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, much is currently not understood regarding the precise mechanisms that attribute to this immunosuppressive phenotype in CLL. To provide further clarity to this particular phenomenon, we analyzed the T-cell profile of CLL patient samples within a large cohort and observed that patients with an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio had a shorter time to first treatment as well as overall survival. These observations coincided with higher expression of the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 in CLL patient CD8+ T cells when compared to age-matched healthy donors. Interestingly, we discovered that increased PD-1 expression in CD8+ T cells corresponds with decreased DNA methylation levels in a distal upstream locus of the PD-1 gene PDCD1. Further analysis using luciferase reporter assays suggests that the identified PDCD1 distal upstream region acts as an enhancer for PDCD1 transcription and this region becomes demethylated during activation of naive CD8+ T cells by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies and IL2. Finally, we conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis comparing CD8+ T cells from CLL patients against healthy donors and identified additional differentially methylated genes with known immune regulatory functions including CCR6 and KLRG1. Taken together, our findings reveal the occurrence of epigenetic reprogramming taking place within CLL patient CD8+ T cells and highlight the potential mechanism of how immunosuppression is accomplished in CLL.","['Wu, Jiazhu', 'Xu, Xiaojing', 'Lee, Eun-Joon', 'Shull, Austin Y', 'Pei, Lirong', 'Awan, Farrukh', 'Wang, Xiaoling', 'Choi, Jeong-Hyeon', 'Deng, Libin', 'Xin, Hong-Bo', 'Zhong,

LMO2-overexpressing transgenic mouse models suggest an accumulation of immature T-cell progenitors in the thymus as the main preleukemic event. The effects of LMO2 overexpression on human T-cell development in vivo are unknown. Here, we report studies of a humanized mouse model transplanted with LMO2-transduced human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The effects of LMO2 overexpression were confined to the T-cell lineage; however, initially, multipotent cells were transduced. Three effects of LMO2 on human T-cell development were observed: (1) a block at the double-negative/immature single-positive stage, (2) an accumulation of CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive CD3(-) cells, and (3) an altered CD8/CD4 ratio with enhanced peripheral T lymphocytes. Microarray analysis of sorted double-positive cells overexpressing LMO2 led to the identification of an LMO2 gene set that clustered with human T-ALL patient samples of the described ""proliferative"" cluster. In this article, we demonstrate previously unrecognized mechanisms by which LMO2 alters human T-cell development in vivo; these mechanisms correlate with human T-ALL leukemogenesis.","['Wiekmeijer, Anna-Sophia', 'Pike-Overzet, Karin', 'Brugman, Martijn H', 'van Eggermond, Marja C J A', 'Cordes, Martijn', 'de Haas, Edwin F E', 'Li, Yunlei', 'Oole, Edwin', 'van IJcken, Wilfred F J', 'Egeler, R Maarten', 'Meijerink, Jules P', 'Staal, Frank J T']","['Wiekmeijer AS', 'Pike-Overzet K', 'Brugman MH', 'van Eggermond MCJA', 'Cordes M', 'de Haas EFE', 'Li Y', 'Oole E', 'van IJcken WFJ', 'Egeler RM', 'Meijerink JP', 'Staal FJT']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Biomics, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Biomics, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands; Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children/University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.

MRD assessment consisted of Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) detection with PCR and leukemia-associated immunophenotypic pattern examination with multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM). Post-HSCT, 31 patients were positive for WT1, and 8, for FCM; positivity for WT1 (18.6 vs. 6.1 %, P = 0.040) or FCM (62.5 vs. 3.6 %, P < 0.001) indicated a higher 2-year relapse rate. Twenty-one patients met our combined criteria for MRD, and the presence of MRD was associated with a higher 2-year relapse rate (27.3 vs. 4.5 %, P = 0.003). Preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma (PRAME) expression alone was not an appropriate MRD marker; however, it suggested that the MRD-positive patients may fail to respond to preemptive immunotherapy. In patients positive for both PRAME and MRD, the relapse rate was 60 % despite preemptive immunotherapy. Multivariate analysis confirmed the association between the increased relapse rate and positivity for both PRAME and MRD (hazard ratio = 42.8, P = 0.001). MRD monitoring predicted relapse in high-risk MDS post-HSCT patients, and PRAME- and MRD-positive patients did not benefit from preemptive immunotherapy.","['Mo, Xiao-Dong', 'Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Wang, Yu', 'Yan, Chen-Hua', 'Chen, Huan', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Han, Wei', 'Wang, Feng-Rong', 'Wang, Jing-Zhi', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Mo XD', 'Qin YZ', 'Zhang XH', 'Xu LP', 'Wang Y', 'Yan CH', 'Chen H', 'Chen YH', 'Han W', 'Wang FR', 'Wang JZ', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No. 11 Xizhimen South Street, Xicheng District, Beijing, 100044, China. huangxiaojun@bjmu.edu.cn."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China. huangxiaojun@bjmu.edu.cn.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, China. huangxiaojun@bjmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160614,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Child', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Minimal residual disease', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma', ""Wilms' tumor gene 1""]",2016/06/16 06:00,2017/02/06 06:00,['2016/06/16 06:00'],"['2016/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2706-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2706-y [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Aug;95(8):1233-40. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2706-y.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of birinapant, a small-molecule mimetic of the apoptotic regulator SMAC, against a diverse set of ALL subtypes. Birinapant exhibited potent and selective cytotoxicity against B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) cells that were cultured ex vivo or in vivo as patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX). Cytotoxicity was consistently most acute in Ph-like BCP-ALL. Unbiased gene expression analysis of BCP-ALL PDX specimens identified a 68-gene signature associated with birinapant sensitivity, including an enrichment for genes involved in inflammatory response, hematopoiesis, and cell death pathways. All Ph-like PDXs analyzed clustered within this 68-gene classifier. Mechanistically, birinapant sensitivity was associated with expression of TNF receptor TNFR1 and was abrogated by interfering with the TNFalpha/TNFR1 interaction. In combination therapy, birinapant enhanced the in vivo efficacy of an induction-type regimen of vincristine, dexamethasone, and L-asparaginase against Ph-like ALL xenografts, offering a preclinical rationale to further evaluate this SMAC mimetic for BCP-ALL treatment.

In utero and early life exposures to air toxics such as benzene and 1,3-butadiene, which are known leukemogens in adults, may play an etiologic role in childhood leukemia that comprises the majority of pediatric cancers. We conducted a population based case-control study to examine individual effects of benzene, 1,3-butadiene and polycyclic organic matter (POM) in ambient residential air on acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed in children under age 5 years in Texas from 1995-2011. METHODS: Texas Cancer Registry cases were linked to birth records and then were frequency matched by birth month and year to 10 population-based controls. Maternal and infant characteristics from birth certificates were abstracted to obtain information about potential confounders. Modelled estimates of benzene, 1,3-butadiene and POM exposures at the census tract level were assigned by linking geocoded maternal addresses from birth certificates to U.S. EPA National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment data for single and co-pollutant statistical analyses. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were applied to evaluate associations between air toxics and childhood leukemia. RESULTS: In adjusted single pollutant models, odds of childhood leukemia among mothers with the highest ambient air exposures compared to those in the lowest quartile were 1.11 (95 % CI: 0.94-1.32) for POM, 1.17 (95 % CI: 0.98-1.39) for benzene and 1.29 (95 % CI: 1.08-1.52) for 1,3-butadiene. In co-pollutant models, odds ratios for childhood leukemia remained elevated for 1,3-butadiene but were close to the null value for benzene and POM. CONCLUSIONS: We observed positive associations between 1,3-butadiene and childhood leukemia in single and co-pollutant models whereas effect estimates from single pollutant models were diminished for benzene and POM in co-pollutant models. Early life exposure to 1,3-butadiene rather than benzene or POM appears to increase early childhood risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia.","['Symanski, Elaine', 'Tee Lewis, P Grace', 'Chen, Ting-Yu', 'Chan, Wenyaw', 'Lai, Dejian', 'Ma, Xiaomei']","['Symanski E', 'Tee Lewis PG', 'Chen TY', 'Chan W', 'Lai D', 'Ma X']","['Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health, Houston, Texas, USA.

The subsets also differ in the incidence of high-risk genetic aberrations and in DNA methylation profile, preserved from the maturational status of the original cell. We focused on sIgM expression and function, measured as intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization following stimulation, and probed correlations with clinical outcome. The relationship with genetic features and maturation status defined by DNA methylation of an 18-gene panel signature was then investigated. sIgM levels/signaling were higher and less variable in U-CLL than in M-CLL and correlated with disease progression between and within U-CLL and M-CLL. In U-CLL, increased levels/signaling associated with +12, del(17p) or NOTCH1 mutations. In M-CLL, there were fewer genetic lesions, although the methylation maturation status, generally higher than in U-CLL, varied and was increased in cases with lower sIgM levels/signaling. These features revealed heterogeneity in M-CLL and U-CLL with clear clinical correlations. Multivariate analyses with phenotype, genetic lesions, or DNA methylation maturation status identified high sIgM levels as a new potential independent factor for disease progression. Multiple influences on sIgM include the cell of origin, the clonal history of antigen encounter in vivo, and genetic damage. This simple marker compiles these different factors into an indicator worthy of further investigations for prediction of clinical behavior, particularly within the heterogeneous M-CLL subset.","[""D'Avola, Annalisa"", 'Drennan, Samantha', 'Tracy, Ian', 'Henderson, Isla', 'Chiecchio, Laura', 'Larrayoz, Marta', 'Rose-Zerilli, Matthew', 'Strefford, Jonathan', 'Plass, Christoph', 'Johnson, Peter W', 'Steele, Andrew J', 'Packham, Graham', 'Stevenson, Freda K', 'Oakes, Christopher C', 'Forconi, Francesco']","[""D'Avola A"", 'Drennan S', 'Tracy I', 'Henderson I', 'Chiecchio L', 'Larrayoz M', 'Rose-Zerilli M', 'Strefford J', 'Plass C', 'Johnson PW', 'Steele AJ', 'Packham G', 'Stevenson FK', 'Oakes CC', 'Forconi F']","['Haematology Oncology Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, and Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Haematology Oncology Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, and Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Haematology Oncology Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, and Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, Salisbury, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom;

Its role in somatic stem cells, however, remains unclear because of the early death of Setdb1-deficient embryos. We demonstrate here that Setdb1 is the first H3K9 methyltransferase shown to be essential for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in mice. The deletion of Setdb1 caused the rapid depletion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), as well as leukemic stem cells. In contrast to ESCs, ERVs were largely repressed in Setdb1-deficient HSPCs. A list of nonhematopoietic genes was instead ectopically activated in HSPCs after reductions in H3K9me3 levels, including key gluconeogenic enzyme genes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (Fbp1) and Fbp2 The ectopic activation of gluconeogenic enzymes antagonized glycolysis and impaired ATP production, resulting in a compromised repopulating capacity of HSPCs. Our results demonstrate that Setdb1 maintains HSPCs by restricting the ectopic activation of nonhematopoietic genes detrimental to their function and uncover that the gluconeogenic pathway is one of the critical targets of Setdb1 in HSPCs.","['Koide, Shuhei', 'Oshima, Motohiko', 'Takubo, Keiyo', 'Yamazaki, Satoshi', 'Nitta, Eriko', 'Saraya, Atsunori', 'Aoyama, Kazumasa', 'Kato, Yuko', 'Miyagi, Satoru', 'Nakajima-Takagi, Yaeko', 'Chiba, Tetsuhiro', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Arai, Fumio', 'Suzuki, Yutaka', 'Kimura, Hiroshi', 'Nakauchi, Hiromitsu', 'Suda, Toshio', 'Shinkai, Yoichi', 'Iwama, Atsushi']","['Koide S', 'Oshima M', 'Takubo K', 'Yamazaki S', 'Nitta E', 'Saraya A', 'Aoyama K', 'Kato Y', 'Miyagi S', 'Nakajima-Takagi Y', 'Chiba T', 'Matsui H', 'Arai F', 'Suzuki Y', 'Kimura H', 'Nakauchi H', 'Suda T', 'Shinkai Y', 'Iwama A']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', 'Department of Medicine and Clinical Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', 'Department of Molecular Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan;', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan;', 'Laboratory of Functional Genomics, Department of Medical Genome Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan;', 'Division of Stem Cell Therapy, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA;', 'Cancer Science Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto City, Japan; and.', 'Cellular Memory Laboratory, RIKEN, Wako, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160614,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (SETDB1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gluconeogenesis/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Homeostasis/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology']",,,2016/06/16 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/06/16 06:00'],"['2016/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34282-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-01-694810 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Aug 4;128(5):638-49. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-01-694810.

In contrast, the prognostic significance of varying fibrinogen levels in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at diagnosis is unknown. In this study, we assessed the prognostic significance of fibrinogen levels in AML patients. In a comprehensive retrospective single-center study, we determined the survival rates of 375 consecutive AML patients undergoing at least one cycle of intensive chemotherapy induction treatment. Patients were dichotomized between low (<4.1 g/L) and high fibrinogen levels (>/=4.1 g/L) at diagnosis of AML before initiation of treatment. Subsequently, quartile ranges were applied to analyze the association of varying fibrinogen levels on survival. We observed that the rates of complete remission, early death, and admission to intensive care unit were equal in the low versus high fibrinogen group. However, OS was significantly better in the low fibrinogen group (27.3 vs 13.5 months; p = 0.0009) as well as progression-free survival (12.3 vs 7.8 months; p = 0.0076). This survival difference remained significant in the multivariate analysis (p = 0.003). Assessing quartiles of fibrinogen values, we further confirmed this observation. Our data suggest that high fibrinogen levels at diagnosis of AML are associated with unfavorable OS and progression-free survival but not with increased mortality during induction treatment.

Although Myc transcription factors play a major role in stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency, their integration with signalling pathways and epigenetic regulators remains poorly defined. We addressed this point by profiling the gene expression and epigenetic pattern in ESCs whose growth depends on conditional Myc activity. Here we show that Myc potentiates the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway, which cooperates with the transcriptional regulatory network in sustaining ESC self-renewal. Myc activation results in the transcriptional repression of Wnt antagonists through the direct recruitment of PRC2 on these targets. The consequent potentiation of the autocrine Wnt/beta-catenin signalling induces the transcriptional activation of the endogenous Myc family members, which in turn activates a Myc-driven self-reinforcing circuit. Thus, our data unravel a Myc-dependent self-propagating epigenetic memory in the maintenance of ESC self-renewal capacity.","['Fagnocchi, Luca', 'Cherubini, Alessandro', 'Hatsuda, Hiroshi', 'Fasciani, Alessandra', 'Mazzoleni, Stefania', 'Poli, Vittoria', 'Berno, Valeria', 'Rossi, Riccardo L', 'Reinbold, Rolland', 'Endele, Max', 'Schroeder, Timm', 'Rocchigiani, Marina', 'Szkarlat, Zaneta', 'Oliviero, Salvatore', 'Dalton, Stephen', 'Zippo, Alessio']","['Fagnocchi L', 'Cherubini A', 'Hatsuda H', 'Fasciani A', 'Mazzoleni S', 'Poli V', 'Berno V', 'Rossi RL', 'Reinbold R', 'Endele M', 'Schroeder T', 'Rocchigiani M', 'Szkarlat Z', 'Oliviero S', 'Dalton S', 'Zippo A']","[""Department of Epigenetics, Fondazione Istituto Nazionale di Genetica Molecolare 'Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi', Via Francesco Sforza 35, Milan 20122, Italy."", ""Department of Epigenetics, Fondazione Istituto Nazionale di Genetica Molecolare 'Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi', Via Francesco Sforza 35, Milan 20122, Italy."", ""Department of Epigenetics, Fondazione Istituto Nazionale di Genetica Molecolare 'Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi', Via Francesco Sforza 35, Milan 20122, Italy."", ""Department of Epigenetics, Fondazione Istituto Nazionale di Genetica Molecolare 'Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi', Via Francesco Sforza 35, Milan 20122, Italy."", ""Department of Epigenetics, Fondazione Istituto Nazionale di Genetica Molecolare 'Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi', Via Francesco Sforza 35, Milan 20122, Italy."", ""Department of Epigenetics, Fondazione Istituto Nazionale di Genetica Molecolare 'Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi', Via Francesco Sforza 35, Milan 20122, Italy."", ""Department of Epigenetics, Fondazione Istituto Nazionale di Genetica Molecolare 'Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi', Via Francesco Sforza 35, Milan 20122, Italy."", ""Department of Epigenetics, Fondazione Istituto Nazionale di Genetica Molecolare 'Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi', Via Francesco Sforza 35, Milan 20122, Italy."", 'Institute of Biomedical Technologies, National Research Council, via Cervi 93, Segrate-Milan 20090, Italy.', 'Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Mattenstrasse 26, Basel 4058, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Mattenstrasse 26, Basel 4058, Switzerland.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie, Chimica e Farmacia Universita di Siena, Via Fiorentina 1, Siena 53100, Italy.', 'Human Genetic Foundation (HuGeF), via Nizza 52, Torino 10126, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie, Chimica e Farmacia Universita di Siena, Via Fiorentina 1, Siena 53100, Italy.', 'Human Genetic Foundation (HuGeF), via Nizza 52, Torino 10126, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie, Chimica e Farmacia Universita di Siena, Via Fiorentina 1, Siena 53100, Italy.', 'Human Genetic Foundation (HuGeF), via Nizza 52, Torino 10126, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Georgia, 500 D.W.

Complete response rate in patients with untreated HCL, relapsed HCL and HCLv was 100%, 100% and 86%, respectively. With a median follow up of 60 months, 5-year failure-free survival (FFS) in patients with untreated HCL, relapsed HCL and HCLv was 95%, 100% and 64%, respectively. Median duration of response to the cladribine followed by rituximab was significantly longer than the first-line cladribine single agent in patients who received this treatment as second-line treatment (72 months vs not reached, P = 0.004). Almost all patients (94%) achieved negative minimal residual disease (MRD) after the treatment. Positive MRD during the follow up did not necessarily result in clinically relevant relapse. Cladribine followed by rituximab is highly effective even in patients with relapsed disease and HCLv, and can achieve durable remission.","['Chihara, Dai', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Poku, Rebecca', 'Jain, Preetesh', 'Thompson, Phillip', 'Brandt, Mark', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Burger, Jan', 'Keating, Michael', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Chihara D', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Jorgensen J', 'Pierce S', 'Faderl S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Poku R', 'Jain P', 'Thompson P', 'Brandt M', 'Luthra R', 'Burger J', 'Keating M', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",20160615,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab/*administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Hairy cell leukaemia', '*cladribine', '*phase II study', '*rituximab']",2016/06/16 06:00,2017/06/07 06:00,['2016/06/16 06:00'],"['2016/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.14129 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Sep;174(5):760-6. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14129.

Orbital granulocytic sarcoma is rarer still, with only a small fraction of GS patients having orbital involvement. Given the rarity of orbital GS, no unified therapy plan has been identified, as large prospective trials are not feasible, but it is widely accepted that patients with GS ought to be treated with systemic intensive chemotherapy consistent with standard of care regimens for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Development of a treatment plan for GS in poor responders involves a systemic leukemia plan as novel therapeutics have not been investigated for treatment GS per se, but used more widely for AML. GS is most commonly associated with AML and thus will be addressed in that context in this review. Patients with GS associated with CML should receive CML-specific therapy. When conventional and traditional cytotoxic GS/AML chemotherapy regimens are insufficient, patients often require a combination of novel therapeutics, stem cell transplantation (SCT), and radiation. Much of the recent advancement in AML therapy, as well as in AML translational research, has been in targeting molecular facets of the disease and enabling more specificity with treatment. The aim of treating patients for whom conventional treatment was unsuccessful with personalized therapy has not yet been realized, but many of the novel therapeutics reviewed below have demonstrated promise and are cause for optimism. In our center, when a GS/AML patient is refractory to frontline therapy, we rely on novel chemotherapy therapeutic options as outlined below.","['Gossai, Nathan', 'Cafferty, Rachel', 'Weigel, Brenda']","['Gossai N', 'Cafferty R', 'Weigel B']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital, Minneapolis, MN, 55455, USA. weige007@umn.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Orbital Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Bortezomib', '*Crenolanib', '*Gemtuzumab ozogamicin', '*Granulocytic sarcoma', '*Immunotherapy', '*Lestaurtinib', '*Novel therapeutics', '*Quizartinib', '*Ruxolitinib', '*Sorafenib', '*Vorinostat']",2016/06/15 06:00,2017/08/11 06:00,['2016/06/15 06:00'],"['2016/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-016-0411-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-016-0411-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2016 Jul;17(7):38. doi: 10.1007/s11864-016-0411-7.,10.1007/s11864-016-0411-7 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms through which DNMT3A normally suppresses malignancy development are unknown. Here, we show that DNMT3A loss synergizes with the FLT3 internal tandem duplication in a dose-influenced fashion to generate rapid lethal lymphoid or myeloid leukemias similar to their human counterparts. Loss of DNMT3A leads to reduced DNA methylation, predominantly at hematopoietic enhancer regions in both mouse and human samples. Myeloid and lymphoid diseases arise from transformed murine hematopoietic stem cells. Broadly, our findings support a role for DNMT3A as a guardian of the epigenetic state at enhancer regions, critical for inhibition of leukemic transformation.","['Yang, Liubin', 'Rodriguez, Benjamin', 'Mayle, Allison', 'Park, Hyun Jung', 'Lin, Xueqiu', 'Luo, Min', 'Jeong, Mira', 'Curry, Choladda V', 'Kim, Sang-Bae', 'Ruau, David', 'Zhang, Xiaotian', 'Zhou, Ting', 'Zhou, Michael', 'Rebel, Vivienne I', 'Challen, Grant A', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Lee, Ju-Seog', 'Rau, Rachel', 'Li, Wei', 'Goodell, Margaret A']","['Yang L', 'Rodriguez B', 'Mayle A', 'Park HJ', 'Lin X', 'Luo M', 'Jeong M', 'Curry CV', 'Kim SB', 'Ruau D', 'Zhang X', 'Zhou T', 'Zhou M', 'Rebel VI', 'Challen GA', 'Gottgens B', 'Lee JS', 'Rau R', 'Li W', 'Goodell MA']","['Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Dan L.

Regression was accompanied by upregulation of cell-cycle regulators and B cell differentiation genes, and downregulation of oncogenic signaling pathways. Expression of dominant-negative p53 delayed blast clearance upon miRNA-126 switch-off, highlighting the relevance of p53 inhibition in miRNA-126 addiction.

The current study aimed to assess the association of GSTM1 and GSTP1 genetic polymorphisms with the susceptibility of ALL. This case-control study (N=264) involved 88 Jordanian ALL children and 176 healthy controls from an ethnically homogenous Jordanian children population. The polymerase chain reaction assay was used to genotype GSTM1 (null/present) and the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique was also applied to detect the genetic polymorphisms of GSTP1 (Ile105Val) at the rs1695 position. The biallelic analysis revealed that there was no association between GSTM1 double-null genotype and ALL (P=0.57). However, there was a strong association between GSTP1 (Ile105Val) polymorphism genotypes and alleles within GSTP1 gene and ALL (P=0.00049 and 0.000044, respectively). A combination between GSTM1 double-null genotype and rs1695 also showed an association with ALL (P=0.042). This study showed that the rs1695 single nucleotide polymorphism within the GSTP1 gene is strongly implicated in ALL among Jordanian children with ALL. These results indicate that genetic variants of GSTP1 gene influence the risk of developing ALL in the Jordanian children of Arab ancestry.","['Al-Eitan, Laith N', ""Rababa'h, Doaa M"", 'Alkhatib, Rami Q', 'Khasawneh, Rame H', 'ALjarrah, Omaiema A']","['Al-Eitan LN', ""Rababa'h DM"", 'Alkhatib RQ', 'Khasawneh RH', 'ALjarrah OA']","['Departments of *Applied Biological Sciences daggerBiotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid double daggerDepartment of Hematopathology, King Hussein Medical Center (KHMC) section signDepartment of Paediatrics, Queen Rania Hospital, Jordan Royal Medical Services (RMS), Amman, Jordan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/*genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics']",,,2016/06/15 06:00,2017/08/31 06:00,['2016/06/15 06:00'],"['2016/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000609 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2016 Oct;38(7):e223-9. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000609.,10.1097/MPH.0000000000000609 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is because reported frequencies vary widely across studies, partly because of diverse definitions of toxic effects. Using the Delphi method, 15 international childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia study groups assessed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia protocols to address toxic effects that were to be considered by the Ponte di Legno working group. 14 acute toxic effects (hypersensitivity to asparaginase, hyperlipidaemia, osteonecrosis, asparaginase-associated pancreatitis, arterial hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, seizures, depressed level of consciousness, methotrexate-related stroke-like syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, high-dose methotrexate-related nephrotoxicity, sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, thromboembolism, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) that are serious but too rare to be addressed comprehensively within any single group, or are deemed to need consensus definitions for reliable incidence comparisons, were selected for assessment. Our results showed that none of the protocols addressed all 14 toxic effects, that no two protocols shared identical definitions of all toxic effects, and that no toxic effect definition was shared by all protocols. Using the Delphi method over three face-to-face plenary meetings, consensus definitions were obtained for all 14 toxic effects. In the overall assessment of outcome of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment, these expert opinion-based definitions will allow reliable comparisons of frequencies and severities of acute toxic effects across treatment protocols, and facilitate international research on cause, guidelines for treatment adaptation, preventive strategies, and development of consensus algorithms for reporting on acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment.","['Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Barzilai, Shlomit', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Frandsen, Thomas Leth', 'Halsey, Christina', 'Hough, Rachael', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Kato, Motohiro', 'Liang, Der-Cherng', 'Mikkelsen, Torben Stamm', 'Moricke, Anja', 'Niinimaki, Riitta', 'Piette, Caroline', 'Putti, Maria Caterina', 'Raetz, Elizabeth', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Skinner, Roderick', 'Tuckuviene, Ruta', 'van der Sluis, Inge', 'Zapotocka, Ester']","['Schmiegelow K', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Barzilai S', 'Escherich G', 'Frandsen TL', 'Halsey C', 'Hough R', 'Jeha S', 'Kato M', 'Liang DC', 'Mikkelsen TS', 'Moricke A', 'Niinimaki R', 'Piette C', 'Putti MC', 'Raetz E', 'Silverman LB', 'Skinner R', 'Tuckuviene R', 'van der Sluis I', 'Zapotocka E']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark; Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; Department of Pediatric Oncology, Langone Medical Center, New York University, New York, NY, USA.

Flow cytometric-based studies have suggested prognostic implications of FXIIIa expression, especially within the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) subgroup of acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, its prognostic correlate by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is unknown. The aims of this study were to (1) define the clinicopathologic features of FXIIIa IHC-positive AML and (2) compare APL with other AML subtypes. Eighty-seven bone marrow biopsies or clot/particle preparations from our institution were evaluated with FXIIIa IHC. The study cohort consisted of bone marrow evaluations of 36 consecutive pretherapy APL, 42 selected pretherapy non-APL AML, and 9 negative staging cases. FXIIIa IHC expression was correlated with clinical and pathologic features and overall survival (OS). Leukemic blast FXIIIa cytoplasmic positivity was noted in 56% (20/36) APL and 74% (31/42) non-APL AML (P=0.10). FXIIIa IHC expression was associated with inferior OS within the APL cohort (P=0.04). No OS differences were noted in comparing FXIIIa IHC expression in all AML (P=0.17), or FXIIIa IHC expression within favorable, intermediate or adverse cytogenetic groups (P=0.14, 0.22 and 0.87, respectively). FXIIIa IHC expression is observed among a broad spectrum of AML subtypes and is not characterized by specific pathologic features. However, within the APL subgroup, FXIIIa IHC expression is associated with an inferior outcome and may be useful for additional prognostic risk stratification.","['Raval, Jay S', 'Berg, Aaron N', 'Djokic, Miroslav', 'Roth, Christine G', 'Rollins-Raval, Marian A']","['Raval JS', 'Berg AN', 'Djokic M', 'Roth CG', 'Rollins-Raval MA']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['104641-95-4 (factor XIII subunit A)', '9013-56-3 (Factor XIII)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Factor XIII/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prognosis']",,,2016/06/15 06:00,2019/02/09 06:00,['2016/06/15 06:00'],"['2016/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000404 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2018 Mar;26(3):202-205. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000404.,10.1097/PAI.0000000000000404 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Grouping qRT-PCR levels as </=0.01, 0.01 to 0.1, 0.1 to 1, 1 to 10, and >10%, and reporting MFC (sensitivity, 0.1%-0.01%) as positive or negative, kappa coefficient test showed no agreement between qRT-PCR and MFC in BM samples obtained postinduction (n = 44, kappa = 0.041), and only weak agreement during consolidation (n = 108, kappa = 0.083), maintenance/follow-up (n = 107, kappa = 0.164), and salvage chemotherapy (n = 24, 0.376). In the post induction BM samples, while qRT-PCR <0.1% was associated with lower and >/=10% with higher AML relapse risk (P = .035), qRT-PCR between 0.1% to 1% and 1% to 10% failed to predict relapse.

Analysis of clinical and molecular features.,1211-21,"BCR-ABL-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare subtype of AML that is now included as a provisional entity in the 2016 revised WHO classification of myeloid malignancies. Since a clear distinction between de novo BCR-ABL+ AML and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis is challenging in many cases, the existence of de novo BCR-ABL+ AML has been a matter of debate for a long time. However, there is increasing evidence suggesting that BCR-ABL+ AML is in fact a distinct subgroup of AML. In this study, we analyzed all published cases since 1975 as well as cases from our institution in order to present common clinical and molecular features of this rare disease. Our analysis shows that BCR-ABL predominantly occurs in AML-NOS, CBF leukemia, and AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. The most common BCR-ABL transcripts (p190 and p210) are nearly equally distributed. Based on the analysis of published data, we provide a clinical algorithm for the initial differential diagnosis of BCR-ABL+ AML. The prognosis of BCR-ABL+ AML seems to depend on the cytogenetic and/or molecular background rather than on BCR-ABL itself. A therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib is reasonable, but-due to a lack of systematic clinical data-their use cannot be routinely recommended in first-line therapy. Beyond first-line treatment of AML, the use of TKI remains an individual decision, both in combination with intensive chemotherapy and/or as a bridge to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In each single case, potential benefits have to be weighed against potential risks.","['Neuendorff, Nina Rosa', 'Burmeister, Thomas', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Westermann, Jorg']","['Neuendorff NR', 'Burmeister T', 'Dorken B', 'Westermann J']","['Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - University Medicine Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany. nina-rosa.neuendorff@charite.de.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - University Medicine Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Labor Berlin Charite-Vivantes GmbH, Sylter Str. 2, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - University Medicine Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Labor Berlin Charite-Vivantes GmbH, Sylter Str. 2, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Charite - University Medicine Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Labor Berlin Charite-Vivantes GmbH, Sylter Str. 2, 13353, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160614,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Algorithms', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*genetics/therapy', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'World Health Organization', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'BCR-ABL', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2016/06/15 06:00,2017/02/06 06:00,['2016/06/15 06:00'],"['2016/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2721-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2721-z [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Aug;95(8):1211-21. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2721-z.

We generated a humanized immunoglobulin G1 mAb, hz515H7, which binds human CXCR4, efficiently competes for SDF-1 binding, and induces a conformational change in CXCR4 homodimers. Furthermore, it inhibits both CXCR4 receptor-mediated G-protein activation and beta-arrestin-2 recruitment following CXCR4 activation. The binding of the hz515H7 antibody to CXCR4 inhibits the SDF-1-induced signaling pathway, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of downstream effectors, such as Akt, Erk1/2, p38, and GSK3beta. Hz515H7 also strongly inhibits cell migration and proliferation and, while preserving normal blood cells, induces both antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity against neoplastic cells. In mouse xenograft models, hz515H7 displays antitumor activities with multiple hematologic tumor cell lines, with its Fc-mediated effector functions proving essential in this context. Furthermore, hz515H7 binds to primary tumor cells from acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma patients. Collectively, our results demonstrate two major mechanisms of action, making hz515H7 unique in this regard.

Although some patients exhibit deep and durable responses to venetoclax as a single agent, other patients harbor subpopulations of resistant leukemia cells that mediate disease recurrence. One hypothesis for the origin of resistance to venetoclax is by kinase-mediated survival signals encountered in proliferation centers that may be unique for individual patients. An in vitro microenvironment model was developed with primary CLL cells that could be incorporated into an automated high-content microscopy-based screen of kinase inhibitors (KIs) to identify agents that may improve venetoclax therapy in a personalized manner. Marked interpatient variability was noted for which KIs were effective; nevertheless, sunitinib was identified as the most common clinically available KI effective in overcoming venetoclax resistance. Examination of the underlying mechanisms indicated that venetoclax resistance may be induced by microenvironmental signals that upregulate antiapoptotic Bcl-xl, Mcl-1, and A1, which can be counteracted more efficiently by sunitinib than by ibrutinib or idelalisib. Although patient-specific drug responses are common, for many patients, combination therapy with sunitinib may significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of venetoclax.","['Oppermann, Sina', 'Ylanko, Jarkko', 'Shi, Yonghong', 'Hariharan, Santosh', 'Oakes, Christopher C', 'Brauer, Patrick M', 'Zuniga-Pflucker, Juan C', 'Leber, Brian', 'Spaner, David E', 'Andrews, David W']","['Oppermann S', 'Ylanko J', 'Shi Y', 'Hariharan S', 'Oakes CC', 'Brauer PM', 'Zuniga-Pflucker JC', 'Leber B', 'Spaner DE', 'Andrews DW']","['Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada;', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada;', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada;', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH;', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada;', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada;', 'Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada;', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Center, Toronto, ON, Canada; and Department of Medical Biophysics and.', 'Biology Platform, Sunnybrook Research Institute, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Center, Toronto, ON, Canada; and Department of Medical Biophysics and Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160613,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cellular Microenvironment/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*analysis/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/pharmacology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Sunitinib', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,,2016/06/15 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/06/15 06:00'],"['2015/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34234-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-12-687814 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Aug 18;128(7):934-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-12-687814.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis that included allograft recipients with accelerated phase and blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia or Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia who had received post-transplant maintenance TKI therapy from 2004 to 2014. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients, 9 with accelerated phase/blast phase CML and 17 with Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia, received maintenance post-transplant therapy with imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or ponatinib. The TKI was selected according to the pretransplantation TKI response, anticipated toxicities, and ABL1 domain mutations, when present. Newer generation TKIs were initiated at a >/= 50% dose reduction from the standard pretransplantation dosing to limit the toxicities and avoid therapy interruptions. TKIs were started a median of 100 days (range, 28-238 days) after transplantation and were administered for a median of 16 months (range, 8 days to 105 months). Eight patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events. With a median follow-up of 3.6 years (range, 4 months to 8.7 years), the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 61%. All 3 patients who developed a relapse underwent successful salvage treatment and remained disease-free. The 5-year overall survival rate was 78%. CONCLUSION: Maintenance TKI therapy after transplantation is feasible and might reduce the incidence of relapses and improve outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for patients with high-risk Ph(+) leukemia.","['DeFilipp, Zachariah', 'Langston, Amelia A', 'Chen, Zhengjia', 'Zhang, Chao', 'Arellano, Martha L', 'El Rassi, Fuad', 'Flowers, Christopher R', 'Kota, Vamsi K', 'Al-Kadhimi, Zaid', 'Veldman, Rachel', 'Jillella, Anand P', 'Lonial, Sagar', 'Waller, Edmund K', 'Khoury, Hanna J']","['DeFilipp Z', 'Langston AA', 'Chen Z', 'Zhang C', 'Arellano ML', 'El Rassi F', 'Flowers CR', 'Kota VK', 'Al-Kadhimi Z', 'Veldman R', 'Jillella AP', 'Lonial S', 'Waller EK', 'Khoury HJ']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, GA.

Here we show that NKX2-3 is overexpressed in tumour cells from a subset of patients with marginal-zone lymphomas, but not with other B-cell malignancies. While Nkx2-3-deficient mice exhibit the absence of marginal-zone B cells, transgenic mice with expression of NKX2-3 in B cells show marginal-zone expansion that leads to the development of tumours, faithfully recapitulating the principal clinical and biological features of human marginal-zone lymphomas. NKX2-3 induces B-cell receptor signalling by phosphorylating Lyn/Syk kinases, which in turn activate multiple integrins (LFA-1, VLA-4), adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, MadCAM-1) and the chemokine receptor CXCR4. These molecules enhance migration, polarization and homing of B cells to splenic and extranodal tissues, eventually driving malignant transformation through triggering NF-kappaB and PI3K-AKT pathways. This study implicates oncogenic NKX2-3 in lymphomagenesis, and provides a valid experimental mouse model for studying the biology and therapy of human marginal-zone B-cell lymphomas.","['Robles, Eloy F', 'Mena-Varas, Maria', 'Barrio, Laura', 'Merino-Cortes, Sara V', 'Balogh, Peter', 'Du, Ming-Qing', 'Akasaka, Takashi', 'Parker, Anton', 'Roa, Sergio', 'Panizo, Carlos', 'Martin-Guerrero, Idoia', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Segura, Victor', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Macri-Pellizeri, Laura', 'Aldaz, Beatriz', 'Vilas-Zornoza, Amaia', 'Zhang, Shaowei', 'Moody, Sarah', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose', 'Tousseyn, Thomas', 'Broccardo, Cyril', 'Brousset, Pierre', 'Campos-Sanchez, Elena', 'Cobaleda, Cesar', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Isidro', 'Fernandez-Luna, Jose Luis', 'Garcia-Munoz, Ricardo', 'Pena, Esther', 'Bellosillo, Beatriz', 'Salar, Antonio', 'Baptista, Maria Joao', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus Maria', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Terol, Maria Jose', 'Climent, Joan', 'Ferrandez, Antonio', 'Sagaert, Xavier', 'Melnick, Ari M', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Oscier, David G', 'Carrasco, Yolanda R', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Martinez-Climent, Jose A']","['Robles EF', 'Mena-Varas M', 'Barrio L', 'Merino-Cortes SV', 'Balogh P', 'Du MQ', 'Akasaka T', 'Parker A', 'Roa S', 'Panizo C', 'Martin-Guerrero I', 'Siebert R', 'Segura V', 'Agirre X', 'Macri-Pellizeri L', 'Aldaz B', 'Vilas-Zornoza A', 'Zhang S', 'Moody S', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Tousseyn T', 'Broccardo C', 'Brousset P', 'Campos-Sanchez E', 'Cobaleda C', 'Sanchez-Garcia I', 'Fernandez-Luna JL', 'Garcia-Munoz R', 'Pena E', 'Bellosillo B', 'Salar A', 'Baptista MJ', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Gonzalez M', 'Terol MJ', 'Climent J', 'Ferrandez A', 'Sagaert X', 'Melnick AM', 'Prosper F', 'Oscier DG', 'Carrasco YR', 'Dyer MJ', 'Martinez-Climent JA']","['Division of Hemato-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research CIMA, University of Navarra, IDISNA, Pamplona 31008, Spain.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research CIMA, University of Navarra, IDISNA, Pamplona 31008, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology and Oncology, Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia (CNB)-CSIC, Madrid 28049, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology and Oncology, Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia (CNB)-CSIC, Madrid 28049, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology and Biotechnology, Szentagothai Research Center, University of Pecs, Pecs H-7624, Hungary.', 'Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, Cambridge University, Cambridge CB2 1QP, UK.', 'MRC Toxicology Unit and Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, Department of Cancer Studies and Molecular Medicine, University of Leicester, Leicester LE2 7LX, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth BH7 7DW, UK.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research CIMA, University of Navarra, IDISNA, Pamplona 31008, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Clinica Universidad de Navarra, IDISNA, Pamplona 31008, Spain.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel &University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel 24105, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel &University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel 24105, Germany.', 'Bio-informatic Unit, Department of Genomics and Proteomics, Center for Applied Medical Research CIMA, University of Navarra, IDISNA, Pamplona 31008, Spain.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research CIMA, University of Navarra, IDISNA, Pamplona 31008, Spain.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research CIMA, University of Navarra, IDISNA, Pamplona 31008, Spain.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research CIMA, University of Navarra, IDISNA, Pamplona 31008, Spain.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research CIMA, University of Navarra, IDISNA, Pamplona 31008, Spain.', 'Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, Cambridge University, Cambridge CB2 1QP, UK.', 'Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, Cambridge University, Cambridge CB2 1QP, UK.', 'Department of Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Navarra, IDISNA, Pamplona 31008, Spain.', 'Centre for Translation Cell and Tissue Research, KU Leuven, Leuven 3000, Belgium.', 'Department of Pathology, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, Labex TOUCAN and CRCT INSERM U1037, Toulouse F-31053, France.', 'Department of Pathology, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, Labex TOUCAN and CRCT INSERM U1037, Toulouse F-31053, France.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC/Universidad Autonoma, Madrid 28049, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC/Universidad Autonoma, Madrid 28049, Spain.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Cancer, CSIC/University of Salamanca;

We have reported earlier that MEF2C, a target of miR-223, was significantly up regulated in CML and also showed a negative correlation with miR-223. In this study, gene expression arrays were used to identify the genes regulated by MEF2C during myelopoiesis. Statistical tools were used to understand the correlation between MEF2C and the targets in different phases of CML. Different CML cell lines and CML patient samples were treated with imatinib to study the effect of MEF2C on the target genes. We observed that MEF2C targets a set of myeloid genes including the myeloid transcription factor CEBPA. MEF2C and CEBPA expression patterns are negatively correlated in CML patient samples. We further show that the expression of MEF2C and CEBPA along with CSF3R is sufficient to molecularly classify different stages of CML. Imatinib, the drug of choice for CML, abrogates MEF2C expression and reverses CEBPA repression both in the cell line and the primary cells.

Human leukemia cell line HL-60 were treated with increasing doses of etoposide (ETP) (0.5; 0.75; 1muM) to investigate how the drug affects cell morphology, viability, cell cycle distribution and expression of cyclin B1. To achieve this aim we applied light and transmission electron microscopy to observe morphological and ultra structural changes, image-based cytometry for apoptosis evaluation and cell cycle analysis, and then we conducted immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining to visualize cyclin localization and expression. Quantitive data about cyclin B1 expression were obtained from flow cytometry. Etoposide caused decrease in cell viability, induced apoptosis and G2/M arrest accompanied by enhanced expression of cyclin B1. Changes in expression and localization of cyclin B1 may constitute a part of the mechanism responsible for resistance of HL-60 cells to etoposide.

In the present study, we aimed to explore the role of TLE4 in tumorigenesis and cancer progression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: The expression pattern of TLE4 in HCC was determined by Western-blot and qRT-PCR, gain-of-function and loss-of-function was used to explore the biological role of TLE4 in HCC cells. A xenograft model was established to confirm its effects on proliferation. RESULTS: The protein expression levels of TLE4 were significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues compared to matched adjacent normal liver tissues. In vitro, down-regulation of TLE4 in Huh7 or SMMC-7721 promoted cell proliferation and ectopical expression of TLE4 in Hep3B or Bel-7404 suppressed cell proliferation. In addition, the cell colony formation ability was enhanced after down-regulation of TLE4 expression in Huh-7 but suppressed after over-expression in Hep3B. Furthermore, down-regulation of TLE4 increased the cell invasion ability, as well as increased the expression level of Vimentin and decreased that of E-cadherin, indicating a phenotype of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC cells. On the contrary, ectopical expression of TLE4 in HCC cells decreased the cell invasion ability and inhibited EMT. In vivo, compared to control group, xenograft tumor volumes were significantly decreased in TLE4 overexpression group. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that TLE4 might play important regulatory roles in cellular proliferation and EMT process in HCC.","['Wu, Xiao-Cai', 'Xiao, Cui-Cui', 'Li, Hua', 'Tai, Yan', 'Zhang, Qi', 'Yang, Yang']","['Wu XC', 'Xiao CC', 'Li H', 'Tai Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Yang Y']","['Department of Hepatic Surgery, 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Liver Disease Research, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hepatic Surgery, 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Liver Disease Research, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hepatic Surgery, 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Liver Disease Research, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Liver Disease Research, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Liver Disease Research, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hepatic Surgery, 3rd Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.

MicroRNAs have been extensively investigated as critical regulators of hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, and they represent a promising strategy for AML therapy. In this study, we identified miR-34b as a novel regulator in myeloid proliferation and apoptosis of leukemic cells. We found that miR-34b was developmentally upregulated in plasma and myeloid cells of healthy subjects, while it was significantly reduced in blood samples of patients with AML and AML cell lines. Moreover, the miR-34b mimicked transfection-mediated restoration of miR-34b inhibited cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis of HL-60 and OCI-AML3 cell lines. Using a miRNA predicting algorithm miRanda, we selected a potent target heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) since that is a master regulator of the heat shock response and is associated with cancer aggressiveness and dissemination. In contrast to the level of miR-34b, HSF1 was highly expressed in blood samples of patients with AML and AML cell lines. The luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-34b directly targeted the HSF1 gene. HSF1 silencing exhibited comparable inhibitory effects on AML cell proliferation and survival. The upregulated HSF1 elevated the activation of the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway. In conclusion, miR-34b suppressed AML cell proliferation and survival by targeting HSF1, in turn leading to the inactivation of Wnt-beta-catenin pathway, which may highlight a new therapeutic approach for AML.","['Li, Gangcan', 'Song, Yanping', 'Zhang, Yunjie', 'Wang, Hao', 'Xie, Jia']","['Li G', 'Song Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang H', 'Xie J']","[""Institute of Hematopathy, Xi'an Central Hospital, Xian, Shaanxi, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSF1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*RNA Interference', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway']",,,2016/06/15 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2016/06/15 06:00'],"['2016/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3727/096504016X14611963142254 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2016;24(2):109-16. doi: 10.3727/096504016X14611963142254.,10.3727/096504016X14611963142254 [doi],,PMC7838633,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we conducted a nationwide population-based study in Taiwan to reveal the cancer risk in patients with IBD. METHODS: Using the national health database of Taiwan, we identified 3,348 IBD patients without previous cancer, including 685 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 2,663 with ulcerative colitis (UC), as a cohort from 1998 to 2012 and followed them up until 2013. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of overall and site-specific cancers in CD and UC patients in comparison with the general population were analyzed. RESULTS: Regarding overall cancer risk analysis, both CD (SIR 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9-2.1) and UC (SIR 0.93, 95% CI 0.7-1.1) patients did not have a higher risk. In site-specific cancer risk analysis, CD (SIR 14.08, P<0.01) and UC (SIR 2.51, P=0.02) patients had a higher risk of hematological malignancies. The risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) did not increase significantly in either CD (SIR 0.96, P=0.7) or UC (SIR 1.39, P=0.22) patients. CONCLUSIONS: This first nationwide population-based study in Asia reveals a significantly higher risk for hematological malignancies in IBD patients.

ICOS is prominently expressed on T follicular helper (TFH) cells, a specialized CD4(+) T cell subset that orchestrates B cell differentiation within the germinal centers and humoral response. However, the contribution of ICOS and TFH cells to autoantibody profiles under pathological conditions has not been thoroughly investigated. We used the Sle1 lupus-prone mouse model to examine the role of ICOS in the expansion and function of pathogenic TFH cells. Genetic deletion of ICOS impacted the expansion of TFH cells in B6.Sle1 mice and inhibited the differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasma cells. The phenotypic changes observed in B6.Sle1-ICOS-knockout mice were also associated with a significant reduction in class-switched IgG, and anti-nucleosomal IgG-secreting B cells compared with B6.Sle1 animals. The level of vascular cell adhesion protein 1, a molecule that was shown to be elevated in patients with SLE and in lupus models, was also increased in an ICOS-dependent manner in Sle1 mice and correlated with autoantibody levels. The elimination of ICOS-expressing CD4(+) T cells in B6.Sle1 mice, using a glyco-engineered anti-ICOS-depleting Ab, resulted in a significant reduction in anti-nucleosomal autoantibodies. Our results indicate that ICOS regulates the ontogeny and homeostasis of B6.Sle1 TFH cells and influences the function of TFH cells during aberrant germinal center B cell responses. Therapies targeting the ICOS signaling pathway may offer new opportunities for the treatment of lupus and other autoimmune diseases.","['Mittereder, Nanette', 'Kuta, Ellen', 'Bhat, Geetha', 'Dacosta, Karma', 'Cheng, Lily I', 'Herbst, Ronald', 'Carlesso, Gianluca']","['Mittereder N', 'Kuta E', 'Bhat G', 'Dacosta K', 'Cheng LI', 'Herbst R', 'Carlesso G']","['Department of Respiratory, Inflammation, and Autoimmunity, MedImmune LLC, Gaithersburg, MD 20878; and.', 'Department of Respiratory, Inflammation, and Autoimmunity, MedImmune LLC, Gaithersburg, MD 20878; and.', 'Department of Respiratory, Inflammation, and Autoimmunity, MedImmune LLC, Gaithersburg, MD 20878; and.', 'Department of Pathology, MedImmune LLC, Gaithersburg, MD 20878.', 'Department of Pathology, MedImmune LLC, Gaithersburg, MD 20878.', 'Department of Respiratory, Inflammation, and Autoimmunity, MedImmune LLC, Gaithersburg, MD 20878; and.', 'Department of Respiratory, Inflammation, and Autoimmunity, MedImmune LLC, Gaithersburg, MD 20878; and carlessog@medimmune.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160613,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Icos protein, mouse)', '0 (Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Protein)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Immune Tolerance/*immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Protein/*immunology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*immunology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology']",,,2016/06/15 06:00,2017/08/09 06:00,['2016/06/15 06:00'],"['2015/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1502241 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1502241 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2016 Jul 15;197(2):491-503. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1502241.

The Pbx1-d dominant-negative isoform is more frequent in CD4(+) T cells from lupus patients than from healthy controls. Pbx1-d is associated with the production of autoreactive T cells in mice carrying the Sle1a1 lupus-susceptibility locus. Transgenic (Tg) expression of Pbx1-d in CD4(+) T cells reproduced the phenotypes of Sle1a1 mice, with increased inflammatory functions of CD4(+) T cells and impaired Foxp3(+) regulatory T cell (Treg) homeostasis. Pbx1-d-Tg expression also expanded the number of follicular helper T cells (TFHs) in a cell-intrinsic and Ag-specific manner, which was enhanced in recall responses and resulted in Th1-biased Abs. Moreover, Pbx1-d-Tg CD4(+) T cells upregulated the expression of miR-10a, miR-21, and miR-155, which were implicated in Treg and follicular helper T cell homeostasis. Our results suggest that Pbx1-d impacts lupus development by regulating effector T cell differentiation and promoting TFHs at the expense of Tregs.

However, there are limited data on GLS in this setting, in particular in survivors with apparently normal LV function without risk factors of impaired GLS. In the present study, we measured GLS in 191 adult survivors of childhood lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with normal LV ejection fraction and fractional shortening (FS) and without known hypertension, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, or stroke. We compared GLS in the survivors with 180 controls. Mean GLS was -19.0 +/- 2.2% in the survivor group and -21.4 +/- 2.0% in the controls (p <0.001). Impaired GLS, defined as mean - 1.96 SDs in the control group, occurred in 53 of 191 survivors (28%). We included survivors with impaired LV ejection fraction and/or FS or traditional risk factors (n = 231 in all) in multiple regression analyses to explore associations with previous cancer treatment. Survivors treated with mediastinal radiotherapy had an odds ratio of impaired GLS of 5.2 (95% confidence interval 2.2 to 12) compared with other survivors. Survivors treated with cumulative anthracycline doses >300 mg/m(2) had an odds ratio of 4.8 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 14) of impaired GLS. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a high proportion of LV dysfunction assessed by GLS in apparently healthy adult survivors of childhood cancer. Impaired GLS was associated with previous exposure to mediastinal radiotherapy and high doses of anthracyclines. The prognostic role of measuring GLS in this specific patient population should be examined in prospective studies.","['Christiansen, Jon R', 'Massey, Richard', 'Dalen, Havard', 'Kanellopoulos, Adriani', 'Hamre, Hanne', 'Fossa, Sophie D', 'Ruud, Ellen', 'Kiserud, Cecilie E', 'Aakhus, Svend']","['Christiansen JR', 'Massey R', 'Dalen H', 'Kanellopoulos A', 'Hamre H', 'Fossa SD', 'Ruud E', 'Kiserud CE', 'Aakhus S']","['Department of Cardiology, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway; Department of Medicine, Innlandet Hospital Trust, Elverum, Norway.

This study focuses on adjustment trajectories of children during treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and aims to distinguish subgroups of patients showing different trajectories during active treatment, and to identify sociodemographic, medical, and psychosocial predictors of the distinct adjustment trajectories. METHODS: In a multicenter longitudinal study, 108 parents of a child (response rate 80 %) diagnosed with ALL were assessed during induction treatment (T0), after induction/consolidation treatment (T1), and after end of treatment (T2). Trajectories of child behavioral adjustment (Child Behavior Checklist; CBCL) were tested with latent class growth modeling (LCGM) analyses. RESULTS: For internalizing behavior, a three-trajectory model was found: a group that experienced no problems (60 %), a group that experienced only initial problems (30 %), and a group that experienced chronic problems (10 %). For externalizing behavior, a three-trajectory model was also found: a group that experienced no problems (83 %), a group that experienced chronic problems (12 %), and a group that experienced increasing problems (5 %). Only parenting stress and baseline QoL (cancer related) were found to contribute uniquely to adjustment trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the children (77 %) showed no or transient behavioral problems during the entire treatment as reported by parents. A substantial group (23 %) shows maladaptive trajectories of internalizing behavioral problems and/or externalizing behavioral problems. Screening for risk factors for developing problems might be helpful in early identification of these children.","['Sint Nicolaas, Simone M', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter M', 'van den Bergh, Esther M M', 'Custers, Jose A E', 'Gameiro, Sofia', 'Gemke, Reinoud J B J', 'Verhaak, Chris M']","['Sint Nicolaas SM', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'van den Bergh EM', 'Custers JA', 'Gameiro S', 'Gemke RJ', 'Verhaak CM']","['Department of Medical Psychology 840, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. simone.sintnicolaas@radboudumc.nl.', 'Pediatric Oncology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (SKION), The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Psychology 840, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Cardiff Fertility Studies Research Group, School of Psychology, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales, UK.', 'Pediatrics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Psychology 840, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160614,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Parenting/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*Behavioral adjustment', '*Pediatric oncology', '*Predictors', '*Trajectories']",2016/06/15 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2016/06/15 06:00'],"['2016/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00520-016-3289-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-016-3289-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2016 Nov;24(11):4503-13. doi: 10.1007/s00520-016-3289-9.

A high-frequency mutation in gene envelope endows ALV-J with the potential for cross-species transmission. We wished to ascertain if the ALV-J can spread across species under selection pressure in susceptible and resistant hosts. First, we inoculated (in turn) two susceptible host birds (specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens and turkeys). Then, we inoculated three resistant hosts (pheasants, quails and ducks) to detect the viral shedding, pathologic changes, and genetic evolution of different isolates. We found that pheasants and quails were infected under the selective pressure that accumulates stepwise in different hosts, and that ducks were not infected. Infection rates for SPF chickens and turkeys were 100% (16/16), whereas those for pheasants and quails were 37.5% (6/16) and 11.1% (3/27). Infected hosts showed immune tolerance, and inflammation and tissue damage could be seen in the liver, spleen, kidneys and cardiovascular system. Non-synonymous mutation and synonymous ratio (NS/S) analyses revealed the NS/S in hypervariable region (hr) 2 of pheasants and quails was 2.5. That finding suggested that mutation of isolates in pheasants and quails was induced by selective pressure from the resistant host, and that the hr2 region is a critical domain in cross-species transmission of ALV-J. Sequencing showed that ALV-J isolates from turkeys, pheasants and quails had moved away from the original virus, and were closer to the ALV-J prototype strain HPRS-103. However, the HPRS-103 strain cannot infect pheasants and quails, so further studies are needed.","['Shen, Yanwei', 'He, Menglian', 'Zhang, Ji', 'Zhao, Manda', 'Wang, Guihua', 'Cheng, Ziqiang']","['Shen Y', 'He M', 'Zhang J', 'Zhao M', 'Wang G', 'Cheng Z']",,['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Bing Du Xue Bao,Bing du xue bao = Chinese journal of virology,8803009,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*transmission/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/genetics/*physiology', 'Chickens', 'Ducks/virology', 'Galliformes/virology', 'Host Specificity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Poultry Diseases/*transmission/*virology', 'Quail/virology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Turkeys/virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/06/15 06:00,2016/07/01 06:00,['2016/06/15 06:00'],"['2016/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Bing Du Xue Bao. 2016 Jan;32(1):46-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article explores the existence of different psychological well-being (PWB) profiles and verifies their relationship with life satisfaction, resilience, and mental adjustment among Italian YA survivors of childhood leukemia or lymphoma and their own SIBs. METHODS: YA SCCs (n = 35) who had been off primary treatment for at least 5 years and their SIBs (n = 47) completed anonymous self-report questionnaires for PWB, life satisfaction, resilience, and mental adjustment. The survivors at the time of the survey had an average age of 27 years (SD 3.37) and they were an average age of 12 years (SD 1.93) at diagnosis. Their own SIBs had an average age of 29 years (SD +/-5.25). RESULTS: No significant differences were found between SCCs and their SIBs in all considered dimensions. Only 12% of the sample showed evidence of clinically significant mental health disorders, 51% manifested medium levels of resilience, and 49% fit a functional PWB profile. By means of cluster analysis, three PWB statuses could be derived: self-devaluing (25.5%), fatalist (25.5%), and eudaimonic (49%). Each of these PWB statuses exhibited a significant distinct profile in terms of life satisfaction, resilience, and mental adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to establish psychosocial services that offer follow-up examinations aimed to not only prevent mental disorders but also to promote PWB.","['Scrignaro, Marta', 'Nichelli, Francesca', 'Cattaneo, Laura', 'Spinelli, Marco', 'Magrin, Maria Elena', 'Fraschini, Donatella', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Jankovic, Momcilo']","['Scrignaro M', 'Nichelli F', 'Cattaneo L', 'Spinelli M', 'Magrin ME', 'Fraschini D', 'Biondi A', 'Jankovic M']","['1 Department of Psychology, University of Milano-Bicocca , Milan, Italy .', '2 Psychosocial Service, Pediatric Clinic, MBBM Foundation, Maria Letizia Verga Center , Monza, Italy .', '3 Pediatric Clinic, MBBM Foundation, Maria Letizia Verga Center , Monza, Italy .', '3 Pediatric Clinic, MBBM Foundation, Maria Letizia Verga Center , Monza, Italy .', '1 Department of Psychology, University of Milano-Bicocca , Milan, Italy .', '3 Pediatric Clinic, MBBM Foundation, Maria Letizia Verga Center , Monza, Italy .', '3 Pediatric Clinic, MBBM Foundation, Maria Letizia Verga Center , Monza, Italy .', '3 Pediatric Clinic, MBBM Foundation, Maria Letizia Verga Center , Monza, Italy .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160613,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/mortality/psychology', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Siblings', 'Social Support', 'Survivors', 'Survivorship']",['NOTNLM'],"['*quality of life', '*social support', '*survivorship']",2016/06/14 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2016/06/14 06:00'],"['2016/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2016.0005 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2016 Dec;5(4):330-336. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2016.0005.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of vascular events in patients with CML treated with first- and second-generation TKIs. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using nationwide population-based registries. SETTING: Sweden. PATIENTS: All patients diagnosed with chronic-phase CML in Sweden from 2002 to 2012 and treated with a TKI, and 5 age- and sex-matched control individuals per patient. MEASUREMENTS: Relative risks, expressed as incidence rate ratios comparing patients with control individuals, were calculated. Events per 1000 person-years were assessed in interdrug comparisons. RESULTS: 896 patients, 94.4% with documented TKI treatment, were followed for a median of 4.2 years. There were 54 arterial and 20 venous events in the CML cohort, corresponding to relative risks of 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1 to 2.1) and 2.0 (CI, 1.2 to 3.3), respectively. The event rate for myocardial infarction was higher in patients treated with nilotinib or dasatinib (29 and 19 per 1000 person-years, respectively) than in those receiving imatinib (8 per 1000 person-years), although data are limited and the CIs were wide and overlapped. Among 31 patients treated with a TKI who had myocardial infarction, 26 (84%) had at least 1 major cardiac risk factor diagnosed before the event occurred. LIMITATIONS: Patients may have been exposed to multiple TKIs. Data on second- and third-generation TKIs were limited. CONCLUSION: An increased risk for arterial and venous vascular events was seen in patients with CML treated with a TKI. Further study is needed to determine whether the risk for myocardial infarction increases with second-generation drugs.

PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) plays a key role in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and function and in the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy. Here, using embryonic fibroblasts fromPINK1 gene-knockout (KO) mice, we evaluated whether mitophagy is a causal mechanism for the control of cell-fate plasticity and maintenance of pluripotency. Loss of PINK1-dependent mitophagy was sufficient to dramatically decrease the speed and efficiency of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming. Mitophagy-deficient iPSC colonies, which were characterized by a mixture of mature and immature mitochondria, seemed unstable, with a strong tendency to spontaneously differentiate and form heterogeneous populations of cells. Although mitophagy-deficient iPSC colonies normally expressed pluripotent markers, functional monitoring of cellular bioenergetics revealed an attenuated glycolysis in mitophagy-deficient iPSC cells. Targeted metabolomics showed a notable alteration in numerous glycolysis- and TCA-related metabolites in mitophagy-deficient iPSC cells, including a significant decrease in the intracellular levels of alpha-ketoglutarate -a key suppressor of the differentiation path in stem cells. Mitophagy-deficient iPSC colonies exhibited a notably reduced teratoma-initiating capacity, but fully retained their pluripotency and multi-germ layer differentiation capacity in vivo. PINK1-dependent mitophagy pathway is an important mitochondrial switch that determines the efficiency and quality of somatic reprogramming. Mitophagy-driven mitochondrial rejuvenation might contribute to the ability of iPSCs to suppress differentiation by directing bioenergetic transition and metabolome remodeling traits. These findings provide new insights into how mitophagy might influence the stem cell decisions to retain pluripotency or differentiate in tissue regeneration and aging, tumor growth, and regenerative medicine.","['Vazquez-Martin, Alejandro', 'Van den Haute, Chris', 'Cufi, Silvia', 'Corominas-Faja, Bruna', 'Cuyas, Elisabet', 'Lopez-Bonet, Eugeni', 'Rodriguez-Gallego, Esther', 'Fernandez-Arroyo, Salvador', 'Joven, Jorge', 'Baekelandt, Veerle', 'Menendez, Javier A']","['Vazquez-Martin A', 'Van den Haute C', 'Cufi S', 'Corominas-Faja B', 'Cuyas E', 'Lopez-Bonet E', 'Rodriguez-Gallego E', 'Fernandez-Arroyo S', 'Joven J', 'Baekelandt V', 'Menendez JA']","['Cancer Research Group, Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, Riga, Latvia.', 'Laboratory for Neurobiology and Gene Therapy, Department of Neurosciences, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Flanders, Belgium.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Stem Cell Lab, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Girona Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBGI), Girona, Spain.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Girona Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBGI), Girona, Spain.', 'Department of Anatomical Pathology, Dr. Josep Trueta Hospital of Girona, Girona, Catalonia, Spain.', ""Unitat de Recerca Biomedica, Hospital Universitari Sant Joan, Institut d'Investigacio Sanitaria Pere Virgili (IISPV), Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Reus, Spain."", ""Unitat de Recerca Biomedica, Hospital Universitari Sant Joan, Institut d'Investigacio Sanitaria Pere Virgili (IISPV), Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Reus, Spain."", ""Unitat de Recerca Biomedica, Hospital Universitari Sant Joan, Institut d'Investigacio Sanitaria Pere Virgili (IISPV), Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Reus, Spain."", 'Laboratory for Neurobiology and Gene Therapy, Department of Neurosciences, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Flanders, Belgium.', 'Molecular Oncology Group, Girona Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBGI), Girona, Spain.', 'ProCURE (Program Against Cancer Therapeutic Resistance), Metabolism and Cancer Group, Catalan Institute of Oncology, Girona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,"['EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Lineage/*physiology', 'Cellular Reprogramming/physiology', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Metabolomics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mitophagy/*physiology', 'Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*epigenetics', '*mitochondria', '*mitophagy', '*pluripotency', '*stem cells']",2016/06/14 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/06/14 06:00'],"['2016/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['100976 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.100976 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2016 Jul;8(7):1330-52. doi: 10.18632/aging.100976.,10.18632/aging.100976 [doi],,PMC4993334,"['statement The authors confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest', 'associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial', 'support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.

Previous studies have revealed that defective BRCA1 may lead to elevated telomere fusions and accelerated telomere shortening. In addition, BRCA1 associates with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies in alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALTs) positive cells. We report here elevated recombination rates at telomeres in cells from human BRCA1 mutation carriers and in mouse embryonic stem cells lacking both copies of functional Brca1. An increased recombination rate at telomeres is one of the signs of ALT. To investigate this possibility further we employed the C-circle assay that identifies ALT unequivocally. Our results revealed elevated levels of ALT activity in Brca1 defective mouse cells. Similar results were obtained when the same cells were assayed for the presence of another ALT marker, namely the frequency of PML bodies. These results suggest that BRCA1 may act as a repressor of ALT.

The analysis of SHM has offered critical insight into the physiology and pathology of B cells, leading to strong prognostication markers for clinical outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the most frequent adult B-cell malignancy. In this paper we present a methodology for integrating multiple immunogenetic and clinocobiological data sources in order to extract features and create high quality datasets for SHM analysis in IG receptors of CLL patients. This dataset is used as the basis for a higher level integration procedure, inspired form social choice theory. This is applied in the Towards Analysis, our attempt to investigate the potential ontogenetic transformation of genes belonging to specific stereotyped CLL subsets towards other genes or gene families, through SHM. RESULTS: The data integration process, followed by feature extraction, resulted in the generation of a dataset containing information about mutations occurring through SHM. The Towards analysis performed on the integrated dataset applying voting techniques, revealed the distinct behaviour of subset #201 compared to other subsets, as regards SHM related movements among gene clans, both in allele-conserved and non-conserved gene areas. With respect to movement between genes, a high percentage movement towards pseudo genes was found in all CLL subsets. CONCLUSIONS: This data integration and feature extraction process can set the basis for exploratory analysis or a fully automated computational data mining approach on many as yet unanswered, clinically relevant biological questions.","['Kavakiotis, Ioannis', 'Xochelli, Aliki', 'Agathangelidis, Andreas', 'Tsoumakas, Grigorios', 'Maglaveras, Nicos', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Hadzidimitriou, Anastasia', 'Vlahavas, Ioannis', 'Chouvarda, Ioanna']","['Kavakiotis I', 'Xochelli A', 'Agathangelidis A', 'Tsoumakas G', 'Maglaveras N', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Hadzidimitriou A', 'Vlahavas I', 'Chouvarda I']","['Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece. ikavak@csd.auth.gr.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology and Department of Onco-Hematology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Lab of Computing and Medical Informatics, Medical School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Lab of Computing and Medical Informatics, Medical School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160606,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Female', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Immunogenetics/*methods', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'Data integration', 'Feature extraction', 'List aggregation', 'Mutation patterns, somatic hypermutation', 'SHM']",2016/06/15 06:00,2017/08/18 06:00,['2016/06/14 06:00'],"['2016/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-016-1044-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-016-1044-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2016 Jun 6;17 Suppl 5:173. doi: 10.1186/s12859-016-1044-3.,10.1186/s12859-016-1044-3 [doi],,PMC4905615,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A review from the ALWP of the EBMT.,1431-1438,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains the therapeutic method with the most potent anti-leukemic activity mediated by the graft versus leukemia effect. However, a significant proportion of patients with AML will relapse after allo-SCT. The prognosis for these patients is dismal, with a probability of long-term survival of <20%. Data from previous studies have shown that disease-specific prognostic factors, are in general, the same as those in patients treated with conventional chemotherapy. Minimal residual disease (MRD) and chimerism status monitoring after allo-SCT may be used as predictors of impending relapse and should be part of routine follow-up for AML patients. A significant number of studies have shown that pre-emptive administration of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) based on MRD and chimerism monitoring, as well as prophylactic DLI in AML patients at high risk of relapse is effective in preventing relapse. In this review, we discuss strategies for the identification of high-risk patients, review current therapeutic options and provide our recommendations for the management of post-SCT AML.","['Tsirigotis, P', 'Byrne, M', 'Schmid, C', 'Baron, F', 'Ciceri, F', 'Esteve, J', 'Gorin, N C', 'Giebel, S', 'Mohty, M', 'Savani, B N', 'Nagler, A']","['Tsirigotis P', 'Byrne M', 'Schmid C', 'Baron F', 'Ciceri F', 'Esteve J', 'Gorin NC', 'Giebel S', 'Mohty M', 'Savani BN', 'Nagler A']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, ATTIKON University Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Section, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Klinikum Augsburg, Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Munich, Augsburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Hematology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, University Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Saint Antoine Hospital, APHP and University UPMC, Paris, France.', 'Maria Sklodowska-Curie Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland.', 'Department of Haematology, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Section, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160613,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Chimerism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Recurrence', 'Secondary Prevention']",,,2016/11/03 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2016/06/14 06:00'],"['2016/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2016167 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2016.167 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2016 Nov;51(11):1431-1438. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2016.167.

For decades, age alone had been widely used as the primary criterion to assess eligibility for allogeneic SCT; however, prospective studies to evaluate allogeneic SCT in elderly patients are still limited. A total of 187 patients (median age of 64 years, range 60-77 years) with AML (87%) or MDS (13%) transplanted between 1999 and 2014 were included in this retrospective analysis. Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) at 3 years were 32% (95% confidence interval (CI): 25-39%) and 35% (95%CI: 27-42%), respectively. Overall survival was 49% (95%CI: 35-64%) in AML patients who were transplanted in first complete remission (CR1), but even patients with active disease did benefit from transplantation, showing an OS at 3 years of 30% (95%CI: 20-40%). Multivariate analysis revealed disease- and patient-specific risk indices as independent prognostic factors for OS and non-relapse mortality (NRM). In conclusion, our monocenter results indicate that patients should not be generally withheld from allogeneic SCT because of age or disease status only. Specific risk models incorporating disease status and disease-specific risk factors at the time of transplantation as well as existing comorbidities are helpful tools to assess transplantation-associated risk factors of elderly patients.","['Pohlen, M', 'Groth, C', 'Sauer, T', 'Gorlich, D', 'Mesters, R', 'Schliemann, C', 'Lenz, G', 'Muller-Tidow, C', 'Buchner, T', 'Berdel, W E', 'Stelljes, M']","['Pohlen M', 'Groth C', 'Sauer T', 'Gorlich D', 'Mesters R', 'Schliemann C', 'Lenz G', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Buchner T', 'Berdel WE', 'Stelljes M']","['Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Translational Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Cluster of Excellence EXC 1003, Cells in Motion, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine IV, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Halle, Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A/Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160613,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/11/03 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2016/06/14 06:00'],"['2016/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2016156 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2016.156 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2016 Nov;51(11):1441-1448. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2016.156.

Here we performed an RNA interference screen to delineate gene regulatory networks that mediate LEN responsiveness in an MDS cell line, MDSL. We identified GPR68, which encodes a G-protein-coupled receptor that has been implicated in calcium metabolism, as the top candidate gene for modulating sensitivity to LEN. LEN induced GPR68 expression via IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1), resulting in increased cytosolic calcium levels and activation of a calcium-dependent calpain, CAPN1, which were requisite steps for induction of apoptosis in MDS cells and in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. In contrast, deletion of GPR68 or inhibition of calcium and calpain activation suppressed LEN-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, expression of calpastatin (CAST), an endogenous CAPN1 inhibitor that is encoded by a gene (CAST) deleted in del(5q) MDS, correlated with LEN responsiveness in patients with del(5q) MDS. Depletion of CAST restored responsiveness of LEN-resistant non-del(5q) MDS cells and AML cells, providing an explanation for the superior responses of patients with del(5q) MDS to LEN treatment. Our study describes a cellular mechanism by which LEN, acting through CRBN and IKZF1, has cytotoxic effects in MDS and AML that depend on a calcium- and calpain-dependent pathway.","['Fang, Jing', 'Liu, Xiaona', 'Bolanos, Lyndsey', 'Barker, Brenden', 'Rigolino, Carmela', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Oliva, Esther N', 'Cuzzola, Maria', 'Grimes, H Leighton', 'Fontanillo, Celia', 'Komurov, Kakajan', 'MacBeth, Kyle', 'Starczynowski, Daniel T']","['Fang J', 'Liu X', 'Bolanos L', 'Barker B', 'Rigolino C', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Oliva EN', 'Cuzzola M', 'Grimes HL', 'Fontanillo C', 'Komurov K', 'MacBeth K', 'Starczynowski DT']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", 'Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Bianchi Melacrino Morelli, Reggio Calabria, Italy.', ""Department of Hematology, Fondazione Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."", 'Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Bianchi Melacrino Morelli, Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Bianchi Melacrino Morelli, Reggio Calabria, Italy.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", 'Celgene Corporation, Seville, Spain.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", 'Celgene Corporation, San Francisco, California, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160613,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRBN protein, human)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GPR68 protein, human)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', '79079-11-1 (calpastatin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.52 (CAPN1 protein, human)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Calpain/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,,2016/06/14 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2016/06/14 06:00'],"['2016/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.4127 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.4127 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2016 Jul;22(7):727-34. doi: 10.1038/nm.4127.

However, the mechanisms by which BRD4 and DOT1L regulate leukemogenic transcription programs remain unclear. Using quantitative proteomics, chemoproteomics and biochemical fractionation, we found that native BRD4 and DOT1L exist in separate protein complexes. Genetic disruption or small-molecule inhibition of BRD4 and DOT1L showed marked synergistic activity against MLL leukemia cell lines, primary human leukemia cells and mouse leukemia models. Mechanistically, we found a previously unrecognized functional collaboration between DOT1L and BRD4 that is especially important at highly transcribed genes in proximity to superenhancers. DOT1L, via dimethylated histone H3 K79, facilitates histone H4 acetylation, which in turn regulates the binding of BRD4 to chromatin. These data provide new insights into the regulation of transcription and specify a molecular framework for therapeutic intervention in this disease with poor prognosis.","['Gilan, Omer', 'Lam, Enid Y

We examined the association between maternal intake of these nutrients before pregnancy and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a matched case-control study. METHODS: Maternal dietary intake and vitamin supplement use in the year before pregnancy was assessed by food frequency questionnaire for 681 ALL cases, 103 AML cases, and 1076 controls. Principal component analysis was used to construct a variable representing combined nutrient intake, and conditional logistic regression estimated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association of ALL and AML with the principal component and each nutrient. RESULTS: Higher maternal intake of one-carbon metabolism nutrients from food and supplements combined was associated with reduced risk of ALL (OR for one-unit change in the principal component = 0.91, CI 0.84-0.99) and possibly AML (OR for the principal component = 0.83, CI 0.66-1.04). When analyzed separately, intake of supplements high in these nutrients was associated with a reduced risk of ALL in children of Hispanic women only. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, these data suggest that higher maternal intake of one-carbon metabolism nutrients may reduce risk of childhood leukemia.","['Singer, Amanda W', 'Selvin, Steve', 'Block, Gladys', 'Golden, Carla', 'Carmichael, Suzan L', 'Metayer, Catherine']","['Singer AW', 'Selvin S', 'Block G', 'Golden C', 'Carmichael SL', 'Metayer C']","['Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, 1995 University Avenue, Suite 460, Berkeley, CA, 94704, USA. amandawsinger@gmail.com.', 'Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, 1995 University Avenue, Suite 460, Berkeley, CA, 94704, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, 1995 University Avenue, Suite 460, Berkeley, CA, 94704, USA.', ""Children's Hospital Oakland, Oakland, CA, USA."", 'Division of Neonatology and Developmental Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, 1995 University Avenue, Suite 460, Berkeley, CA, 94704, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160613,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,"['7440-44-0 (Carbon)', '8059-24-3 (Vitamin B 6)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'TLM2976OFR (Riboflavin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'California/epidemiology', 'Carbon/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Dietary Supplements', 'Energy Intake', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/administration & dosage', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Maternal Health', 'Methionine/administration & dosage', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Care', 'Riboflavin/administration & dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Vitamin B 12/administration & dosage', 'Vitamin B 6/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer risk', 'Case/control', 'Epidemiology', 'Methyl donors', 'Micronutrients']",2016/06/14 06:00,2017/02/06 06:00,['2016/06/14 06:00'],"['2016/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10552-016-0773-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10552-016-0773-y [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2016 Jul;27(7):929-40. doi: 10.1007/s10552-016-0773-y.

In murine bone marrow transplant models, PD-L1 expression on host target tissues reduces the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). PD-L1 is also expressed on T cells; however, it is unclear whether PD-L1 on this population influences immune function. Here, we examined the effects of PD-L1 modulation of T cell function in GVHD. In patients with severe GVHD, PD-L1 expression was increased on donor T cells. Compared with mice that received WT T cells, GVHD was reduced in animals that received T cells from Pdl1-/- donors. PD-L1-deficient T cells had reduced expression of gut homing receptors, diminished production of inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced rates of apoptosis. Moreover, multiple bioenergetic pathways, including aerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid metabolism, were also reduced in T cells lacking PD-L1.

Given the extensive crosstalk that occurs between mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling pathways, we assessed the role of the mTORC1 substrate S6K1 in the regulation of both normal HSC functions and in leukemogenesis driven by the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion oncogene MLL-AF9. We demonstrated that S6K1 deficiency impairs self-renewal of murine HSCs by reducing p21 expression. Loss of S6K1 also improved survival in mice transplanted with MLL-AF9-positive leukemic stem cells by modulating AKT and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Taken together, these results suggest that S6K1 acts through multiple targets of the mTOR pathway to promote self-renewal and leukemia progression. Given the recent interest in S6K1 as a potential therapeutic target in cancer, our results further support targeting this molecule as a potential strategy for treatment of myeloid malignancies.","['Ghosh, Joydeep', 'Kobayashi, Michihiro', 'Ramdas, Baskar', 'Chatterjee, Anindya', 'Ma, Peilin', 'Mali, Raghuveer Singh', 'Carlesso, Nadia', 'Liu, Yan', 'Plas, David R', 'Chan, Rebecca J', 'Kapur, Reuben']","['Ghosh J', 'Kobayashi M', 'Ramdas B', 'Chatterjee A', 'Ma P', 'Mali RS', 'Carlesso N', 'Liu Y', 'Plas DR', 'Chan RJ', 'Kapur R']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160613,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Eif4ebp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factors)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Akt1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Rps6ka1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70kD, polypeptide 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Disease Progression', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/metabolism', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Multiprotein Complexes/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism']",,,2016/06/14 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2016/06/14 06:00'],"['2015/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['84565 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI84565 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2016 Jul 1;126(7):2621-5. doi: 10.1172/JCI84565.

However, in some patients, the disease is resistant to imatinib. This resistance may be related to the presence of genetic variations on the drug's pharmacokinetics and metabolism. We therefore studied three polymorphisms (C1236T, G2677T and C3435T) in the human multidrug-resistance gene (MDR1) in 86 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia treated with imatinib. Imatinib resistance was more frequent in patients with TT genotype at locus 1236 than in those with CT/CC genotypes (p=0.003). For the other two loci (G2677T and C3435T), resistance was seen to be higher for TT genotype when compared to GG/GT and CT/CC but it was not statistically significant (p=0.13 and p=0.099).

The present review elucidates the potential of miR-155 as a diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive biomarker in B-cell malignancies using a systematic search strategy to identify relevant literature. miR-155 was upregulated in several malignancies compared to nonmalignant controls and overexpression of miR-155 was further associated with poor prognosis. Elevated expression of miR-155 shows potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Additionally, in vitro and in vivo studies suggest miR-155 as an efficient therapeutic target, supporting its oncogenic function. The use of inhibiting anti-miR structures indicates promising potential as novel anticancer therapeutics.

Despite being extremely effective anti-cancer agents, the application of these drugs is offset by side effects, most notably cardiotoxicity. Many patients treated with doxorubicin (DOX), one of the most common anthracyclines used in oncology, will develop radiographic signs and/or symptoms of cardiomyopathy. Since more and more patients treated with these drugs are surviving their malignancies and manifesting with heart disease, there is particular interest in understanding the mechanisms of anthracycline-induced injury and developing ways to prevent and treat its most feared complication, heart failure. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of mRNAs. Since miRNAs can regulate many mRNAs in a single network they tend to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including heart failure. Here we present a perspective on a recent work by Roca-Alonso and colleagues who demonstrate a cardioprotective function of the miR-30 family members following DOX-induced cardiac injury. They provide evidence for direct targeting of these miRNAs on key elements of the beta-adrenergic pathway and further show that this interaction regulates cardiac function and apoptosis.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). In addition, there may be an association between leukemia and lymphoma and IBD. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the IBD literature to estimate the incidence of CRC, leukemia, and lymphoma in adult IBD patients. Methods. Studies were identified by a literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. Pooled incidence rates (per 100,000 person-years [py]) were calculated through use of a random effects model, unless substantial heterogeneity prevented pooling of estimates. Several stratified analyses and metaregression were performed to explore potential study heterogeneity and bias. Results. Thirty-six articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. For CRC, the pooled incidence rate in CD was 53.3/100,000 py (95% CI 46.3-60.3/100,000).

We demonstrate that in a subset of cases, this information is clinically relevant and should be reported to ensure adequate follow-up. METHOD: Genome-wide NIPT was carried out and followed by a software analysis pipeline optimized to detect subchromosomal aberrations. RESULTS: The NIPT profile showed deletions on chromosomes 9 and 22: NIPT 9q33.3q34.12(129150001-133750000)x1,22q11.23(23550001-25450000)x1,22q13.1(3785000 1-39600000)x1. This result was confirmed by single nucleotide polymorphism array on maternal genomic DNA, which also demonstrated that the deletions were somatic in nature. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that the deletions were flanking the translocation breakpoint on the derivative chromosome 9 as the result of a t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) translocation with BCR-ABL1 fusion typical for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Multidisciplinary counselling, together with complete blood count, taught that the woman was in an early chronic phase CML. The woman was followed up closely, and treatment could be postponed until after delivery. CONCLUSION: Genome-wide NIPT identified a CML in chronic phase caused by the typical t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) translocation and accompanied by deletions flanking the translocation breakpoints.

Monocytes that phagocytosed platelets were detected as a CMFDA-positive platelet population via monocyte gate. The FMPA results were compared with CCI results for the patients. RESULTS: The FMPA result correlated with 1-hour (r = -0.885, P = 0.001) and 24-hour (r = -0.884, P = 0.001) CCI.

We show that treatment of human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumour cells with imatinib and the closely-related drug, nilotinib, strikingly increases tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the downstream adaptor protein paxillin (PXN), resulting in enhanced cell migration and invasion. Imatinib and nilotinib-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was dependent on expression of p130Cas and FAK activity and was independent of known imatinib targets including Abl, platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta) and the collagen receptor DDR1. Imatinib and nilotinib treatment increased two dimensional cell migration and three dimensional radial spheroid invasion in collagen. In addition, silencing of p130Cas and inhibition of FAK activity both strongly reduced imatinib and nilotinib stimulated invasion.

We compared the outcomes of HID transplantation with those of matched related donor (MRD) transplantation in a cohort study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 90 consecutive patients who received allogeneic HSCT because of CML-BC were investigated retrospectively. A total of 67 patients underwent transplantation from HID and 23 from MRD. Survival outcomes were compared between the two cohorts. RESULTS: Of the 90 patients, 86 patients were engrafted. Three-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were comparable between HID and MRD recipients (OS: 60.0% vs 55.3%, respectively, P=.580; RFS: 51.1% vs 47.8%, respectively, P=.512). Three-year incidences of transplant-related mortality (TRM) and relapse did not differ between HID and MRD recipients (relapse: 21.0% vs 26.1%, respectively, P=.626; TRM: 27.9% vs 26.1%, respectively, P=.937). In multivariate analyses, previous chemotherapy history and not achieving CHR before HSCT are independent adverse predictors of OS. CONCLUSIONS: For CML-blast crisis or chronic phase from blast crisis patients, HID transplantation achieves comparable survival to MRD transplantation. HID donors can be regarded as regular donors for these special patients at selected centers.","['Ma, Yan-Ru', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Xu, Zheng-Li', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Chen, Huan', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Han, Wei', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Wang, Feng-Rong', 'Wang, Jing-Zhi', 'Wang, Yu', 'Chen, Yao', 'Yan, Chen-Hua', 'Xu, Lan-Ping']","['Ma YR', 'Huang XJ', 'Xu ZL', 'Liu KY', 'Chen H', 'Zhang XH', 'Han W', 'Chen YH', 'Wang FR', 'Wang JZ', 'Wang Y', 'Chen Y', 'Yan CH', 'Xu LP']","[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.', ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China. lpxu_0415@sina.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160711,Denmark,Clin Transplant,Clinical transplantation,8710240,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blast Crisis/diagnosis/*surgery', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', '*Directed Tissue Donation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/*surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Siblings', 'Time Factors', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*blast crisis', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*haploidentical', '*hematological stem cell transplantation']",2016/06/14 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/06/14 06:00'],"['2016/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ctr.12779 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transplant. 2016 Sep;30(9):994-1001. doi: 10.1111/ctr.12779.

Genetic gain-of-function mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 confer a neomorphic activity that allow reduction of alpha -KG to (R)-2- hydroxyglutarate, the accumulation of which results in the development of cancers like low grade gliomas and leukemia. After treatment with AG-221 in clinical trials, a first-in-class inhibitor of mutated IDH2, 29 patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome experience complete remissions and the overall response rate is 59/159 (37%). Thus, IDH mutants have become intriguing targets for cancer therapeutics. In addition to providing a brief summary of IDH mutations, this review describes known inhibitors with potential activities against IDH mutants such as AG-120, AG-221, AG-881 and AGI-6780. The evolving landscape of IDH mutant inhibitors provides us an outlook on the discovery of novel, safer, and more effective cancer treatment strategies.","['Chen, Jiao', 'Yang, Jie', 'Cao, Peng']","['Chen J', 'Yang J', 'Cao P']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Jiangsu Province Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. pcao79@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Mini Rev Med Chem,Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,101094212,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Mutant Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics']",,,2016/06/14 06:00,2017/03/07 06:00,['2016/06/14 06:00'],"['2015/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['MRMC-EPUB-76427 [pii]', '10.2174/1389557516666160609085520 [doi]']",ppublish,Mini Rev Med Chem. 2016;16(16):1344-1358. doi: 10.2174/1389557516666160609085520.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ESC-derived epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) and the postimplantation epiblast exhibit primed pluripotency. Although core pluripotency factors are well-characterized, additional regulators, including Otx2, recently have been shown to function during the transition from naive to primed pluripotency. Here we uncover a role for Otx2 in the control of the naive pluripotent state. We analyzed Otx2-binding activity in ESCs and EpiSCs and identified Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 as direct targets. To unravel the Otx2 transcriptional network, we targeted the strongest Otx2-binding site in the Nanog promoter, finding that this site modulates the size of specific ESC-subtype compartments in cultured cells and promotes Nanog expression in vivo, predisposing ICM differentiation to epiblast. Otx2-mediated Nanog regulation thus contributes to the integrity of the ESC state and cell lineage specification in preimplantation development.","['Acampora, Dario', 'Omodei, Daniela', 'Petrosino, Giuseppe', 'Garofalo, Arcomaria', 'Savarese, Marco', 'Nigro, Vincenzo', 'Di Giovannantonio, Luca Giovanni', 'Mercadante, Vincenzo', 'Simeone, Antonio']","['Acampora D', 'Omodei D', 'Petrosino G', 'Garofalo A', 'Savarese M', 'Nigro V', 'Di Giovannantonio LG', 'Mercadante V', 'Simeone A']","['Institute of Genetics and Biophysics ""Adriano Buzzati-Traverso,"" CNR, Via P.

However, ADAR1 editase-dependent mechanisms governing leukemia stem cell (LSC) generation have not been elucidated. In blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (BC CML), we show that increased JAK2 signaling and BCR-ABL1 amplification activate ADAR1. In a humanized BC CML mouse model, combined JAK2 and BCR-ABL1 inhibition prevents LSC self-renewal commensurate with ADAR1 downregulation. Lentiviral ADAR1 wild-type, but not an editing-defective ADAR1(E912A) mutant, induces self-renewal gene expression and impairs biogenesis of stem cell regulatory let-7 microRNAs. Combined RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, CLIP-ADAR1, and pri-let-7 mutagenesis data suggest that ADAR1 promotes LSC generation via let-7 pri-microRNA editing and LIN28B upregulation. A small-molecule tool compound antagonizes ADAR1's effect on LSC self-renewal in stromal co-cultures and restores let-7 biogenesis.

In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated busulfan-induced cell apoptosis. Whether busulfan triggers platelet apoptosis remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the role of busulfan in platelet apoptosis. Isolated human platelets were incubated with busulfan followed by analysis of platelet apoptosis by flow cytometry or western blot, including mitochondrial depolarization, expression of Bcl-2, and Bax and caspase 3 activation. Meanwhile, platelet activation, expression of glycoprotein Ibalpha (GPIbalpha), glycoprotein VI (GPVI), and <alpha>IIb<beta>3 and platelet aggregation in response to collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were measured. Additionally, busulfan was injected into mice with or without administration of caspase inhibitor QVD-Oph to investigate its effect on platelet lifespan. Our results showed that busulfan-treated platelets displayed increased mitochondrial membrane depolarization, decreased expression of Bcl-2, increased expression of Bax and caspase 3 activation in dose-dependent manner, which were inhibited by QVD-Oph. Platelet activation was not observed in busulfan-treated platelets as showed by no increased P-selectin expression and PAC-1 binding. However, busulfan reduced collagen- or ADP-induced platelet aggregation without affecting expression of GPIbalpha, GPVI, and <alpha>IIb<beta>3. Furthermore, busulfan reduced circulating platelet lifespan which was ameliorated by QVD-Oph in mice. In conclusion, busulfan triggers mitochondrial-dependent platelet apoptosis and reduces platelet lifespan in mice. These data suggest targeting caspase activation might be beneficial in the prophylaxis of platelet apoptosis-associated thrombocytopenia after administration of busulfan.","['Qiao, Jianlin', 'Wu, Yulu', 'Liu, Yun', 'Li, Xiaoqian', 'Wu, Xiaoqing', 'Liu, Na', 'Zhu, Feng', 'Qi, Kunming', 'Cheng, Hai', 'Li, Depeng', 'Li, Hongchun', 'Li, Zhenyu', 'Zeng, Lingyu', 'Ma, Ping', 'Xu, Kailin']","['Qiao J', 'Wu Y', 'Liu Y', 'Li X', 'Wu X', 'Liu N', 'Zhu F', 'Qi K', 'Cheng H', 'Li D', 'Li H', 'Li Z', 'Zeng L', 'Ma P', 'Xu K']","['Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China; Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China; Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province 221002, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China; Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province 221002, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China; Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province 221002, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China; Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province 221002, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Tengzhou Central People's Hospital, Tengzhou 277500, China."", 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China; Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China; Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province 221002, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, China.

We sought to determine whether inotuzumab ozogamicin, an anti-CD22 antibody conjugated to calicheamicin, results in better outcomes in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia than does standard therapy. METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned adults with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia to receive either inotuzumab ozogamicin (inotuzumab ozogamicin group) or standard intensive chemotherapy (standard-therapy group). The primary end points were complete remission (including complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) and overall survival. RESULTS: Of the 326 patients who underwent randomization, the first 218 (109 in each group) were included in the primary intention-to-treat analysis of complete remission. The rate of complete remission was significantly higher in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group than in the standard-therapy group (80.7% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 72.1 to 87.7] vs. 29.4% [95% CI, 21.0 to 38.8], P<0.001). Among the patients who had complete remission, a higher percentage in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group had results below the threshold for minimal residual disease (0.01% marrow blasts) (78.4% vs. 28.1%, P<0.001); the duration of remission was longer in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group (median, 4.6 months [95% CI, 3.9 to 5.4] vs. 3.1 months [95% CI, 1.4 to 4.9]; hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.96]; P=0.03). In the survival analysis, which included all 326 patients, progression-free survival was significantly longer in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group (median, 5.0 months [95% CI, 3.7 to 5.6] vs. 1.8 months [95% CI, 1.5 to 2.2]; hazard ratio, 0.45 [97.5% CI, 0.34 to 0.61]; P<0.001); the median overall survival was 7.7 months (95% CI, 6.0 to 9.2) versus 6.7 months (95% CI, 4.9 to 8.3), and the hazard ratio was 0.77 (97.5% CI, 0.58 to 1.03) (P=0.04). In the safety population, the most frequent grade 3 or higher nonhematologic adverse events with inotuzumab ozogamicin were liver-related. Veno-occlusive liver disease of any grade occurred in 15 patients (11%) who received inotuzumab ozogamicin and in 1 patient (1%) who received standard therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of complete remission was higher with inotuzumab ozogamicin than with standard therapy, and a higher percentage of patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group had results below the threshold for minimal residual disease. Both progression-free and overall survival were longer with inotuzumab ozogamicin. Veno-occlusive liver disease was a major adverse event associated with inotuzumab ozogamicin.

In this study, the associations between SIRT2 expression and molecular and clinical characteristics of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were evaluated by data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. SIRT2 was overexpressed in the intermediate- and poor-risk groups of patients, compared to the favorable-risk group of patients (P = 0.002 and 0.004, respectively). High SIRT2 expression was associated with significantly shorter overall survival (OS; P = 0.0005) and event-free survival (EFS; P = 0.0002) than low SIRT2 expressio in a cohort of 167 patients with AML. Multivariate analyses revealed that high SIRT2 expression was associated with shorter OS (P = 0.031) and EFS (P = 0.020). Gene-expression profiling showed 259 differential expressed genes including CD4, CD14 and IL10. Gene sets like MAPK signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway and acute myeloid leukemia were upregulated in SIRT2(high) patients. We also found different methylation patterns in these two groups. OS and EFS of SIRT2(high) patients who did not undergo transplantation were significantly shorter than those of SIRT2(low) patients (P = 0.0120 and P = 0.0107, respectively). Taken together, these findings suggest that high SIRT2 expression is a novel and unfavorable prognostic biomarker for AML risk-stratification.","['Deng, Ailing', 'Ning, Qiaoyang', 'Zhou, Lei', 'Liang, Yaojie']","['Deng A', 'Ning Q', 'Zhou L', 'Liang Y']","['Medicine College, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'Medicine College, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, No.202 Hospital of PLA, Shenyang, 110083, China.', 'Department of Senior Hematology and Oncology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100048, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160613,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Methylation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Sirtuin 2/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/06/14 06:00,2018/05/25 06:00,['2016/06/14 06:00'],"['2016/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/25 06:00 [medline]']","['srep27694 [pii]', '10.1038/srep27694 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Jun 13;6:27694. doi: 10.1038/srep27694.,10.1038/srep27694 [doi],,PMC4904374,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By analogy to selective estrogen receptor modulator for treatment of cancer, selective or partial PPARgamma agonists are considered clinically important for chemotherapy of cancer. OBJECTIVE: In this study we have rationally modified the structure of existing p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid, which would selectively activate PPARgamma and exert their anti-proliferative effect at lower dose as compared to natural phytoconstituents. METHOD: A series of p-coumaric (3a-3y) and ferulic acid (4a-4y) derivatives were designed as docked and virtually studied for their molecular properties using suitable software. Synthesized derivatives were assessed to check their effect on non-transformed hepatocytes using MTT assay. The final products, 3a-3y and 4a-4y, substituted 4- hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and ferulic acid derivatives respectively were synthesized by stirring compound 1a or 1b with compounds 2a-2y (molar ratio- 1:2) for 24 hours, in presence of K2CO3, using dimethyl formamide (DMF) as the solvent. Synthesized molecules were characterized by 1HNMR, 13C NMR, Mass and elemental analysis. Synthesized molecules were studied for their antiproliferative activity by SRB assay. Compounds were screened further evaluated for PPARgamma activating assay, cell cycle analysis (propidium iodide) and westernblot analysis. RESULTS: Molecules 3c, 3m, 4c and 4m were found to have GI50 value less than 50muM. These molecules were found to block G0/G1 phase of cell cycle in dose dependent manner. Western blot analysis revealed that these molecules inhibit proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cyclin D1 expression. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results suggest that these molecules could play a role as a novel therapeutic strategy for chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Joshi, Hardik', 'Marulkar, Kavita', 'Gota, Vikram', 'Ramaa, C S']","['Joshi H', 'Marulkar K', 'Gota V', 'Ramaa CS']","[""Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Pharmacy, CBD Belapur, Navi Mumbai, India."", ""Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Pharmacy, CBD Belapur, Navi Mumbai, India."", ""Tata Memorial's Advance Centre in Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC), Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, India."", ""Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Pharmacy, CBD Belapur, Navi Mumbai, India.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coumaric Acids)', '0 (PPAR alpha)', 'AVM951ZWST (ferulic acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Computer Simulation', 'Coumaric Acids/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Partial Agonism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'PPAR alpha/*agonists', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",['NOTNLM'],"['K562', 'Partial PPARgamma agonists', 'cell cycle', 'hydroxycinaamic acid', 'western blot analysis']",2016/06/14 06:00,2017/08/19 06:00,['2016/06/14 06:00'],"['2016/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.2174/1871520616666160607010156 [doi]', 'ACAMC-EPUB-76308 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2017;17(4):524-541. doi: 10.2174/1871520616666160607010156.,10.2174/1871520616666160607010156 [doi],,,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of new antibodies has however, facilitated the use of immuno-chemotherapy in co-morbid patients. Beyond this, the recognition that CLL cells are critically dependent on B-cell receptor (BCR) signalling and interactions with the cellular micro-environment for proliferation and survival has led to the investigation of BCR inhibitors in CLL treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The findings show that before curriculum participation, clinicians demonstrated a high proficiency in their knowledge of first- and second-line therapies. However, they were challenged when asked to apply this knowledge to patient case studies. This clinical gap was then targeted through a multiple-activity educational curriculum platform that allowed participants to engage with nationally recognized CML experts about how to apply the latest clinical research and therapeutic advances to patient management. RESULTS: After evaluating these clinicians at the completion of the curriculum, the data showed that the program had successfully improved clinical performance regarding the treatment of patients requiring first-line therapies and treatment intensification in refractory CML (low-intermediate and high Sokal scores). However, participants remained challenged concerning the treatment of patients with intermediate Sokal scores who require treatment intensification after first-line therapy.

Questionnaires were sent to the bereaved family members of adult leukemia and lymphoma patients. We used the Care Evaluation Scale (CES) and asked the bereaved family members about care satisfaction and ""good death"" factors during the patient's last week of life or last admission period. We distributed 177 questionnaires and were able to analyze 103 (58.2%) responses. Compared with the results of a previous study of palliative care units in Japan, the CES scores were significantly lower in 9 out of 10 domains. Assessment of the ""good death"" components revealed that only 33% of respondents agreed that the patient had been relieved as far as possible of pain and physical distress during the last week of life. Only 21.4% of respondents agreed that the patient had been relieved as far as possible of psychological distress, and 57% of caregivers were not satisfied with the level of care. During the last hospitalizations of leukemia or lymphoma patients, their care was insufficient and a good death was not often achieved.

We evaluated the effects of chemotherapy on the cell number and activity of NK cells from patients who received the vincristine-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-prednisone (VCAP), doxorubicin-ranimustine-prednisone (AMP), and vindesine-etoposide-carboplatin-prednisone (VECP) (mLSG15) or mLSG15-like (-L) regimen, which is one of the standard of cares for newly diagnosed adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL), or the cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone (CHOP) or CHOP-L regimen which is another standard of care for ATL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). METHODS: The number of lymphocytes and NK cells, and NK cell activity, were assessed using flow cytometry and a (51)Cr release assay, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients with untreated ATL or PTCL were enrolled, and blood samples from 25 patients were evaluable. NK cell number in ATL decreased after mLSG15/-L treatment, and the degree of decrease in the NK cell number was more prominent just before VECP therapy (Day 15-17 of each cycle) than just before VCAP therapy (Day 1 of each cycle). The NK cell number in ATL after CHOP/-L treatment also decreased. Interestingly, the NK cell activity showed a tendency to increase after the treatment. NK cell number in PTCL did not decrease by CHOP/-L regimen, but the activity was slightly decreased after the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on NK cells vary according to the disease type and intensity of chemotherapy.","['Ogura, Michinori', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Tsukasaki, Kunihiro', 'Takahashi, Takeshi', 'Utsunomiya, Atae']","['Ogura M', 'Ishida T', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Takahashi T', 'Utsunomiya A']","['Department of Hematology, Tokai Central Hospital, Kakamigahara, Gifu, 504-8601, Japan. mi-ogura@naa.att.ne.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya Daini Red Cross Hospital, Nagoya, Aichi, 466-8650, Japan. mi-ogura@naa.att.ne.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Aichi, 467-8601, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa, Chiba, 277-8577, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Molecular Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Science, Nagasaki-shi, Nagasaki, 852-8523, Japan.', 'Oncology R&D Unit, R&D Division, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 100-8185, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kamoikeshinmachi, Kagoshima, 890-0064, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160611,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'RYH2T97J77 (ranimustine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Vindesine/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ATL', '*Antibody', '*Chemotherapy', '*NK cell', '*PTCL']",2016/06/13 06:00,2017/06/07 06:00,['2016/06/13 06:00'],"['2016/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00280-016-3070-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-016-3070-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2016 Jul;78(1):199-207. doi: 10.1007/s00280-016-3070-2.

Clinical trials of human gene therapy began with the ex vivo techniques. Based on the initial successes of gene-therapy clinical trials, these approaches have spread worldwide. The number of gene therapy trials approved worldwide increased gradually starting in 1989, reaching 116 protocols per year in 1999, and a total of 2210 protocols had been approved by 2015. Accumulating clinical evidence has demonstrated the safety and benefits of several types of gene therapy, with the exception of serious adverse events in several clinical trials. These painful experiences were translated backward to basic science, resulting in the development of several new technologies that have influenced the recent development of ex vivo gene therapy in this field. To date, six gene therapies have been approved in a limited number of countries worldwide. In Japan, clinical trials of gene therapy have developed under the strong influence of trials in the US and Europe. Since the initial stages, 50 clinical trials have been approved by the Japanese government.

We are in quest of novel anti-proliferative agents to overcome drug-resistant tumor cells. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of 7 naturally occurring phenolic compounds including two isoflavonoids alpinumisoflavone (1) and laburnetin (2), one biflavonoid amentoflavone (3), three lignans pycnanthulignene A (4), pycnanthulignene B (5), and syringaresinol (7) and one xanthone, euxanthone (6) against 9 drug-sensitive and MDR cancer cell lines. The resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of these compounds, whilst caspase-Glo assay was used to detect caspase activation. Cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were all analyzed via flow cytometry. RESULTS: The IC50 values for the investigational phenolics ranged from 5.91 microM (towards leukemia CEM/ADR5000 cells) to 65.65 microM (towards drug-resistant breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231-BCRP cells) for 1, 27.63 microM (towards leukemia CCRF-CEM cells) to 107.57 microM (towards MDA-MB-231-pcDNA cells) for 2, from 5.84 microM (towards CEM/ADR5000 cells) to 65.32 microM (towards colon carcinoma HCT116 (p53(-/-)) cells) for 4 and 0.20 microM (towards CCRF-CEM cells) to 195.12 microM (towards leukemia CEM/ADR5000) for doxorubicin. Phenolics 3, 5, 6 and 7 displayed selectivity cytotoxic effects on cancer cells lines. Compounds 1 and 4 induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells, mediated by loss of MMP and increase ROS production. CONCLUSIONS: The studied phenolics and mostly isoflavonoid 1 and lignan 4 are potential cytotoxic natural products that deserve more investigations to develop novel antineoplastic drugs against multifactorial drug-resistant cancers.","['Kuete, Victor', 'Mbaveng, Armelle T', 'Nono, Eric C N', 'Simo, Christophe C', 'Zeino, Maen', 'Nkengfack, Augustin E', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Kuete V', 'Mbaveng AT', 'Nono EC', 'Simo CC', 'Zeino M', 'Nkengfack AE', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz 55128, Germany; Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Dschang, Dschang, Cameroon.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde I, Yaounde, Cameroon.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde I, Yaounde, Cameroon.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz 55128, Germany.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde I, Yaounde, Cameroon.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz 55128, Germany.

We sequenced the coding regions or hotspot areas of 68 recurrently mutated genes in a cohort of 664 patients aged 18 to 86 years treated on 2 phase 3 trials of the German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG). The median number of 4 mutations per patient varied according to cytogenetic subgroup, age, and history of previous hematologic disorder or antineoplastic therapy. We found patterns of significantly comutated driver genes suggesting functional synergism. Conversely, we identified 8 virtually nonoverlapping patient subgroups, jointly comprising 78% of AML patients, that are defined by mutually exclusive genetic alterations. These subgroups, likely representing distinct underlying pathways of leukemogenesis, show widely divergent outcomes. Furthermore, we provide detailed information on associations between gene mutations, clinical patient characteristics, and therapeutic outcomes in this large cohort of uniformly treated AML patients. In multivariate analyses including a comprehensive set of molecular and clinical variables, we identified DNMT3A and RUNX1 mutations as important predictors of shorter overall survival (OS) in AML patients <60 years, and particularly in those with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. NPM1 mutations in the absence of FLT3-ITD, mutated TP53, and biallelic CEBPA mutations were identified as important molecular prognosticators of OS irrespective of patient age. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive overview of the spectrum, clinical associations, and prognostic relevance of recurrent driver gene mutations in a large cohort representing a broad spectrum and age range of intensively treated AML patients.","['Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Herold, Tobias', 'Rothenberg-Thurley, Maja', 'Amler, Susanne', 'Sauerland, Maria C', 'Gorlich, Dennis', 'Schneider, Stephanie', 'Konstandin, Nikola P', 'Dufour, Annika', 'Braundl, Kathrin', 'Ksienzyk, Bianka', 'Zellmeier, Evelyn', 'Hartmann, Luise', 'Greif, Philipp A', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'Subklewe, Marion', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Krug, Utz', 'Faldum, Andreas', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Wormann, Bernhard', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Braess, Jan', 'Spiekermann, Karsten']","['Metzeler KH', 'Herold T', 'Rothenberg-Thurley M', 'Amler S', 'Sauerland MC', 'Gorlich D', 'Schneider S', 'Konstandin NP', 'Dufour A', 'Braundl K', 'Ksienzyk B', 'Zellmeier E', 'Hartmann L', 'Greif PA', 'Fiegl M', 'Subklewe M', 'Bohlander SK', 'Krug U', 'Faldum A', 'Berdel WE', 'Wormann B', 'Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Braess J', 'Spiekermann K']","['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Internal Medicine III, Ludwig-Maximilans-Universitat, Munich, Germany;

In this work we explored the mechanism of the antileukemic activity of NCP in T-cell lymphoblast cells (CCRF-CEM). Specifically, we searched for a potential link between its ability to induce cell death on the one hand and to modulate intracellular glutathione (GSH) that is necessary to its metabolic transformation via glutathione-S-transferase on the other hand. We have observed that GSH levels decreased rapidly in NCP-treated cells. Despite a complete regeneration following 24h of incubation with NCP, this profound drop in cellular GSH content triggered ER stress, ROS production and lipid peroxidation leading to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). These events induced concentration-dependent cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase and apoptosis. Both MMP loss and apoptosis were reversed by sulfhydryl-containing compounds (GSH, N-acetyl-l-cysteine). Furthermore, we have also shown that NCP-induced GSH decrease activated the Nrf2 pathway and its downstream targets NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase (NQO-1) and glutamate cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLm), thus explaining the fast restoration of GSH pool and ROS decrease. Importantly, we confirmed that the cell death-inducing properties of the compounds were co-dependent on their ability to diminish cellular GSH level by analyzing the relationships between the GSH-depleting potency and cytotoxicity in a series of other norbornylpurine analogs. Altogether, the results demonstrated that in CCRF-CEM cells NCP triggered apoptosis through GSH depletion-associated oxidative and ER stress and mitochondrial depolarization.","['Plackova, Pavla', 'Sala, Michal', 'Smidkova, Marketa', 'Dejmek, Milan', 'Hrebabecky, Hubert', 'Nencka, Radim', 'Thibaut, Hendrik-Jan', 'Neyts, Johan', 'Mertlikova-Kaiserova, Helena']","['Plackova P', 'Sala M', 'Smidkova M', 'Dejmek M', 'Hrebabecky H', 'Nencka R', 'Thibaut HJ', 'Neyts J', 'Mertlikova-Kaiserova H']","['Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i., 166 10 Prague 6, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i., 166 10 Prague 6, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i., 166 10 Prague 6, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i., 166 10 Prague 6, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i., 166 10 Prague 6, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i., 166 10 Prague 6, Czech Republic.', 'Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven, Minderbroedersstraat 10, BE-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven, Minderbroedersstraat 10, BE-3000 Leuven, Belgium.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i., 166 10 Prague 6, Czech Republic.

Mutation or mis-regulation of Hmx1 underlies malformations of the eye and external ear in multiple species. Deletion or insertional duplication of an evolutionarily conserved region (ECR) downstream of Hmx1 has recently been described in rat and cow, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that the impact of Hmx1 loss is greater than previously appreciated, with a variety of lateral cranioskeletal defects, auriculofacial nerve deficits, and duplication of the caudal region of the external ear. Using a transgenic approach, we demonstrate that a 594 bp sequence encompassing the ECR recapitulates specific aspects of the endogenous Hmx1 lateral facial expression pattern. Moreover, we show that Hoxa2, Meis and Pbx proteins act cooperatively on the ECR, via a core 32 bp sequence, to regulate Hmx1 expression. These studies highlight the conserved role for Hmx1 in BA2-derived tissues and provide an entry point for improved understanding of the causes of the frequent lateral facial birth defects in humans.","['Rosin, Jessica M', 'Li, Wenjie', 'Cox, Liza L', 'Rolfe, Sara M', 'Latorre, Victor', 'Akiyama, Jennifer A', 'Visel, Axel', 'Kuramoto, Takashi', 'Bobola, Nicoletta', 'Turner, Eric E', 'Cox, Timothy C']","['Rosin JM', 'Li W', 'Cox LL', 'Rolfe SM', 'Latorre V', 'Akiyama JA', 'Visel A', 'Kuramoto T', 'Bobola N', 'Turner EE', 'Cox TC']","[""Center for Developmental Biology & Regenerative Medicine, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA 98101, USA."", ""Center for Developmental Biology & Regenerative Medicine, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA 98101, USA Department of Oral Health Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA."", ""Center for Developmental Biology & Regenerative Medicine, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA 98101, USA Department of Pediatrics (Craniofacial Medicine), University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA."", ""Center for Developmental Biology & Regenerative Medicine, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA 98101, USA."", 'School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.', 'Functional Genomics Department, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.', 'Functional Genomics Department, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA DOE Joint Genome Institute, Walnut Creek, CA 94598, USA School of Natural Sciences, University of California, Merced, CA 95343, USA.', 'Institute of Laboratory Animals, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.', ""Center for Integrative Brain Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA 98101, USA Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA."", ""Center for Developmental Biology & Regenerative Medicine, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA 98101, USA Department of Oral Health Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA Department of Pediatrics (Craniofacial Medicine), University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia tccox@uw.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20160610,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxa2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mrg1 protein, mouse)', '0 (NKX5-3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Pairing/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Conserved Sequence/genetics', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities/genetics', 'Ear Auricle/abnormalities/*metabolism/pathology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Face/embryology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Morphogenesis/*genetics', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', 'Physical Stimulation', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Sensory Receptor Cells/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Craniofacial mesenchyme', '*Enhancer', '*Evolutionarily conserved region (ECR)', '*Hmx1', '*Mouse', '*Pinna']",2016/06/12 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2016/06/12 06:00'],"['2015/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['dev.133736 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.133736 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2016 Jul 15;143(14):2582-92. doi: 10.1242/dev.133736.

Whether these apply to modern units dedicated to the care of hematologic malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) procedures is unknown. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 780 consecutive admissions for acute leukemia, autologous HSCT, or allogeneic HSCT in which the patient was at risk for hospital-acquired VRE and underwent weekly surveillance. We also obtained staff and room cultures, observed staff behavior, and performed VRE molecular strain typing on selected isolates. RESULTS: The overall rate of VRE colonization was 11.4 cases/1,000 patient days. Cultures of room surfaces revealed VRE isolates in 10% of terminally cleaned rooms. A prior VRE-colonized room occupant did not increase risk, and paired isolates from 20 patients and prior occupants were indistinguishable on molecular typing in only 1 pair. VRE colonization pressure was significantly associated with acquisition. Cultures of unit personnel and shared equipment were negative except for weighing scales. Observation of unit clinical personnel showed high compliance for hand sanitation and but less so for gowns. Conversely, ancillary staff showed poor compliance. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of VRE from room surfaces seems to be an infrequent event. Encouraging adherence to surveillance, disinfection, and contact isolation protocols may decrease VRE colonization rates.","['Ford, Clyde D', 'Lopansri, Bert K', 'Gazdik, Michaela A', 'Webb, Brandon', 'Snow, Gregory L', 'Hoda, Daanish', 'Adams, Barbara', 'Petersen, Finn Bo']","['Ford CD', 'Lopansri BK', 'Gazdik MA', 'Webb B', 'Snow GL', 'Hoda D', 'Adams B', 'Petersen FB']","['Intermountain Acute Leukemia and Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT; Division of Infectious Diseases, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT.

In this report, we show that elevation of angiopoietin-1 in myelodysplastic CD34(+) stem-like cells is associated with higher risk disease and reduced overall survival in MDS and AML patients. Increased angiopoietin-1 expression was associated with a transcriptomic signature similar to known MDS/AML stem-like cell profiles. In seeking a small-molecule inhibitor of this pathway, we discovered and validated pexmetinib (ARRY-614), an inhibitor of the angiopoietin-1 receptor Tie-2, which was also found to inhibit the proinflammatory kinase p38 MAPK (which is overactivated in MDS). Pexmetinib inhibited leukemic proliferation, prevented activation of downstream effector kinases, and abrogated the effects of TNFalpha on healthy hematopoietic stem cells.

Deficiency in p18 predisposes mice and humans to hematopoietic lymphoid malignancies such as T-cell leukemia and multiple myeloma. However, the mechanism by which p18 regulates differentiation from HSCs to lymphoid cells is poorly understood. In this study, we found that a progenitor population characterized by its expression of surface markers, Lin(-) Sca-1(+) c-Kit(low) (LSK(low)), was markedly expanded in the bone marrow of p18 knock-out (p18(-/-)) mice. This novel population possessed lymphoid differentiation potential, but not myeloid differentiation potential, both in vitro and in vivo. Whereas LSK(low) cells and common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) overlapped functionally in generating lymphoid cells, they were distinct cell populations, because they had different gene expression profiles. Unlike CLPs, LSK(low) cells did not express the interleukin-7 receptor. LSK(low) cells were derived from HSCs and were independent of the p18-deleted microenvironment. This cell population may represent a previously unappreciated transitional stage from HSCs to lymphoid progenitors that is strictly restricted by p18 under physiological conditions. Likewise, LSK(low) might serve as a new cellular target of lymphoid malignances in the absence of p18.","['Dong, Fang', 'Hao, Sha', 'Ma, Shihui', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Wang, Yajie', 'Zhou, Wen', 'Yuan, Weiping', 'Ema, Hideo', 'Cheng, Tao']","['Dong F', 'Hao S', 'Ma S', 'Cheng H', 'Wang Y', 'Zhou W', 'Yuan W', 'Ema H', 'Cheng T']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tianjin, China; Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Tianjin, China; Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.

We demonstrate in whole blood from patients with CLL that lenalidomide significantly depletes malignant B cells. Lenalidomide also induced production of interleukin-21 (IL21) and its mRNA in T cells from patients with CLL. In addition, lenalidomide enhanced upregulation of functional IL21 receptor (IL21R) on the cell surface and increased receptor mRNA in vitro The in vitro combination of IL21 and lenalidomide enhanced IL21-mediated cytotoxicity toward CLL cells through a variety of mechanisms. We show association of cell death with upregulation of Bid by IL21, enhanced upregulation of Bid by the combination therapy, and diminished Lck and downstream BCR signaling activation of Syk and PLCG2. Collectively, we demonstrated an immune cell-tumor cell interaction through lenalidomide-mediated induction of IL21 and IL21R, with enhanced IL21-mediated cytotoxicity, which provides justification for this combination in clinical trials for patients with CLL.

METHODS: Using primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we fitted multivariable logistic regression models to investigate potential risk factors for postherpetic neuralgia (defined as pain >/=90 days after zoster, based on diagnostic or prescription codes), including demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and characteristics of the acute zoster episode. We also assessed whether the effects were modified by antiviral use. RESULTS: Of 119,413 zoster patients, 6,956 (5.8%) developed postherpetic neuralgia. Postherpetic neuralgia risk rose steeply with age, most sharply between 50 and 79 years (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for a 10-year increase, 1.70, 99% confidence interval 1.63-1.78). Postherpetic neuralgia risk was higher in women (6.3% vs 5.1% in men: OR 1.19, 1.10-1.27) and those with severely immunosuppressive conditions, including leukemia (13.7%: 2.07, 1.08-3.96) and lymphoma (12.7%: 2.45, 1.53-3.92); autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (9.1%: 1.20, 0.99-1.46); and other comorbidities, including asthma and diabetes. Current and ex-smokers, as well as underweight and obese individuals, were at increased risk of postherpetic neuralgia. Antiviral use was not associated with postherpetic neuralgia (OR 1.04, 0.97-1.11). However, the increased risk associated with severe immunosuppression appeared less pronounced in patients given antivirals. CONCLUSIONS: Postherpetic neuralgia risk was increased for a number of patient characteristics and comorbidities, notably with age and among those with severe immunosuppression. As zoster vaccination is contraindicated for patients with severe immunosuppression, strategies to prevent zoster in these patients, which could include the new subunit zoster vaccine, are an increasing priority.","['Forbes, Harriet J', 'Bhaskaran, Krishnan', 'Thomas, Sara L', 'Smeeth, Liam', 'Clayton, Tim', 'Mansfield, Kathryn', 'Minassian, Caroline', 'Langan, Sinead M']","['Forbes HJ', 'Bhaskaran K', 'Thomas SL', 'Smeeth L', 'Clayton T', 'Mansfield K', 'Minassian C', 'Langan SM']","['From the Faculty of Epidemiology & Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK. harriet.forbes@lshtm.ac.uk.', 'From the Faculty of Epidemiology & Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'From the Faculty of Epidemiology & Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'From the Faculty of Epidemiology & Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'From the Faculty of Epidemiology & Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'From the Faculty of Epidemiology & Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'From the Faculty of Epidemiology & Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'From the Faculty of Epidemiology & Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160610,United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Herpes Zoster Vaccine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antiviral Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Herpes Zoster/*complications/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Herpes Zoster Vaccine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuralgia, Postherpetic/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,,2016/06/12 06:00,2017/05/06 06:00,['2016/06/12 06:00'],"['2015/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['WNL.0000000000002808 [pii]', '10.1212/WNL.0000000000002808 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurology. 2016 Jul 5;87(1):94-102. doi: 10.1212/WNL.0000000000002808.

FK866, a selective inhibitor of Nampt, depletes intracellular NAD(+) levels, thereby blocking cellular metabolism and triggering sensitization to other drugs and cell death. Here we characterized the antitumor effects of Nampt inhibition in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated Nampt role in MW cells using both mRNA and protein expression analyses. We have also used loss-of-function approaches to investigate the growth and survival effects of Nampt on MW cells and further tested the anti-MW activity of dual Nampt and BTK inhibition in vitro and in vivo RESULTS: We found that Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia cells exhibit high levels of Nampt compared with normal B cells. Loss of function studies suggested a potential oncogenic role of Nampt in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia cells, and BTK-inhibitor ibrutinib and FK866 resulted in a significant and synergistic anti-Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia cell death, regardless of MYD88 and CXCR4 mutational status. Cell death was associated with: (i) activation of caspase-3, PARP and downregulation of Mcl-1, (ii) enhanced intracellular ATP and NAD(+) depletion, (iii) inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling, and (iv) inhibition of multiple prosurvival signaling pathways. In a murine xenograft Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia model, low-dose combination FK866 and ibrutinib is well tolerated, significantly inhibits tumor growth, and prolongs host survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show intracellular NAD(+) level as crucial for proliferation and survival of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia cells, and provides the mechanistic preclinical rationale for targeting Nampt, either alone or with Ibrutinib, to overcome drug resistance and improve patient outcome in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.

Large-scale investigations of age- and race-based survival trends over time in these patients have not previously been reported. The objective of this study was to investigate whether race- and age-related differences in pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) leukemia and lymphoma survival persist and to what extent these differences have changed over time. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, this study investigated the outcomes of black and white (1975-2012; n = 27,369) and white and Hispanic (1992-2012; n = 20,574) children (0-14 years old) and AYAs (15-39 years old) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Estimates of 5- and 10-year relative survival were compared over time. RESULTS: Trends showed a convergence of survival for white and black children with ALL but a divergence in survival for AYA patients. Hispanic children and AYAs both suffered inferior outcomes. Trends for AML revealed persistent survival differences between black and white children and suggested worsening disparities for AYAs. Survival trends in HL revealed sustained survival differences between black and white AYA patients, whereas no differences were found in Hispanic and white patient outcomes for AML or HL. CONCLUSIONS: Although survival for children and AYAs with ALL, AML, and HL has improved over the past 4 decades, differences persist between black, white, and Hispanic children and AYAs; survival disparities between black and white children with ALL have been nearly eliminated. Strategies aimed at identifying causality and reducing disparities are warranted. Cancer 2016. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society. Cancer 2016;122:2723-2730.

In countries with high baseline seroprevalence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) such as India, it may be an important pathogen leading to fever, end-organ damage, and cytopenia. Data regarding the incidence and manifestations of CMV disease in pediatric ALL patients are scanty. The authors prospectively assessed all children on chemotherapy for ALL with prolonged febrile neutropenia (FN) for CMV disease over a 3-year period. Children with end-organ damage, including pneumonia, retinitis, and colitis, were also evaluated. Quantitative and qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from blood, body fluids, or tissue was done along with ophthalmologic evaluation. CMV disease was detected in 10% of the children with prolonged FN. In addition, other children were identified due to end-organ damage, lung and eye being the common organs of involvement. Time of CMV reactivation was essentially during nonintense phase of chemotherapy. Lymphopenia was present in most children, and prolonged lymphopenia was associated with relapse of CMV infection after therapy. The authors conclude that CMV is an important pathogen in children on standard chemotherapy for ALL. It has a good outcome with early detection and directed therapy. Parenteral ganciclovir is needed for a period of 14-21 days to prevent recurrence.","['Jain, Richa', 'Trehan, Amita', 'Mishra, Baijyantimala', 'Singh, Ramandeep', 'Saud, Bhuvan', 'Bansal, Deepak']","['Jain R', 'Trehan A', 'Mishra B', 'Singh R', 'Saud B', 'Bansal D']","['a Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics , Advanced Pediatric Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research , Chandigarh , India.', 'a Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics , Advanced Pediatric Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research , Chandigarh , India.', 'b Department of Virology , Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research , Chandigarh , India.', 'c Department of Ophthalmology , Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research , Chandigarh , India.', 'b Department of Virology , Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research , Chandigarh , India.', 'a Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics , Advanced Pediatric Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research , Chandigarh , India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,['P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)'],IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Female', 'Ganciclovir/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/virology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Virus Activation']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'CMV retinitis', 'cytomegalovirus', 'febrile neutropenia', 'ganciclovir']",2016/06/11 06:00,2017/03/31 06:00,['2016/06/11 06:00'],"['2016/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2016.1173147 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2016 May;33(4):239-47. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2016.1173147.,10.3109/08880018.2016.1173147 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we analyzed formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded tumor samples from first diagnosis, relapsed or refractory disease from 28 patients using next-generation sequencing of the exons of 104 coding genes. Non-synonymous mutations were present in 74 of the 104 genes tested. Primary tumor samples showed a median of 8 non-synonymous mutations (range: 0-24) with the used gene set. Lower numbers of non-synonymous mutations in the primary tumor were associated with a better median OS compared with higher numbers (28 versus 15 months, p=0.031). We observed three patterns of clonal evolution during relapse of disease: large global change, subclonal selection and no or minimal change possibly suggesting preprogrammed resistance. We conclude that targeted re-sequencing is a feasible and informative approach to characterize the molecular pattern of relapse and it creates novel insights into the role of dynamics of individual genes.","['Melchardt, Thomas', 'Hufnagl, Clemens', 'Weinstock, David M', 'Kopp, Nadja', 'Neureiter, Daniel', 'Trankenschuh, Wolfgang', 'Hackl, Hubert', 'Weiss, Lukas', 'Rinnerthaler, Gabriel', 'Hartmann, Tanja N', 'Greil, Richard', 'Weigert, Oliver', 'Egle, Alexander']","['Melchardt T', 'Hufnagl C', 'Weinstock DM', 'Kopp N', 'Neureiter D', 'Trankenschuh W', 'Hackl H', 'Weiss L', 'Rinnerthaler G', 'Hartmann TN', 'Greil R', 'Weigert O', 'Egle A']","['Third Medical Department at The Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute (SCRI), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg (CCS), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Third Medical Department at The Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute (SCRI), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg (CCS), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Institute of Pathology, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Institute of Pathology, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Division of Bioinformatics, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Third Medical Department at The Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute (SCRI), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg (CCS), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Third Medical Department at The Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute (SCRI), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg (CCS), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Third Medical Department at The Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute (SCRI), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg (CCS), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Third Medical Department at The Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute (SCRI), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg (CCS), Salzburg, Austria.', 'University Hospital of The Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Medical Department III, Laboratory for Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research (ELLF), Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Third Medical Department at The Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute (SCRI), Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg (CCS), Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Clonal Evolution/*genetics', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Mutation Rate', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics/*pathology', 'Treatment Failure', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['DLBCL', 'TP53', 'clonal evolution', 'subclonal selection', 'tumor heterogeneity']",2016/06/11 06:00,2018/02/07 06:00,['2016/06/11 06:00'],"['2015/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['9860 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9860 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 9;7(32):51494-51502. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9860.,10.18632/oncotarget.9860 [doi],,PMC5239491,"['The authors declare that they have no competing interests with regard to the', 'content discussed in the manuscript.

Chronic phase CML is caused by BCR-ABL1. What additional mutation(s) cause transition to acute phase is unknown and may differ in different persons with CML. BCL11A encodes a transcription factor and is aberrantly-expressed in several haematological and solid neoplasms. We analyzed BCL11A mRNA levels in subjects with chronic and acute phase CML. BCL11A transcript levels were increased in subjects with CML in acute phase compared with those in normals and in subjects in chronic phase including some subjects studied in both phases. BCL11A mRNA levels were correlated with percent bone marrow blasts and significantly higher in lymphoid versus myeloid blast crisis. Differentiation of K562 with butyric acid, a CML cell line, decreased BCL11A mRNA levels. Cytology and flow cytometry analyses showed that ectopic expression of BCL11A in K562 cells blocked differentiation.

In this study, we demonstrated that down-regulation of miR-33a-3p in human primary hepatocellular cancer (HCC) specimens was significantly associated with metastases and poor survival. Over-expression of miR-33a-3p in HepG2 cells remarkably suppressed not only cell growth, migration and invasion, but also tumor growth and metastases in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, and down-regulated Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Homeobox 3 (PBX3) expression. Conversely, inhibition of miR-33a-3p in Bel-7402 cells resulted in increased of cell growth, spreading and invasion. Furthermore, rescue experiments by over-expression PBX3 completely eliminated the inhibitory effects of miR-33a-3p on tumor growth and metastasis, both in vitro and in vivo. The luciferase assay showed that 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of PBX3 were inhibited significantly by miR-33a-3p, while mutations in the miR-33a-3p pairing residues rescued the luciferase expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-33a-3p suppressed the malignant phenotype while also inhibiting PBX3 expression in hepatocellular cancer, implying that miR-33a-3p may be a promising biomarkers and therapy target for HCC intervention.","['Han, Shu-Yan', 'Han, Hai-Bo', 'Tian, Xiu-Yun', 'Sun, Hong', 'Xue, Dong', 'Zhao, Can', 'Jiang, Shan-Tong', 'He, Xi-Ran', 'Zheng, Wen-Xian',

Today, the AML phenotype-genotype associations, that is, FAB/WHO (French-American-British/World Health Organization) definitions and recurrent molecular mutations, are not fully understood. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of molecular mutations on the AML differentiation stage by molecular profiling of 4373 adult de novo AML patients in 7 cytomorphological subtypes. We investigated mutations in 20 genes, including myeloid transcription factors (CEBPA, RUNX1), tumor suppressors (TP53, WT1), DNA modifiers (DNMT3A, IDH1/2, TET2), chromatin modifiers (ASXL1, MLL), signal transduction genes (FLT3, KRAS, NRAS) and NPM1. The most frequently mutated genes per cytomorphological subtype were RUNX1 in M0 (43%), NPM1 in M1 (42%), DNMT3A in M2 (26%), NPM1 in M4 (57%), M5a (49%) and M5b (70%) and TP53 in M6 (36%). Although some gene mutations were frequent in several cytomorphological subtypes, a series of associations of co-occurring mutations with distinct phenotypes were identified for molecularly defined subcohorts. FLT3, NPM1 and WT1 mutations were associated with an immature phenotype in myeloblastic AML, whereas other combinations involving ASXL1, RUNX1, MLL-PTD, CEBPA or KRAS were more frequent in myeloblastic AML with maturation. Within the NPM1 mutated subcohort, ASXL1 mutations were significantly associated with a monoblastic differentiation and DNMT3A mutations with a monocytic phenotype.","['Rose, D', 'Haferlach, T', 'Schnittger, S', 'Perglerova, K', 'Kern, W', 'Haferlach, C']","['Rose D', 'Haferlach T', 'Schnittger S', 'Perglerova K', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach C']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL2 s.r.o., Prague, Czech Republic.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160610,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocyte-Macrophage Precursor Cells', 'Monocytes', '*Mutation', 'Mutation Rate', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/06/11 06:00,2017/08/31 06:00,['2016/06/11 06:00'],"['2016/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016163 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.163 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Jan;31(1):11-17. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.163.

Here we present a protocol for screening of a heptamer-type sgRNA library for potential therapeutic drugs against blood cancers. The protocol includes how to construct the sgRNA library, how to assess the effect of each sgRNA on cell viability, and how to further evaluate the effective sgRNAs by flow cytometry.

The three isoforms of Pim protein appear largely redundant in their oncogenic functions. Thus, a pan-Pim kinase inhibitor is highly desirable. However, cell active pan-Pim inhibitors have proven difficult to develop because Pim-2 has a low Km for ATP and therefore requires a very potent inhibitor to effectively block the kinase activity at cellular ATP concentrations. Herein, we report a series of quinazolinone-pyrrolopyrrolones as potent and selective pan-Pim inhibitors. In particular, compound 17 is orally efficacious in a mouse xenograft model (KMS-12 BM) of multiple myeloma, with 93% tumor growth inhibition at 50 mg/kg QD upon oral dosing.","['Pettus, Liping H',

The tumor suppressor TP53 maps to this region, and its loss or mutation accelerates CLL progression, hampers response to chemotherapy and shortens survival. Although florescent in situ hybridization analyses for 17p deletions are routinely performed during clinical diagnoses, p53 mutational status is often unexamined. Given the limited clinical data that exists for frontline treatment of patients with CLL harboring TP53 mutations, there is a need to understand the biology of CLL with TP53 mutations and identify treatment strategies for this subset of patients. Herein, we used a CLL mouse model (Emu-TCL1) harboring one of the most common TP53 hot-spot mutations observed in CLL (p53(R172H), corresponding to p53(R175H) in humans) to evaluate its impact on disease progression, survival, response to therapy and loss of the remaining wild-type Trp53 allele following ibrutinib treatment. We show that ibrutinib was effective in increasing survival, activating cellular programs outside the p53 pathway and did not place selective pressure on the remaining wild-type Trp53 allele. These data provide evidence that ibrutinib acts as an effective treatment for aggressive forms of CLL with TP53 mutations.","['Lee, H J', 'Gallardo, M', 'Ma, H', 'Zhang, X', 'Larsson, C A', 'Mejia, A', 'Hornbaker, M J', 'Qi, Y', 'Su, X', 'Pageon, L R', 'Quintas-Cardama, A', 'Post, S M']","['Lee HJ', 'Gallardo M', 'Ma H', 'Zhang X', 'Larsson CA', 'Mejia A', 'Hornbaker MJ', 'Qi Y', 'Su X', 'Pageon LR', 'Quintas-Cardama A', 'Post SM']","['Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160610,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Angiopoietin-1)', '0 (Angpt1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Angiopoietin-1', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Piperidines', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2016/06/11 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/06/11 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201641 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2016.41 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2016 Jun 10;6:e434. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2016.41.,10.1038/bcj.2016.41 [doi],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5141356,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient was initially referred for a surgical evaluation. Meanwhile, he developed fevers, pancytopenia, and worsening back pain, and a subsequent spinal MRI revealed a heterogeneous bone marrow signal suspicious for metastatic disease. A bone marrow biopsy that followed was diffusely necrotic. A core biopsy of the patient's liver mass was then performed and was diagnostic of acute monocytic-monoblastic leukemia. Findings from peripheral flow cytometry and a repeat bone marrow biopsy were also consistent with this diagnosis, and induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and idarubicin was initiated.

Nevertheless, Metformin also inhibits mitochondrial electron transport at complex I in an AMPK-independent manner, Here we report that Metformin and rotenone inhibit mitochondrial electron transport and increase triglyceride levels in leukemia cell lines, suggesting impairment of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). We also report that, like other FAO inhibitors, both agents and the related biguanide, Phenformin, increase sensitivity to apoptosis induction by the bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 supporting the notion that electron transport antagonizes activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in leukemia cells. Both biguanides and rotenone induce superoxide generation in leukemia cells, indicating that oxidative damage may sensitize toABT-737 induced apoptosis. In addition, we demonstrate that Metformin sensitizes leukemia cells to the oligomerization of Bak, suggesting that the observed synergy with ABT-737 is mediated, at least in part, by enhanced outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Notably, Phenformin was at least 10-fold more potent than Metformin in abrogating electron transport and increasing sensitivity to ABT-737, suggesting that this agent may be better suited for targeting hematological malignancies. Taken together, our results suggest that inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism by Metformin or Phenformin is associated with increased leukemia cell susceptibility to induction of intrinsic apoptosis, and provide a rationale for clinical studies exploring the efficacy of combining biguanides with the orally bioavailable derivative of ABT-737, Venetoclax.","['Velez, Juliana', 'Pan, Rongqing', 'Lee, Jason T C', 'Enciso, Leonardo', 'Suarez, Marta', 'Duque, Jorge Eduardo', 'Jaramillo, Daniel', 'Lopez, Catalina', 'Morales, Ludis', 'Bornmann, William', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Krystal, Gerald', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Samudio, Ismael']","['Velez J', 'Pan R', 'Lee JT', 'Enciso L', 'Suarez M', 'Duque JE', 'Jaramillo D', 'Lopez C', 'Morales L', 'Bornmann W', 'Konopleva M', 'Krystal G', 'Andreeff M', 'Samudio I']","['Grupo de Terapia Celular y Molecular, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Programa de Investigacion e Innovacion en Leucemia Aguda y Cronica (PILAC), Bogota, Colombia.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Programa de Investigacion e Innovacion en Leucemia Aguda y Cronica (PILAC), Bogota, Colombia.', 'Programa de Investigacion e Innovacion en Leucemia Aguda y Cronica (PILAC), Bogota, Colombia.', 'Centro Oncologico de Antioquia, Medellin, Colombia.', 'Grupo de Terapia Celular y Molecular, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Grupo de Terapia Regenerativa, Universidad de Caldas, Manizales, Colombia.', 'Grupo de Terapia Celular y Molecular, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Grupo de Terapia Celular y Molecular, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Programa de Investigacion e Innovacion en Leucemia Aguda y Cronica (PILAC), Bogota, Colombia.', 'Centre for Drug Research and Development, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biguanides)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)', 'DD5K7529CE (Phenformin)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biguanides/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Electron Transport/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Metformin/pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Phenformin/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Rotenone/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['ABT 737', 'leukemia', 'metformin', 'mitochondria', 'phenformin']",2016/06/11 06:00,2018/02/07 06:00,['2016/06/11 06:00'],"['2016/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['9843 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9843 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 9;7(32):51435-51449. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9843.,10.18632/oncotarget.9843 [doi],"['P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5239486,['The authors declare that they have not conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosing AL requires bone marrow puncture procedure, which many patients do not consent to for it is invasive. Hence sensitive and specific early diagnostic biomarkers are essential for non-invasive diagnosis, new therapeutics and improving the disease prognosis. To differentiate the metabolic alterations associated with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), we investigated serum of ALL and AML patients in comparison with two controls using gas chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis. Twenty seven out of 1425 metabolites were found differentiative among ALL, AML, aplastic anaemia (APA) patients and healthy control using p-value </= 0.001. ALL is the most dissimilar group from other three groups as in hierarchical clustering showed 72.1% dissimilarity. Model generation using PLSDA gave an overall accuracy of 91.9%. This study helps in metabolic fingerprinting of control and disease serum at high significance levels and could be used for early diagnosing of AL. Based on pathways analysis, fatty acid metabolism is deregulated in patients with AL and may represent an underlying metabolic pathway associated with disease progression.

Combined morphologic and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that both lymphoblasts and myeloid cells harbored t(8;22)(p11.2;q11.2); but only lymphoblasts carried the additional der(22)t(8;22).

However, given that prolonged monotherapy tends to beget resistance, we sought to investigate the means by which resistance to ABT-199 might arise in AML and the extent to which those mechanisms might be preempted. Here we used a pathway-activating genetic screen to nominate MCL-1 and BCL-XL as potential nodes of resistance. We then characterized a panel of ABT-199-resistant myeloid leukemia cell lines derived through chronic exposure to ABT-199 and found that acquired drug resistance is indeed driven by the upregulation of MCL-1 and BCL-XL. By targeting MCL-1 and BCL-XL, resistant AML cell lines could be resensitized to ABT-199. Further, preemptively targeting MCL-1 and/or BCL-XL alongside administration of ABT-199 was capable of delaying or forestalling the acquisition of drug resistance. Collectively, these data suggest that in AML, (1) the selection of initial therapy dynamically templates the landscape of acquired resistance via modulation of MCL-1/BCL-XL and (2) appropriate selection of initial therapy may delay or altogether forestall the acquisition of resistance to ABT-199.","['Lin, Kevin H', 'Winter, Peter S', 'Xie, Abigail', 'Roth, Cullen', 'Martz, Colin A', 'Stein, Elizabeth M', 'Anderson, Grace R', 'Tingley, Jennifer P', 'Wood, Kris C']","['Lin KH', 'Winter PS', 'Xie A', 'Roth C', 'Martz CA', 'Stein EM', 'Anderson GR', 'Tingley JP', 'Wood KC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Program in Genetics and Genomics, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Program in Genetics and Genomics, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20160610,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/06/11 06:00,2018/05/23 06:00,['2016/06/11 06:00'],"['2015/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['srep27696 [pii]', '10.1038/srep27696 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Jun 10;6:27696. doi: 10.1038/srep27696.,10.1038/srep27696 [doi],"['F30 CA206348/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA195967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007171/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007754/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4901329,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific KMT2A fusion partners are associated with the disease phenotype (lymphoblastic vs. myeloid), and the type of KMT2A rearrangement also has prognostic implications. However, the KMT2A partner gene cannot always be identified by banding karyotyping. We sought to identify such partner genes in 13 cases of childhood leukemia with uninformative karyotypes by combining molecular techniques, including multicolor banding FISH, reverse-transcriptase PCR, and long-distance inverse PCR. Of the KMT2A fusion partner genes, MLLT3 was present in five patients, all with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, MLLT1 in two patients, and MLLT10, MLLT4, MLLT11, and AFF1 in one patient each. Reciprocal reading by long-distance inverse PCR also disclosed KMT2A fusions with PITPNA in one patient, with LOC100132273 in another patient, and with DNA sequences not compatible with any gene in three patients. The most common KMT2A breakpoint region was intron/exon 9 (3/8 patients), followed by intron/exon 11 and 10.

We conclude that the combination of molecular techniques used in this study can efficiently identify KMT2A fusion partners in complex pediatric acute leukemia karyotypes.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of TP53 c.213 G>C(Arg72Pro; rs1042522) polymorphism on CML risk and its correlation with clinical outcome. Peripheral blood samples from 141 treated CML patients and 141 sex- and age-matched healthy individuals were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. Standard genetic models for disease penetrance were evaluated by logistic regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier method was performed to estimate survival curves. Our study suggests that TP53 c.213 G>C polymorphism may be involved in CML development considering a recessive model (p=0.01; OR: 0.19; CI: 0.06-0.68). In addition, a non-homogenous distribution was found for this polymorphism in males and patients youngers than 50years (p=0.02). According to clinical response, TP53-GG genotype was associated with higher levels of BCR-ABL1 transcripts (p=0.04) and shorter event free survival (p=0.04). Moreover, a trend toward significance was found for failure free survival (p=0.06) and time to imatinib failure (p=0.08). In conclusion, our data suggest that a;TP53 c.213 G>C may be a potential biomarker of CML susceptibility and clinical outcome.","['Weich, Natalia', 'Ferri, Cristian', 'Moiraghi, Beatriz', 'Bengio, Raquel', 'Giere, Isabel', 'Pavlovsky, Carolina', 'Larripa, Irene', 'Fundia, Ariela']","['Weich N', 'Ferri C', 'Moiraghi B', 'Bengio R', 'Giere I', 'Pavlovsky C', 'Larripa I', 'Fundia A']","['Laboratorio de Genetica Hematologica, IMEX, CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica Hematologica, IMEX, CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Ramos Mejia, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Departamento de Hemato-oncologia, Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'FUNDALEU, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'FUNDALEU, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica Hematologica, IMEX, CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Genetica Hematologica, IMEX, CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

So, it gives important feedback about conventional treatment success and helps in selecting therapeutic alternatives. We aimed to compare the expression of CD34/CD123 on normal B-cell precursors in bone marrow (""hematogones"") and on leukemic blasts in B-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL) pediatric cases by flowcytometric analysis. Our study conducted on 20 children as a control and 30 B-ALL children cases at diagnosis and after 28days of induction therapy. We found that the less mature hematogones (dim CD45+) that express CD34 lack CD123 expression, whereas the more mature hematogones (moderate CD45+) lack CD34 but always express CD123. In contrast with this discordant pattern of CD34 and CD123 expression in hematogones, blasts in 24 of 30 cases (80%) of B-ALL showed concordant expression pattern of the 2 antigens: 63% (19 of 30) cases expressed both antigens, whereas 17% (5 of 30) expressed neither. Our study concluded that these distinct patterns of CD34/CD123 expression on hematogones (discordant) and B-ALL blasts (concordant) are useful in differentiating small populations of residual blasts from hematogones after induction therapy to detect MRD.","['Zeidan, Magda A', 'Kamal, Howyda M', 'El Shabrawy, Deena A', 'Esh, Asmaa M H', 'Sattar, Reeham H Abdel-']","['Zeidan MA', 'Kamal HM', 'El Shabrawy DA', 'Esh AM', 'Sattar RH']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Benha, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Benha, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Benha, Egypt.

We determined the expression of cholinergic components in leukemic cell lines by Western blotting and in normal leukocyte subsets by flow cytometry and found a heterogeneous expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline transporter (CHT), M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3-mAChR) and alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7-nAChR). We then evaluated NNCS role in differentiation of human NB-4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line and discovered a dramatic induction of M3-mAChR after all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment (p<0.0001). Adding carbachol which is a cholinergic agonist to the ATRA treatment resulted in an increase of a granulocytic differentiation marker (CD11b) as compared with ATRA treatment alone (p<0.05), indicating that cholinergic activation enhanced ATRA in inducing NB-4 maturation. The combination of carbachol and ATRA treatment for 72h also resulted in decreased viability and increased cleaved caspase-3 expression when compared with ATRA treatment alone (p<0.05). However, this combination did not cause poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Overall, we have shown that NB-4 cells expressed M3-mAChR in a differentiation-dependent manner and cholinergic stimulation induced maturation and death of ATRA-induced differentiated NB-4 cells.","['Chotirat, Sadudee', 'Suriyo, Tawit', 'Hokland, Marianne', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Satayavivad, Jutamaad', 'Auewarakul, Chirayu U']","['Chotirat S', 'Suriyo T', 'Hokland M', 'Hokland P', 'Satayavivad J', 'Auewarakul CU']","['Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok 10700, Thailand.

Then G-CSF, AMD3100 and cytarabine were added. Adhesive rate, SDF-1 level, migration state, apoptosis rate, and cell cycle of leukemia cells were observed after incubation at 24h and 48h. RESULTS: G-CSF decreased the level of SDF-1 and inhibited the expression of CXCR4 and promoted stationary phase leukemia cells to enter the mitotic phase and enhanced the killing effect of chemotherapeutic drugs. AMD3100 disrupted the interaction between tumors and matrix, mobilized the leukemia cells to keep away from the protective microenvironment and strengthened the cytotoxic effect of Ara-C. The combination of G-CSF and AMD3100 had stronger effects on killing the leukemia cells induced by Ara-C. CONCLUSION: It demonstrates that AMD3100 and G-CSF may inhibit adhesion and migration abilities of leukemia cells with the bone marrow niche. Both of them inhibit the role of SDF-1/CXCR4 directly or indirectly. Thus inhibiting SDF-1/CXCR4 axis may be helpful to the treatment of refractory AML.","['Shen, Zhao-Hua', 'Zeng, Dong-Feng', 'Kong, Pei-Yan', 'Ma, Ying-Ying', 'Zhang, Xi']","['Shen ZH', 'Zeng DF', 'Kong PY', 'Ma YY', 'Zhang X']","[""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, The Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, The Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, The Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400037, People's Republic of China.

We found that in small cell B-cell lymphomas, EZH2 is expressed in <40% of neoplastic cells, with heterogenous signal intensity. In aggressive B-cell lymphomas, 70-100% of tumor cells were positive for EZH2 expression with high signal intensity, which correlated with a high proliferation rate. We investigated the potential signaling molecules that regulate EZH2 overexpression in aggressive B-cell lymphomas and found that 80% of cases of EZH2-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma show high p-ERK1/2 expression (average ~57% tumor cell positivity). In contrast, only a small percentage of tumor cells (~10%) show p-ERK1/2 expression in Burkitt lymphoma and double hit lymphoma. On average, 91 and 76% of neoplastic cells were positive for MYC expression in Burkitt lymphoma and double hit lymphoma, respectively, while only 20% neoplastic cells were positive for MYC expression in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. None of the aggressive B-cell lymphomas showed significant p-STAT3 expression in EZH2-overexpressed cases. The correlation of EZH2 expression with aggressive behavior and proliferation rate in B-cell neoplasms suggests that this molecule may function as an oncogenic protein in these neoplasms, with possible regulation by different signaling cascades in different types of aggressive B-cell lymphomas: p-ERK-related signaling in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and MYC-related signaling in Burkitt lymphoma and double hit lymphoma. Furthermore, EZH2 and associated signaling cascades may serve as therapeutic targets for the treatment of aggressive B-cell lymphomas.","['Tian, Xuejun', 'Pelton, Ashley', 'Shahsafaei, Ali', 'Dorfman, David M']","['Tian X', 'Pelton A', 'Shahsafaei A', 'Dorfman DM']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160610,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*analysis', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/*analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*analysis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2016/06/11 06:00,2018/01/24 06:00,['2016/06/11 06:00'],"['2016/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2016114 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2016.114 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2016 Sep;29(9):1050-7. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2016.114.

Acquired resistance has been identified in a sub-population of patients in which mutations affecting BTK predominantly substitute cysteine 481 in the kinase domain for catalytically active serine, thereby ablating covalent binding of inhibitors. Activating substitutions in the BTK substrate phospholipase Cgamma2 (PLCgamma2) instead confers resistance independent of BTK. Herein, we generated all six possible amino acid substitutions due to single nucleotide alterations for the cysteine 481 codon, in addition to threonine, requiring two nucleotide substitutions, and performed functional analysis. Replacement by arginine, phenylalanine, tryptophan or tyrosine completely inactivated the catalytic activity, whereas substitution with glycine caused severe impairment. BTK with threonine replacement was catalytically active, similar to substitution with serine. We identify three potential ibrutinib resistance scenarios for cysteine 481 replacement: (1) Serine, being catalytically active and therefore predominating among patients. (2) Threonine, also being catalytically active, but predicted to be scarce, because two nucleotide changes are needed. (3) As BTK variants replaced with other residues are catalytically inactive, they presumably need compensatory mutations, therefore being very scarce. Glycine and tryptophan variants were not yet reported but likely also provide resistance.","['Hamasy, A', 'Wang, Q', 'Blomberg, K E M', 'Mohammad, D K', 'Yu, L', 'Vihinen, M', 'Berglof, A', 'Smith, C I E']","['Hamasy A', 'Wang Q', 'Blomberg KE', 'Mohammad DK', 'Yu L', 'Vihinen M', 'Berglof A', 'Smith CI']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', ""Department of Hematology, Huai'an First People's Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160525,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', '*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Biocatalysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Threonine', 'Transfection']",,,2016/06/11 06:00,2017/08/31 06:00,['2016/06/11 06:00'],"['2015/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016153 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.153 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Jan;31(1):177-185. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.153.

Using high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, we identified recurrent deletions of the SETD2 locus in 3% (8/261) of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients. Further validation in two independent cohorts showed that SETD2 deletions were associated with loss of TP53, genomic complexity and chromothripsis. With next-generation sequencing we detected mutations of SETD2 in an additional 3.8% of patients (23/602). In most cases, SETD2 deletions or mutations were often observed as a clonal event and always as a mono-allelic lesion, leading to reduced mRNA expression in SETD2-disrupted cases. Patients with SETD2 abnormalities and wild-type TP53 and ATM from five clinical trials employing chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy had reduced progression-free and overall survival compared with cases wild type for all three genes. Consistent with its postulated role as a tumour suppressor, our data highlight SETD2 aberration as a recurrent, early loss-of-function event in CLL pathobiology linked to aggressive

It is the first cancer directly associated with a genetic abnormality. Specifically, it is associated to a particular cytogenetic abnormality, known as Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), which results from a fusion between part of the BCR (""breakpoint cluster region"") gene from chromosome 22 and the Abelson (ABL) gene on chromosome 9 and leads to the formation a new gene leukemia-specific, the BCR-ABL. Since 2011, there are several tyrosine-kinase inhibitors in the market. Due to mutations in the tyrosine-kinase domain, these inhibitors are becoming less effective in the leukemia treatment, and then there is a need for new more effective inhibitors. METHODS: The aim of this work is to obtain new tyrosine-kinase inhibitors using in silico tools like de novo drug design, docking and absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion studies. RESULTS: Using the proposed methodology, an initial library of more than 6000 molecules was obtained. This library was then filtered out using the Tanimoto metric to compute the similarity between the molecules using as parameter the 2D linear hashed fingerprint with a 64-bit address space. The resulting library was then used to run docking studies together with the reference market drugs and their ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) properties were determined. Three compounds with better inhibition capacity and better ADME properties that the commercially available not only for the wild form of enzymes under study but also to its mutated forms were obtained. CONCLUSION: The fragment based drug design method used in this work turns to be a good alternative to create new drugs that can control this neoplasm. Based on the calculated GScore, the de novo designed molecules have better inhibitor capacity than the tyrosine-kinase inhibitors most used in the market. These molecules shown strong potential to become drugs capable to inhibit all mutations, mainly the T315I mutation, now the leading cause of deaths due to the difficulty of inhibitors to control it.","['Pereira, Washington', 'Camps, Ihosvany']","['Pereira W', 'Camps I']","['Laboratorio de Modelagem Computacional-LaModel, Instituto de Ciencias Exatas-ICEx.

Prednisolone exerts its effect by induce apoptosis in lymphoid lineage cells. Micro RNAs are 18-24 nucleotides RNA implicated in the control of essential biological functions, including apoptosis. In the following study, the effect of prednisolone on the expression of miR 15a & miR16-1 and apoptosis in the CCRF-CEM cell line is investigated. METHODS: The cell line of CCRF-CEM was cultured in standard conditions. The changes in the miR 15a and miR 16-1 expression levels were determined by Real Time-PCR technique. Also, the apoptosis is evaluated by flow cytometry using Annexin V and PI staining. RESULTS: This study revealed that, the prednisolone induced apoptosis in a time dependent manner. Prednisolone in concentration of 700 microM was significantly increased the expression of miR 16-1 and miR 15a after 24 h and 48 h treatment (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: prednisolone-induced apoptosis might be mediated by up-regulation of these 2 miRNAs in CCRF-CEM cells.","['Azimi, A', 'Hagh, M F', 'Yousefi, B', 'Rahnama, M A', 'Khorrami, A', 'Heydarabad, M Z', 'Najafpour, M', 'Hallajzadeh, J', 'Ghahremani, A']","['Azimi A', 'Hagh MF', 'Yousefi B', 'Rahnama MA', 'Khorrami A', 'Heydarabad MZ', 'Najafpour M', 'Hallajzadeh J', 'Ghahremani A']","['Department of Basic Sciences, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Medical Biotechnology Research Center, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160609,Germany,Drug Res (Stuttg),Drug research,101602406,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prednisolone/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2016/06/10 06:00,2017/03/07 06:00,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0042-108640 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Res (Stuttg). 2016 Aug;66(8):432-5. doi: 10.1055/s-0042-108640.

Alongside the tutorial, we provide easy-to-use functions in the statistics package R. We argue that this multi-state modeling approach using a package such as R has advantages over approaches where models are built in a spreadsheet package. In particular, using a syntax-based approach means there is a written record of what was done and the calculations are transparent. Reproducing the analysis is straightforward as the syntax just needs to be run again. The approach can be thought of as an alternative way to build a Markov decision-analytic model, which also has the option to use a state-arrival extended approach. In the state-arrival extended multi-state model, a covariate that represents patients' history is included, allowing the Markov property to be tested. We illustrate the building of multi-state survival models, making predictions from the models and assessing fits. We then proceed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis, including deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Finally, we show how to create 2 common methods of visualizing the results-namely, cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. The analysis is implemented entirely within R. It is based on adaptions to functions in the existing R package mstate to accommodate parametric multi-state modeling that facilitates extrapolation of survival curves.","['Williams, Claire', 'Lewsey, James D', 'Briggs, Andrew H', 'Mackay, Daniel F']","['Williams C', 'Lewsey JD', 'Briggs AH', 'Mackay DF']","['Health Economics and Health Technology Assessment, Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK (CW, JDL, AHB).', 'Health Economics and Health Technology Assessment, Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK (CW, JDL, AHB).', 'Health Economics and Health Technology Assessment, Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK (CW, JDL, AHB).', 'Public Health, Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK (DFM).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160608,United States,Med Decis Making,Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,8109073,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis/*methods', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality', '*Markov Chains', '*Models, Statistical', 'Probability', '*Survival Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Markov models', '*cost-effectiveness analysis', '*probabilistic sensitivity analysis', '*survival analysis']",2016/06/10 06:00,2018/03/20 06:00,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['0272989X16651869 [pii]', '10.1177/0272989X16651869 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Decis Making. 2017 May;37(4):340-352. doi: 10.1177/0272989X16651869.

Direct inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase has revolutionized disease management, but fails to eradicate leukaemic stem cells (LSCs), which maintain CML. LSCs are independent of BCR-ABL for survival, providing a rationale for identifying and targeting kinase-independent pathways. Here we show--using proteomics, transcriptomics and network analyses--that in human LSCs, aberrantly expressed proteins, in both imatinib-responder and non-responder patients, are modulated in concert with p53 (also known as TP53) and c-MYC regulation. Perturbation of both p53 and c-MYC, and not BCR-ABL itself, leads to synergistic cell kill, differentiation, and near elimination of transplantable human LSCs in mice, while sparing normal HSCs. This unbiased systems approach targeting connected nodes exemplifies a novel precision medicine strategy providing evidence that LSCs can be eradicated.","['Abraham, Sheela A', 'Hopcroft, Lisa E M',

However, the genetic basis for the immune escape has not been fully elucidated, with the exception of elevated PD-L1 expression by gene amplification and utilization of an ectopic promoter by translocation, as reported in Hodgkin and other B-cell lymphomas, as well as stomach adenocarcinoma. Here we show a unique genetic mechanism of immune escape caused by structural variations (SVs) commonly disrupting the 3' region of the PD-L1 gene. Widely affecting multiple common human cancer types, including adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (27%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (8%), and stomach adenocarcinoma (2%), these SVs invariably lead to a marked elevation of aberrant PD-L1 transcripts that are stabilized by truncation of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Disruption of the Pd-l1 3'-UTR in mice enables immune evasion of EG7-OVA tumour cells with elevated Pd-l1 expression in vivo, which is effectively inhibited by Pd-1/Pd-l1 blockade, supporting the role of relevant SVs in clonal selection through immune evasion. Our findings not only unmask a novel regulatory mechanism of PD-L1 expression, but also suggest that PD-L1 3'-UTR disruption could serve as a genetic marker to identify cancers that actively evade anti-tumour immunity through PD-L1 overexpression.","['Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Takeda, Yohei', 'Sakata, Seiji', 'Matsumoto, Misako', 'Nagano, Seiji', 'Maeda, Takuya', 'Nagata,

At present, hematological malignancies are analyzed and classified on the basis of morphologic characteristics, cell surface markers, cytogenetic aberrations and molecular markers. Unfortunately, in most cases, standard criteria are not sufficient for both an early diagnosis and a complete classification. The latter issue hampers an optimal therapeutic choice for these patients that often display heterogeneous clinical outcomes or responses to therapy. This heterogeneity has determined a need for improved methods of analysis and novel markers for diagnosis and classification of these malignancies. Non coding RNAs act as master regulators of numerous biological processes including epigenetic response, apoptosis and cell cycle. The recent advances in cancer research have led to a spreading out in the clinical use of genomic information; in fact, several studies are investigating the prominent role of both miRNAs and lncRNAs in hematopoietic differentiation and proliferation, as well as in the development of various hematological malignancies. These investigations are mainly aimed at researching new therapeutic opportunities that could boost a reduced risk of adverse events in normal tissues. Moreover, not less important, there is also a growing interest in determining how ncRNAs are associated with clinical features. In this review we focus on the aberrant ncRNAs expression in the most common forms of blood cancers, each of which exhibits a unique signature in comparison to normal counterparts. In addition to their regulatory role and in virtue of the well known ncRNAs&#039; capacity of modulating signal and pathway networks, herein we discuss both miRNAs&#039; and lncRNAs&#039; potential as new powerful biomarkers for efficient diagnosis and prediction of response for patients with hematological malignancies.","['Misso, Gabriella', 'Zarone, Mayra Rachele', 'Grimaldi, Anna', 'Di Martino, Maria Teresa', 'Lombardi, Angela', 'Kawasaki, Hiromichi', 'Stiuso, Paola', 'Tassone, Pierfrancesco', 'Tagliaferri, Pierosandro', 'Caraglia, Michele']","['Misso G', 'Zarone MR', 'Grimaldi A', 'Di Martino MT', 'Lombardi A', 'Kawasaki H', 'Stiuso P', 'Tassone P', 'Tagliaferri P', 'Caraglia M']","['Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics and General Pathology, Second Naples University, Via S.M.

A diagnostic-driven approach has been an alternative to the classical empiric antifungal therapy. In the present study we tested an algorithm that incorporated risk stratification using the D-index, serial serum galactomannan and computed tomographic-scan to guide the decision to start antifungal therapy in neutropenic patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2010 and August 2012, patients with acute leukemia in induction remission were prospectively monitored from day 1 of chemotherapy until discharge or death with the D-index and galactomannan. Patients were stratified in low, intermediate and high risk according to the D-index and an extensive workup for invasive mold disease was performed in case of positive galactomannan (>/=0.5), persistent fever, or the appearance of clinical manifestations suggestive of invasive mold disease. RESULTS: Among 29 patients, 6 (21%), 11 (38%), and 12 (41%) were classified as high, intermediate, and low risk, respectively. Workup for invasive mold disease was undertaken in 67%, 73% and 58% (p=0.77) of patients in each risk category, respectively, and antifungal therapy was given to 67%, 54.5%, and 17% (p=0.07). Proven or probable invasive mold disease was diagnosed in 67%, 45.5%, and in none (p=0.007) of high, intermediate, and low risk patients, respectively. All patients survived. CONCLUSION: A risk stratification using D-index was a useful instrument to be incorporated in invasive mold disease diagnostic approach, resulting in a more comprehensive antifungal treatment strategy, and to guide an earlier start of treatment in afebrile patients under very high risk.","['Garnica, Marcia', 'Sinhorelo, Aline', 'Madeira, Laura', 'Portugal, Rodrigo', 'Nucci, Marcio']","['Garnica M', 'Sinhorelo A', 'Madeira L', 'Portugal R', 'Nucci M']","['Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Hospital Universitario, Departmento de Medicina Interna, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Hospital Universitario, Departmento de Medicina Interna, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Hospital Universitario, Departmento de Medicina Interna, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Hospital Universitario, Departmento de Medicina Interna, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Hospital Universitario, Departmento de Medicina Interna, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

In this study, the role of PADIs in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer was investigated. Specifically, RNA expression was analyzed and its association with survival in a cohort of 98 colorectal cancer patient specimens with matched adjacent mucosa and 50 controls from donors without cancer. Key results were validated in an independent collection of tumors with matched adjacent mucosa and by mining of a publicly available expression data set. Protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting for cell lines or IHC for patient specimens that further included 24 cases of adenocarcinoma with adjacent dysplasia and 11 cases of active ulcerative colitis. The data indicate that PADI2 is the dominantly expressed PADI enzyme in colon mucosa and is upregulated during differentiation. PADI2 expression is low or absent in colorectal cancer. Frequently, this occurs already at the stage of low-grade dysplasia. Mucosal PADI2 expression is also low in ulcerative colitis. The expression level of PADI2 in tumor and adjacent mucosa correlates with differential survival: low levels associate with poor prognosis. IMPLICATIONS: Downregulation of PADI2 is an early event in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer associated with poor prognosis and points toward a possible role of citrullination in modulating tumor cells and their microenvironment.

METHODS: To determine the ex vivo drug resistance profile to anthracyclines, an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) cytotoxicity assay was performed on mononuclear cells obtained from 155 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Gene expression profiles (for 51 patients with ALL and 16 with AML) were prepared on the basis of cRNA hybridization to oligonucleotide arrays of the human genome (Affymetrix). Hierarchical clustering, assignment location and biological function were investigated during the correlation analysis for identified probe sets. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array profiles (34 patients with ALL and 12 with AML) were prepared on the basis of DNA hybridization to oligonucleotide arrays of the human genome (Agilent). The validation of the array results was performed by a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The collected expression and CGH microarray experiment results indicate that the ITGB2, SCL6A7, CASP1 and DUSP genes may comprise a resistance marker for acute leukemia cells correlated with anthracyclines. Moreover, there were also identified chromosome rearrangements associated with drug resistance, such as del5q32-35.3 and amp8p12-p11.21. Precise genes, as well as genome aberrations, might be classified as targets in therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In AML, the resistance of blasts to idarubicin and mitoxantrone may reflect an impaired integrin pathway. In ALL, the development of resistance is caused by the inhibition of B and T cell activation.

Apart from the classical role as tumor suppressor, p53 during steady state hematopoiesis is associated with the maintenance of quiescent cell population in bone marrow by upregulating necdin (Ndn) and Gfi-1. We felt, it is necessary to delineate its attribution towards malignant conversion of hematopoietic system during leukemogenesis from all the possible angles. The present study deals with the characterization of N-N' Ethylnitrosourea (ENU) induced mouse model of leukemia by peripheral blood hemogram, bone marrow cytology, histology, cytochemical staining (MPO) and scanning electron microscopic study. We further investigated the alteration of conventional and hematopoiesis specific p53 pathways by flowcytometric expressional analysis of ATM, Chk-2, p53, p21, Ndn, Gfi-1 and Tie-2. The disruption of classical p53 pathway was observed in leukemic hematopoietic stem/progenitor population which involved downregulation of ATM, Chk-2, p53 and p21. Moreover, the expressional decline of Ndn and Gfi-1 hinted towards the mechanism of hindrance of hematopoietic quiescency in leukemic bone marrow. Increased expression of Tie-2 due to reverse correlation with p53 was found to be responsible for pathological angiogenesis in bone marrow together with increased blast burden in bone marrow during leukemia. The study presents the mechanistic scenario of the alteration of both classical as well as hematopoiesis specific p53 pathways in HSPC compartment triggering leukemic pathophysiology.","['Chatterjee, Ritam', 'Chattopadhyay, Sukalpa', 'Law, Sujata']","['Chatterjee R', 'Chattopadhyay S', 'Law S']","['Stem Cell Research and Application Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology, Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, 108, C.R Avenue, Kolkata 700073, West Bengal, India.', 'Stem Cell Research and Application Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology, Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, 108, C.R Avenue, Kolkata 700073, West Bengal, India.', 'Stem Cell Research and Application Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Medical Biotechnology, Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, 108, C.R Avenue, Kolkata 700073, West Bengal, India.

This has led to the identification of similar cells in other types of cancer. CSCs express distinct surface markers and functional properties which distinguish them from the rest of the cells within a tumor. Due to variability in identification of CSCs in a particular type of cancer (except brain, breast and leukemia), surface markers alone may not be sufficient. It is critical to identify and isolate this small population of cells from the heterogeneous tumors to understand their pathogenesis. Identification of surface markers together with intrinsic properties of CSCs like colony formation, Hoechst exclusion or ALDEFLUOR assay may be useful in isolating more primitive and highly pure CSCs from a heterogeneous population of malignant cells. This review critically analyses various techniques and methods along with their advantages and disadvantages that are employed in identifying CSCs from different types of cancers.","['Nagare, Rohit P', 'Sneha, Smarakan', 'Priya, Syama Krishna', 'Ganesan, Trivadi S']","['Nagare RP', 'Sneha S', 'Priya SK', 'Ganesan TS']","['Laboratory for Cancer Biology, Department of Medical Oncology and Clinical Research, Cancer Institute (W.I.A), 38, Sardar Patel Road, Chennai, Tamilnadu, Pin: 600 036, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,Current stem cell research & therapy,101272517,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Spheroids, Cellular', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2016/06/10 06:00,2017/02/18 06:00,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['CSCRT-EPUB-76363 [pii]', '10.2174/1574888x11666160607211436 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther. 2017;12(1):37-44. doi: 10.2174/1574888x11666160607211436.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression and/or mutations of FLT3 have been shown to occur in the majority of cases of AML. Our analysis of a large-scale AML patient cohort (N = 562) indicates that FLT3 is particularly highly expressed in some subtypes of AML, such as AML with t(11q23)/MLL-rearrangements or FLT3-ITD. Such AML subtypes are known to be associated with unfavorable prognosis. To treat FLT3-overexpressing AML, we developed a novel targeted nanoparticle system: FLT3 ligand (FLT3L)-conjugated G7 poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) nanosized dendriplex encapsulating miR-150, a pivotal tumor suppressor and negative regulator of FLT3 We show that the FLT3L-guided miR-150 nanoparticles selectively and efficiently target FLT3-overexpressing AML cells and significantly inhibit viability/growth and promote apoptosis of the AML cells. Our proof-of-concept animal model studies demonstrate that the FLT3L-guided miR-150 nanoparticles tend to concentrate in bone marrow, and significantly inhibit progression of FLT3-overexpressing AML in vivo, while exhibiting no obvious side effects on normal hematopoiesis. Collectively, we have developed a novel targeted therapeutic strategy, using FLT3L-guided miR-150-based nanoparticles, to treat FLT3-overexpressing AML with high efficacy and minimal side effects.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use and reporting of survival analyses in these articles. METHODS: We performed a systematic review by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases from inception to April 2015. Clinical trials of patients with ALL comparing allo-SCT compared to another treatment were included. We included only studies that used survival analysis as a part of the statistical methods. RESULTS: There were 14 studies included in the review. Sample size estimation was described in 4 (29 %) studies. Only 4 (29 %) studies reported the list of covariates assessed in the Cox regression and 6 (43 %) studies provided a description of censorship. All studies reported survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method. The comparisons between groups were investigated using the log-rank test and Wilcoxon test. Crossing survival curves were observed in 11(79 %) studies. The Cox regression model was incorporated in 10 (71 %) studies. None of the studies assessed the Cox proportional hazards assumption or goodness-of-fit. CONCLUSIONS: The use and reporting of survival analysis in adult ALL patients undergoing allo-SCT have significant limitations. Notably, the finding of crossing survival curves was common and none of the studies assessed for the proportional hazards assumption. We encourage authors, reviewers and editors to improve the quality of the use and reporting of survival analysis in the hematology literature.","['Chai-Adisaksopha, Chatree', 'Iorio, Alfonso', 'Hillis, Christopher', 'Lim, Wendy', 'Crowther, Mark']","['Chai-Adisaksopha C', 'Iorio A', 'Hillis C', 'Lim W', 'Crowther M']","['Departments of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada ; Departments of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.', 'Departments of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada ; Departments of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.', 'Departments of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada ; Departments of Oncology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.', 'Departments of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.', 'Departments of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada ; Departments of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160608,England,BMC Hematol,BMC hematology,101609487,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Mortality', 'Regression analysis', 'Systematic review']",2016/06/10 06:00,2016/06/10 06:01,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2015/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12878-016-0055-7 [doi]', '55 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Hematol. 2016 Jun 8;16:17. doi: 10.1186/s12878-016-0055-7. eCollection 2016.,10.1186/s12878-016-0055-7 [doi],,PMC4898350,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous genome-wide association studies have reported several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the incidence of ALL. Several variations in genes encoding enzymes involved in carcinogenesis are suggested as being associated with an increased risk of ALL development. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We enrolled 77 paediatric ALL patients and 122 healthy controls, and in addition parental DNA was also available for 45 probands. SNPs rs10821936 (ARID5B), rs4132601 (IKZF1), rs2239633 (CEBPE), rs3731217 (CDKN2A) and rs1800566 (NQO1) and the presence of GSTT1 and GSTM1 null variants were detected. For statistical analysis the hybrid method of two designs 'Haplin' was used as well as linkage disequilibrium for family-based association studies. RESULTS: We identified the SNP rs10821936 in the ARID5B gene as being statistically significantly associated with childhood ALL, especially if the C allele is in a homozygous state, relative risk (RR) 4.65, 95% CI: 2.03-10.6, p = 0.0006. Statistically significant differences were not found in other SNPs. We found risk combinations including all five variations, the strongest association being found in a combination where all five genetic variants are in a homozygous state, CCTTTTTTCC, p = 0.032. CONCLUSIONS: The identified SNP rs10821936 could serve as a potential risk marker for childhood ALL development. Further studies in an independent population are needed for verification.","['Kreile, Madara', 'Piekuse, Linda', 'Rots, Dmitrijs', 'Dobele, Zane', 'Kovalova, Zhanna', 'Lace, Baiba']","['Kreile M', 'Piekuse L', 'Rots D', 'Dobele Z', 'Kovalova Z', 'Lace B']","['Scientific Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia; Institute of Oncology, Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia.', 'Scientific Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia.', 'Scientific Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia.', 'Scientific Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Riga Stradins University, Riga, Latvia.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Clinical University Hospital, Riga, Latvia."", 'Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, Riga, Latvia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160518,Poland,Arch Med Sci,Archives of medical science : AMS,101258257,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ARID5B', 'IKZF1', 'childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'single nucleotide polymorphisms']",2016/06/10 06:00,2016/06/10 06:01,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5114/aoms.2016.59920 [doi]', '27561 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Med Sci. 2016 Jun 1;12(3):479-85. doi: 10.5114/aoms.2016.59920.

Despite decades of intensive investigations, effective interventional options are still limited and patient prognosis remains poor. Tanshinone I, an active compound from traditional Chinese herbal medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, has been shown to inhibit cell growth of leukemia, lung, and breast cancers. However, whether and how Tanshinone I exerts similar effects on CRC needs to be elucidated. Tanshinone I induced CRC cell apoptosis was characterized and the roles of Aurora A-p53 and survivin-mediated pathways were analyzed in different CRC cell lines. Tanshinone I markedly inhibited CRC cell growth and induced apoptosis in CRC cells with functional p53 protein. Interestingly, Tanshinone I did not exert as much inhibitory effect on normal colon epithelial cells or CRC cells with mutant p53, indicating relative selectivity toward colorectal cancer cells with full presence of p53. In tse cells with wild-type p53, data showed that Tanshinone I mediated Aurora A inhibition results in p53 upregulation, which is required for cell apoptosis. In CRC cells with mutant p53 protein (not able to localize to the nucleus), however, Aurora A knockdown failed to induce CRC cell apoptosis. Instead, data showed that protein level of survivin decreased following Tanshinone I treatment. These observations were further substantiated by the pivotal role of survivin in Tanshinone I mediated apoptosis in CRC cells with p53 mutant. Tanshinone I, a novel natural compound, exerts significant inhibitory effect on CRC cell growth via a mechanism involving either Aurora A-p53 axis or survivin-involving mechanism depending on different intrinsic characteristics of tumor cells.","['Lu, Mingjie', 'Wang, Chen', 'Wang, Jian']","['Lu M', 'Wang C', 'Wang J']","['Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210029, P.R.

Patients received imatinib mesylate in a dose of 400 mg daily. Over an average period of 3 months, well defined hyperpigmented macules appeared over the convexities of the face. One of the patients also developed similar pigmentation on the forearm. Other causes of hyperpigmentation were excluded in each patient.","['Ghunawat, Sneha', 'Sarkar, Rashmi', 'Garg, Vijay Kumar']","['Ghunawat S', 'Sarkar R', 'Garg VK']","['Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprosy, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprosy, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprosy, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, India.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],,United States,Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol,"Indian journal of dermatology, venereology and leprology",7701852,,,,,,2016/06/10 06:00,2016/06/10 06:00,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [medline]']","['ijdvl_2016_82_4_409_182387 [pii]', '10.4103/0378-6323.182387 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol. 2016 Jul-Aug;82(4):409-412. doi: 10.4103/0378-6323.182387.,10.4103/0378-6323.182387 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

F10 has strong potential for impacting cancer treatment because it displays high cytotoxicity toward proliferating malignant cells with minimal systemic toxicities thus providing an improved therapeutic window relative to traditional fluoropyrimidine drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil. F10 has a unique mechanism that involves dual targeting of thymidylate synthase and Top1. In this review, the authors provide an overview of the studies that revealed the novel aspects of F10's cytotoxic mechanism and summarize results obtained in preclinical models of acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, glioblastoma and prostate cancer that demonstrate the strong potential of F10 to improve treatment outcomes.","['Gmeiner, William H', 'Debinski, Waldemar', 'Milligan, Carol', 'Caudell, David', 'Pardee, Timothy S']","['Gmeiner WH', 'Debinski W', 'Milligan C', 'Caudell D', 'Pardee TS']","['Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.', 'Department of Neurobiology & Anatomy, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160609,England,Future Oncol,"Future oncology (London, England)",101256629,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FdUMP(10))', '134-46-3 (Fluorodeoxyuridylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Fluorodeoxyuridylate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute leukemia', '*cancer chemotherapy', '*fluoropyrimidine', '*glioblastoma', '*prostate cancer', '*thymineless death', '*topoisomerase']",2016/06/10 06:00,2017/03/04 06:00,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2217/fon-2016-0091 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Oncol. 2016 Sep;12(17):2009-20. doi: 10.2217/fon-2016-0091.

METHODS: U937 cells derived from human leukemia were sonicated with 1-MHz ultrasound at 0.4 W/cm(2) and 10 % duty factor for 60 s, a condition inducing apoptosis. The total RNA was extracted from cells at various timings after sonication and subjected to microarray and real-time PCR for miRNA expression analyses. RESULTS: Expression of several miRNAs was significantly affected by sonication. For miR-424* and miR-720, whose expressions were eminently decreased by sonication, cell lines overexpressing these miRNAs were established. Conversely, for miR-663B and miR-663, whose expressions were eminently increased by sonication, cell lines inhibiting these miRNA functions were established. When these cell lines were sonicated, a cell line inhibiting miR-663B function significantly increased sonication-induced apoptosis, suggesting this may be involved in cellular responses to sonication. Two genes that could induce apoptosis, KSR2 and CREBZF, were identified as potential target genes of miR-663B since potential target sequences on their 3' UTR mediated to decrease expression of a reporter gene. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that miRNAs may be involved in cellular responses to ultrasound through their expression changes caused by sonication.","['Ogawa, Ryohei', 'Morii, Akihiro', 'Watanabe, Akihiko']","['Ogawa R', 'Morii A', 'Watanabe A']","['Department of Radiological Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences for Research, University of Toyama, 2630 Sugitani, Toyama, 930-0194, Japan. ogawa@med.u-toyama.ac.jp.', 'Department of Urology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences for Research, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences for Research, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20120503,Japan,J Med Ultrason (2001),Journal of medical ultrasonics (2001),101128385,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Expression', 'MicroRNA', 'Microarray']",2012/10/01 00:00,2012/10/01 00:01,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2011/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2012/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10396-012-0364-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10396-012-0364-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Ultrason (2001). 2012 Oct;39(4):207-16. doi: 10.1007/s10396-012-0364-9.

Apoptosis of neutrophils induced by roscovitine has previously been demonstrated to ameliorate inflammation in several in vivo models. The present study aimed to assess whether roscovitine ameliorates EIU. EIU was induced in female C57BL/6 mice by a single intravitreal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 250 ng). The mice were divided into three groups as follows: LPS alone, LPS plus vehicle, LPS plus roscovitine (50 mg/kg). The mice were euthanized 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after LPSinduced uveitis. Accumulation of inflammatory cells in the vitreous body was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, and quantified following hematoxylin and eosin staining. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nickend labeling was performed to detect of apoptotic cells. The mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines were analyzed by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and the changes in protein levels were analyzed by western blotting. Inflammatory cells accumulated in the vitreous near the optic nerve head and the quantity peaked at 24 h after LPS injection. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the majority of the inflammatory cells were neutrophils. The number of infiltrating cells was similar in the LPS and LPS plus vehicle groups, while there were significantly less in the roscovitine group at 24 h. Apoptosis of neutrophils was observed between 12 and 48 h after roscovitine injection, while no apoptosis was observed in the other groups. The mRNA expression levels of GMCSF, CINC1 and ICAM1 peaked at 12 h after LPS injection, and decreased to normal levels at 72 h. This trend in mRNA expression was similar in the LPS and LPS plus vehicle groups; however, the expression levels decreased more quickly in the roscovitine group at 24 and 48 h. Following roscovitine administration, upregulated cleaved caspase 3 expression levels and downregulated Mcl1 expression levels were observed. In conclusion, roscovitine ameliorates EIU by effecting neutrophil apoptosis. Timely apoptosis of neutrophils may be an effective process to promote the amelioration of EIU.","['Jiang, Zhao-Xin', 'Qiu, Suo', 'Lou, Bing-Sheng', 'Yang, Yao', 'Wang, Wen-Cong', 'Lin, Xiao-Feng']","['Jiang ZX', 'Qiu S', 'Lou BS', 'Yang Y', 'Wang WC', 'Lin XF']","['State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun YatSen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510060, P.R.

This study explored dyadic longitudinal associations between both partners' family functioning and mood at diagnosis, and marital adjustment 2 years later. METHOD: Parents of children (n = 47 couples) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) completed the Family Well-Being Assessment and Profile of Mood States-Bipolar Form at diagnosis, and the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test 2 years post diagnosis. Multilevel linear models using the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) and controlling for baseline marital adjustment were conducted to evaluate within subject and dyadic longitudinal effects. RESULTS: For mothers, better marital adjustment 2 years post diagnosis was associated with perception of greater family support and less role conflict and role overload at diagnosis. For fathers, better marital adjustment 2 years post-diagnosis was associated with perception of less role conflict, greater role ambiguity, and being more tired at diagnosis, as well as their partner's perception of less role conflict at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of considering both partners' perspectives in understanding marital adjustment across treatment phases in parents of children with ALL. Early interventions for couples should be tailored to meet each partner's needs in order to foster resilience within the couple.","['Burns, W', 'Peloquin, K', 'Sultan, S', 'Moghrabi, A', 'Marcoux, S', 'Krajinovic, M', 'Sinnett, D', 'Laverdiere, C', 'Robaey, P']","['Burns W', 'Peloquin K', 'Sultan S', 'Moghrabi A', 'Marcoux S', 'Krajinovic M', 'Sinnett D', 'Laverdiere C', 'Robaey P']","['Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", 'University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160630,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anxiety/psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Empathy', 'Fathers/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Marriage/*psychology', 'Mothers/*psychology', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Personal Satisfaction']",['NOTNLM'],"['APIM', 'family functioning', 'marital adjustment', 'oncology', 'parents', 'pediatric cancer']",2016/06/10 06:00,2018/05/02 06:00,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2015/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.4189 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2017 Oct;26(10):1660-1666. doi: 10.1002/pon.4189.

However, in 2006, the NTP decided to switch to a different rat stock due largely to high background control incidences of Leydig cell tumors (LCTs) and mononuclear cell leukemia (MNCL), also known as large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia. In the current review, we aim (1) to provide a summary of NTP bioassays with treatment-associated effects involving MNCL and LCTs in addition to male F344-specific tunica vaginalis mesothelioma (TVM); (2) to describe important pathobiological differences between these F344 rat tumor responses and similar target tissue-tumor response in humans; and (3) to present the NTP reasons for switching away from the F344 rat. We show that due to the highly variable background incidence of F344 MNCL, more reliance on historical control data than is usual for most tumor responses is warranted to evaluate potential effect of any chemical treatment in this rat strain. The high spontaneous incidence of LCTs in the testes of male F344 rats has made this tumor endpoint of little practical use in identifying potential testicular carcinogenic responses. TVM responses in F344 rats have a biological plausible relationship to LCTs unlike TVM in humans. Given their high spontaneous background incidence and species-specific biology, we contend that MNCL and LCT, along with TVM responses, in F344 rat carcinogenicity studies are inappropriate tumor types for human health risk assessment and lack relevance in predicting human carcinogenicity.","['Maronpot, Robert R', 'Nyska, Abraham', 'Foreman, Jennifer E', 'Ramot, Yuval']","['Maronpot RR', 'Nyska A', 'Foreman JE', 'Ramot Y']","['a Maronpot Consulting LLC , Raleigh , NC , USA ;', 'b Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, and Consultant in Toxicologic Pathology , Timrat , Israel ;', 'c ExxonMobil Biomedical Sciences, Inc , Annadale , NJ , USA ;', 'd Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center , Jerusalem , Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160609,England,Crit Rev Toxicol,Critical reviews in toxicology,8914275,,IM,"['Animals', '*Biological Assay', '*Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Leukemia', 'Leydig Cell Tumor', 'Mesothelioma', '*Models, Animal', 'Rats', '*Rats, Inbred F344', 'Risk Assessment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer bioassay', '*LGL leukemia', '*Leydig cell tumor', '*National Toxicology Program', '*carcinogenesis bioassay', '*mononuclear cell leukemia', '*staging leukemia', '*tunica vaginalis mesothelioma']",2016/06/10 06:00,2017/08/25 06:00,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/10408444.2016.1174669 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Toxicol. 2016 Sep;46(8):641-75. doi: 10.1080/10408444.2016.1174669.

The goal of the present study was to unravel the impact of the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) on B-cell survival related both to normal B-cell homeostasis and to the detrimental effects imposed by DNA-damaging agents. By combining RA with Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligands, we show that RA prevents spontaneous, irradiation- and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis of human B cells in an RA receptor-dependent manner. RA-mediated survival involved up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) at the transcriptional level, and knock down of MCL1 by small interfering RNA partially reversed the effects of RA. To ensure that the combination of TLR9-ligands and RA would not promote the survival of malignant B cells, the combined effects of stimulation with RA and TLR9 ligands was assessed on cells from patients with B-cell malignancies. In contrast to the effects on normal B cells, the combination of TLR9 stimulation and RA neither enhanced the MCL1 levels nor inhibited the death of malignant B cells challenged by DNA-damaging agents. Taken together, the present results reveal a vital role of MCL1 in RA-mediated survival of normal B cells. Moreover, the findings suggest that RA in combination with TLR9 ligands might be useful adjuvants in the treatment of B-cell malignancies by selectively protecting normal and not malignant B cells from DNA-damage-induced cell death.","['Holm, Kristine L', 'Indrevaer, Randi L', 'Myklebust, June Helen', 'Kolstad, Arne', 'Moskaug, Jan Oivind', 'Naderi, Elin H', 'Blomhoff, Heidi K']","['Holm KL', 'Indrevaer RL', 'Myklebust JH', 'Kolstad A', 'Moskaug JO', 'Naderi EH', 'Blomhoff HK']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Science, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Science, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital HF, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Oncology, Division of Cancer Medicine, Surgery and Transplantation, Oslo University Hospital HF, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Science, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Science, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Science, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160725,England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Female', 'Homeostasis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Radiation', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin A/chemistry']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B cells', '*Toll like receptor 9', '*apoptosis', '*myeloid cell leukaemia 1', '*retinoic acid']",2016/06/10 06:00,2017/05/13 06:00,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imm.12629 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 2016 Sep;149(1):62-73. doi: 10.1111/imm.12629.

PURPOSE: In this study we wished to determine whether hypotonia-induced cell swelling of suspension cells was directly related to enhancement of ultrasound-mediated cell killing, and to verify whether similar effects could be observed on circulating and attached cells. METHODS: U937 cells under mild hypotonia were exposed to ultrasound for different times with real-time monitoring of cell size using a particle-size-distribution analyzer. To study the effect on attached cells, HeLa cells were exposed to ultrasound while under hypotonia in an in vivo-simulated set-up. RESULTS: The result showed that the enhanced cell killing (up to more than twice) was directly proportional to hypotonia-induced cell swelling. Similar membrane damage based on PI staining could be observed on HeLa cells treated with hypotonia. An in vivo-simulated circulating system also showed similar findings for hypotonia-enhanced ultrasound cell killing. CONCLUSION: These findings showed that mild hypotonia can be used to augment the effect of ultrasound in the treatment of cancers, particularly leukemia. The results showing that such enhancement is related to cell swelling could guide us toward proper timing of sonication while under hypotonic treatment.","['Feril, Loreto B Jr', 'Tachibana, Katsuro', 'Kondo, Takashi', 'Ogawa, Ryohei', 'Zhao, Qing-Li', 'Yamaguchi, Kazuki', 'Ogawa, Koichi', 'Endo, Hitomi', 'Irie, Yutaka', 'Harada, Yoshimi']","['Feril LB Jr', 'Tachibana K', 'Kondo T', 'Ogawa R', 'Zhao QL', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Ogawa K', 'Endo H', 'Irie Y', 'Harada Y']","['Department of Anatomy, Fukuoka University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan. ferilism@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Anatomy, Fukuoka University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.', 'Department of Radiological Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Radiological Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Radiological Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, 930-0194, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Fukuoka University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Fukuoka University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Fukuoka University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Fukuoka University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Fukuoka University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091009,Japan,J Med Ultrason (2001),Journal of medical ultrasonics (2001),101128385,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Hypotonia', 'Sonomechanical effect', 'Ultrasound']",2010/01/01 00:00,2010/01/01 00:01,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2008/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10396-009-0241-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s10396-009-0241-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Ultrason (2001). 2010 Jan;37(1):3-8. doi: 10.1007/s10396-009-0241-3.

Leukemia accounts for one-third of all childhood cancers, 78% of which is acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The development of cancer has been associated with malignant cells that express low levels of immunogenic molecules, which facilitates their escape from the antineoplastic immune response. It is thought that it may be possible to rescue the antineoplastic immune response through the activation of recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which activate the innate immune system. TLRs are type I membrane glycoproteins expressed mainly in immune system cells such as monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, T, B and natural killer cells. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of TLR1, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with ALL and prior to any treatment. PBMCs were obtained from 50 pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL and from 20 children attending the ophthalmology and orthopedics services. The mean fluorescence intensity was obtained by analysis of immunofluorescence. We found lower expression levels of TLR1, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 in PBMCs from patients with ALL compared with those from control patients. We also observed that the PBMCs from patients with Pre-B and B ALL had lower TLR4 expression than controls and patients with Pro-B, Pre-B, B and T ALL had lower TLR7 expression than controls. The present study is the first to demonstrate reduced expression of TLRs in PBMCs from pediatric patients with ALL. This finding is of great relevance and may partly explain the reduction in the antineoplastic immune response in patients with ALL.","['Sanchez-Cuaxospa, Maria', 'Contreras-Ramos, Alejandra', 'Perez-Figueroa, Erandi', 'Medina-Sanson, Aurora', 'Jimenez-Hernandez, Elva', 'Torres-Nava, Jose R', 'Rojas-Castillo, Emilio', 'Maldonado-Bernal, Carmen']","['Sanchez-Cuaxospa M', 'Contreras-Ramos A', 'Perez-Figueroa E', 'Medina-Sanson A', 'Jimenez-Hernandez E', 'Torres-Nava JR', 'Rojas-Castillo E', 'Maldonado-Bernal C']","[""Immunology and Proteomic Research Laboratory, Children's Hospital of Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico."", ""Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Children's Hospital of Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico."", ""Immunology and Proteomic Research Laboratory, Children's Hospital of Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico."", ""Oncology Service, Children's Hospital Moctezuma, Mexico City, Mexico."", ""Oncology Service, Children's Hospital Moctezuma, Mexico City, Mexico."", 'Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', ""Immunology and Proteomic Research Laboratory, Children's Hospital of Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160607,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (TLR3 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 3)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dendritic Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Killer Cells, Natural/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/pathology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/*blood', 'Toll-Like Receptor 3/*blood', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*blood', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/*blood', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/*blood']",,,2016/06/10 06:00,2017/04/05 06:00,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2016.3569 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2016 Aug;49(2):675-81. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2016.3569.

Some of the more frequently used medications in cancer include taxanes for ovarian, lung, breast, and prostate cancers. Monoclonal antibodies are used in the treatment of neoplastic, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases, and their clinical applications are becoming broader. Monoclonal antibody targets include CD20, HER-2, EGFR, IL-6 receptor, TNF-alpha, CD30, VEGF-A, IgE, and more, and examples of immune-mediated and inflammatory diseases that respond to monoclonal antibodies include rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and asthma. Neoplastic diseases include non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and colorectal, breast, gastric, and lung cancer. The clinical presentation of drug hypersensitivity reactions ranges from mild cutaneous reactions to life-threatening symptoms including anaphylaxis. Rapid drug desensitization (RDD) has become a groundbreaking approach to the management of immediate drug hypersensitivity reactions IgE and non-IgE mediated. It is the only effective procedure that enables sensitized patients to receive the full treatment dose safely, thus representing an important advance in the patients' treatment and prognosis. The aim of this review is to provide an update on hypersensitivity reactions to commonly used monoclonal and taxanes, their clinical presentations, diagnosis, and the use of RDD for their management.","['Bonamichi-Santos, Rafael', 'Castells, Mariana']","['Bonamichi-Santos R', 'Castells M']","[""Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. rafaelbonamichi@hotmail.com."", 'Division of Clinical Immunology and Allergy Division, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. rafaelbonamichi@hotmail.com.', ""Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology,9504368,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Taxoids)']",IM,"['Anaphylaxis/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Taxoids/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adverse drug reaction', 'Drug hypersensitivity reaction', 'Monoclonal antibodies', 'Rapid drug desensitization', 'Taxanes']",2016/06/10 06:00,2018/10/12 06:00,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12016-016-8556-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12016-016-8556-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Rev Allergy Immunol. 2018 Jun;54(3):375-385. doi: 10.1007/s12016-016-8556-5.,10.1007/s12016-016-8556-5 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative studies relating to atopy, allergy, or asthma and cancer were identified and tabulated. Despite many exposure-related limitations, patterns in the studies were observed. Asthma, specifically, has been observed to be a risk factor for lung cancer. A protective effect of atopic diseases against pancreatic cancer has been shown consistently in case-control studies but not in cohort studies. Allergy of any type appears to be protective against glioma and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Most studies on atopic diseases and non-Hodgkin lymphoma or colorectal cancer reported an inverse association. The other sites identified had varying and non-significant outcomes.

The disease is rare and can be fatal. CASE OUTLINE: We report a 30-year-old female who was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, with maturation and cytogenetic finding of t(8;21)(q22;q22),del(9)(q22) in January 2004. She was treated with chemotherapy and achieved complete remission that lasts to date. She became pregnant and delivered a healthy newborn with caesarean section in 2009. Seven months later, she again became pregnant and delivered the second child with caesarean section in January 2011. Seven days after delivery she developed symptoms and signs of heart failure. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, low voltage and negative T-waves in inferior and lateral leads. Echocardiography revealed global left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 15%, with mobile thrombotic mass of 12 mm attached to the left ventricle wall. She was treated with both unfractionated and low-molecular heparin, diuretics, cardiotonics, and beta-blockers. Within six following weeks left ventricle systolic function improved up to 25-30%. The full clinical recovery was achieved in September 2013, resulting in absence of heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction of 54%. CONCLUSION: Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare condition. The cause of cardiomyopathy is unknown, but it is believed that it could be triggered by various conditions and risk factors. Although the patient was treated with cardiotoxic drugs (doxorubicin and mitoxantrone) in permitted doses, they could have been contributory factors of myocardial damage.

One hypothesis of LHC risks is exposure to occupational carcinogens. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of occupational exposure and LHC risks in Rayong province, Thailand. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This matched hospital-based case-control study was conducted in a Rayong provincial hospital from September 2009 to January 2013. One LHC case was matched with four controls in gender and age, +/-5 years. Demographic data, residential factors, behavioral factors, and occupational exposure-including chemical exposure-were obtained by interviews and collected by occupational health care officers. The risk factor was analyzed by conditional logistic regression and reported in odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: This study found 105 LHC cases which met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study, yielding a 66% cover rate of cases reported in the database. The histology of LHC were 51 leukemia cases (47.7%), 43 lymphoma cases (42.0%), and 11 multiple myeloma cases (10.3%). The results revealed that occupational exposure to pesticide and smoke were statistically significantly associated with LHC with adjusted ORs 2.26 (95% CI 1.30-3.91) and 1.99 (95% CI = 1.13-3.51), respectively. When stratified to histological subtype of LHC by WHO 2000, leukemia was statistically significantly associated with occupational exposure to smoke, adjusted ORs 2.43 (95% CI 1.11-5.36), with occupational pesticide exposure a significant risk of lymphoma, adjusted ORs 4.69 (95% CI 2.01-10.96). However, neither fumes, wood dust, working outdoors, cleaners, contact with animals, petroleum products and chlorine; nor occupational exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as benzene or organic solvents, were statistically significant risk factors of LHC. In addition, there were no significant risks in the demographic data, residential factors, and behavioral factors. CONCLUSION: Occupational exposure to pesticides and smoke were important occupational risks in developing LHC in Rayong province. However, the ability or power to detect this problem due to the small sample size and recall bias from the study design could not be excluded.","['Punjindasup, Apinya', 'Sangrajrang, Suleeporn', 'Ekpanyaskul, Chatchai']","['Punjindasup A', 'Sangrajrang S', 'Ekpanyaskul C']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,"['0 (Pesticides)', '0 (Smoke)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoke/*adverse effects', 'Thailand/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/06/10 06:00,2016/06/29 06:00,['2016/06/10 06:00'],"['2016/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2015 Nov;98 Suppl 10:S13-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our next challenge is to understand how this genetic diversity defines the pathophysiology of AML and informs clinical practice. METHODS: We enrolled a total of 1540 patients in three prospective trials of intensive therapy. Combining driver mutations in 111 cancer genes with cytogenetic and clinical data, we defined AML genomic subgroups and their relevance to clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 5234 driver mutations across 76 genes or genomic regions, with 2 or more drivers identified in 86% of the patients. Patterns of co-mutation compartmentalized the cohort into 11 classes, each with distinct diagnostic features and clinical outcomes. In addition to currently defined AML subgroups, three heterogeneous genomic categories emerged: AML with mutations in genes encoding chromatin, RNA-splicing regulators, or both (in 18% of patients); AML with TP53 mutations, chromosomal aneuploidies, or both (in 13%); and, provisionally, AML with IDH2(R172) mutations (in 1%). Patients with chromatin-spliceosome and TP53-aneuploidy AML had poor outcomes, with the various class-defining mutations contributing independently and additively to the outcome. In addition to class-defining lesions, other co-occurring driver mutations also had a substantial effect on overall survival. The prognostic effects of individual mutations were often significantly altered by the presence or absence of other driver mutations. Such gene-gene interactions were especially pronounced for NPM1-mutated AML, in which patterns of co-mutation identified groups with a favorable or adverse prognosis. These predictions require validation in prospective clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: The driver landscape in AML reveals distinct molecular subgroups that reflect discrete paths in the evolution of AML, informing disease classification and prognostic stratification.

Our aim was to verify if HBV encoding proteins enhance the transcription of hPIAS1 and which cis-elements and transcription factors were involved in the mechanism. In order to do, so a series of molecular biological methods, along with functional and histological studies, were performed. We found that the HBV surface protein (HBs) enhanced hPIAS1 transcription through the activities of TAL1, E47, myogenin (MYOG), and NFI, dependent on the activation of p38MAPK and ERK signaling pathways in vitro, which might contribute to the ineffectiveness of treatment in CHB patients. Furthermore, liver samples from patients with high HBsAg levels and HBV DNA displayed increased hPIAS1 expression and high levels of TAL1, E47, MYOG, and NFI, compared to those patients with low HBsAg levels and HBV DNA, and healthy controls. These findings suggest that the HBs protein-induced hPIAS1 transcription requires TAL1, E47, MYOG, NFI, and MAPK signal pathways.

It causes acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by dysregulating the expression of genes critical for myeloid cell development and differentiation and recently has been reported to bind multiple subunits of the mammalian cytosolic chaperonin TRiC (or CCT), primarily through its DNA binding domain (AML1-175). Through these interactions, TRiC plays an important role in the synthesis, folding, and activity of AML1-ETO. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we demonstrate here that a folding intermediate of AML1-ETO's DNA-binding domain (AML1-175) forms a stable complex with apo-TRiC.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of peripheral lymphocyte subsets, especially CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cell recovery, in predicting transplant outcomes, including the overall survival (OS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) rates after unmanipulated haploidentical blood and marrow transplantation (HBMT). METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 214 HBMT recipients with hematological malignancies. The peripheral lymphocyte subsets (CD3+ T cells, CD3+CD4+ helper T cells, CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, and CD19+ B cells) were analyzed by flow cytometry at days 30, 60, 90, 180, 270 and 360 after HBMT. RESULTS: The CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cell recovery at day 90 (CD3+CD8+-90) was correlated with bacterial infection (P = 0.001), NRM (P = 0.001), leukemia-free survival (LFS, P = 0.005), and OS (P = 0.001) at a cutoff value of 375 cells/muL CD3+CD8+ T cells. The incidence of bacterial infection in patients with the CD3+CD8+-90 at >/=375 cells/muL was significantly lower than that of cases with the CD3+CD8+-90 at <375 cells/muL after HBMT (14.6% versus 41.6%, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed the rapid recovery of CD3+CD8+ T cells at day 90 after HBMT was strongly associated with a lower incidence of NRM (HR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.15-0.60; P = 0.000) and superior LFS (HR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.32-0.82; P = 0.005) and OS (HR = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.23-0.63; P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the rapid recovery of CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells at day 90 following HBMT could predict superior transplant outcomes.","['Tian, Deng-Mei', 'Wang, Yu', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun', 'Chang, Ying-Jun']","['Tian DM', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang XH', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ', 'Chang YJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11 South Street of Xizhimen, Xicheng District, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, 309th Hospital, Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11 South Street of Xizhimen, Xicheng District, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11 South Street of Xizhimen, Xicheng District, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11 South Street of Xizhimen, Xicheng District, Beijing, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11 South Street of Xizhimen, Xicheng District, Beijing, China."", 'Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Collabrative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China.', ""Peking University People's Hospital & Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, No. 11 South Street of Xizhimen, Xicheng District, Beijing, China."", 'Collabrative Innovation Center of Hematology, Peking University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20160608,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/blood/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', '*Recovery of Function', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/metabolism']",,,2016/06/09 06:00,2017/07/15 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0156777 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-06168 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jun 8;11(6):e0156777. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0156777. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0156777 [doi],['R21 AA020104/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4898737,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eliminating LSCs, the root of cancer origin and recurrence, is considered to be a hopeful approach to improve survival or even to cure cancer patients. In order to achieve this, the characterization of LSCs is a prerequisite in order to develop LSC-based therapies to eliminate them. Here we review if vitamin D analogues may allow an avenue to target the LSCs.","['Garcia-Ramirez, Idoia', 'Martin-Lorenzo, Alberto', 'Gonzalez-Herrero, Ines', 'Rodriguez-Hernandez, Guillermo', 'Vicente-Duenas, Carolina', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Isidro']","['Garcia-Ramirez I', 'Martin-Lorenzo A', 'Gonzalez-Herrero I', 'Rodriguez-Hernandez G', 'Vicente-Duenas C', 'Sanchez-Garcia I']","['Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biolog&#237;a Molecular y Celular del C&#225;ncer, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, Salamanca 37007, Spain. idoia.g@usal.es.', 'Cancer Research Area, Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca 37007, Spain. idoia.g@usal.es.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biolog&#237;a Molecular y Celular del C&#225;ncer, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, Salamanca 37007, Spain. trioney@usal.es.', 'Cancer Research Area, Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca 37007, Spain. trioney@usal.es.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biolog&#237;a Molecular y Celular del C&#225;ncer, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, Salamanca 37007, Spain. ighe@usal.es.', 'Cancer Research Area, Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca 37007, Spain. ighe@usal.es.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biolog&#237;a Molecular y Celular del C&#225;ncer, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, Salamanca 37007, Spain. guillermorh@usal.es.', 'Cancer Research Area, Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca 37007, Spain. guillermorh@usal.es.', 'Cancer Research Area, Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca 37007, Spain. cvd@usal.es.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biolog&#237;a Molecular y Celular del C&#225;ncer, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Campus M. de Unamuno s/n, Salamanca 37007, Spain. isg@usal.es.', 'Cancer Research Area, Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca 37007, Spain. isg@usal.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160606,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/metabolism', 'Vitamin D/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'cancer stem cells', 'leukemia therapy', 'mouse models', 'stem cells', 'vitamin D']",2016/06/09 06:00,2017/04/07 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms17060889 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms17060889 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2016 Jun 6;17(6). pii: ijms17060889. doi: 10.3390/ijms17060889.,10.3390/ijms17060889 [doi] E889 [pii],,PMC4926423,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In such circumstances, instead of giving full-blown chemotherapy, palliative metronomic chemotherapy (MCT) could be a treatment option. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective pilot study of old AML patients (age >60 years) not amenable to curative treatment. Thirty-two patients were enrolled into the study and were treated with daily oral 6-mercaptopurine 75 mg/m(2). The following inclusion criteria were used: age >60 years, nonpromyelocytic AML, the absence of uncontrolled comorbidities, and patient not amenable to curative treatment. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used to calculate the hazards ratio of significant factors. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 69 years (range: 61-86 years) with male: female ratio of 2.5:1. About 59.4% of patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 while rest had the status of 3. The median OS was 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.4-7.6). Males had median OS of 7 months (95% CI: 5.4-8.6) versus females with OS of 3 months (95% CI: 1.5-4.4; P = 0.008). There was no survival difference on the basis of baseline hemoglobin or French-American-British class. There were no Grade 4 toxicities and no episode of febrile neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: MCT with oral 6-mercaptopurine is an attractive treatment option in elderly AML patients who are not amenable to curative therapy with minimal toxicities.","['Kapoor, Akhil', 'Beniwal, Surender Kumar', 'Kalwar, Ashok', 'Singhal, Mukesh Kumar', 'Nirban, Raj Kumar', 'Kumar, Harvindra Singh']","['Kapoor A', 'Beniwal SK', 'Kalwar A', 'Singhal MK', 'Nirban RK', 'Kumar HS']","['Department of Oncology, Acharya Tulsi Regional Cancer Treatment and Research Institute, Sardar Patel Medical College, Bikaner, Rajasthan, India.', 'Department of Oncology, Acharya Tulsi Regional Cancer Treatment and Research Institute, Sardar Patel Medical College, Bikaner, Rajasthan, India.', 'Department of Oncology, Acharya Tulsi Regional Cancer Treatment and Research Institute, Sardar Patel Medical College, Bikaner, Rajasthan, India.', 'Department of Oncology, Acharya Tulsi Regional Cancer Treatment and Research Institute, Sardar Patel Medical College, Bikaner, Rajasthan, India.', 'Department of Oncology, Acharya Tulsi Regional Cancer Treatment and Research Institute, Sardar Patel Medical College, Bikaner, Rajasthan, India.', 'Department of Oncology, Acharya Tulsi Regional Cancer Treatment and Research Institute, Sardar Patel Medical College, Bikaner, Rajasthan, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,South Asian J Cancer,South Asian journal of cancer,101618774,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['6-mercaptopurine', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'elderly', 'metronomic chemotherapy']",2016/06/09 06:00,2016/06/09 06:01,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/2278-330X.181644 [doi]', 'SAJC-5-70 [pii]']",ppublish,South Asian J Cancer. 2016 Apr-Jun;5(2):70-2. doi: 10.4103/2278-330X.181644.,10.4103/2278-330X.181644 [doi],,PMC4873702,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is characterized at the cytogenetic level by Philadelphia (ph) chromosome and at the molecular level by the BCR/ABL gene rearrangement. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells that can differentiate into several mesenchymal tissues. AIM: To observe the biological characteristics of MSCS from CML patients and to determine whether MSCs harbor the abnormal BCR/ABL translocation similar to CML bone marrow cells. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Characterized MSCs were isolated from 12 newly diagnosed Philadelphia positive untreated CML patients. RESULTS: MSCs can be readily isolated from CML marrow and exhibit major expansion. Flow cytometry analysis revealed the typical MSC phenotype. Moreover; MSCs do not harbor the BCR/ABL translocation confirmed by karyotype and real time PCR. CONCLUSION: MSCs from CML patients express the typical MSC phenotype; and do not express the BCR/ABL gene. Since; MSCs are able to support engraftment of hematopoietic stem cells in stem cell transplantation(SCT) as well as suppress alloreactive T cells causing graft versus -host disease, this current study provides evidence that in a SCT setting of CML patients, autologous MSCs could be a source of stem cell support in future cell therapy applications.","['Gaafar, Taghrid Mohamed', 'Raafat, Inas Ismail', 'Aly, Azza Ahmed', 'Mohamed, Nagwa Abd El-Ghaffar', 'Farid, Reem Jan', 'Saad, Neveen Ezzat', 'El-Hawary, Rabab', 'Mostafaa, Naglaa', 'Ahmed, Mirhan Mohamed']","['Gaafar TM', 'Raafat II', 'Aly AA', 'Mohamed NA', 'Farid RJ', 'Saad NE', 'El-Hawary R', 'Mostafaa N', 'Ahmed MM']","['Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, National Research Center, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, National Research Center, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, National Research Center, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, National Research Center, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20150408,North Macedonia,Open Access Maced J Med Sci,Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences,101662294,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'mesenchymal stem cell']",2016/06/09 06:00,2016/06/09 06:01,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2014/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3889/oamjms.2015.040 [doi]', 'OAMJMS-3-231 [pii]']",ppublish,Open Access Maced J Med Sci. 2015 Jun 15;3(2):231-6. doi: 10.3889/oamjms.2015.040.

In young children it is also largely curable, with more than 90% of afflicted children achieving long-term remission. PRAME (Preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma) gene belongs to Group 3 class I HLA-restricted widely expressed antigens in which genes encoding widely expressed tumor antigens have been detected in many normal tissues as well as in histologically different types of tumors with no preferential expression on a certain type of cancer. It has been found to be expressed in a variety of cancer cells as leukemia & lymphoma. PRAME monitoring can be useful for detection of minimal residual disease and subsequent relapses particularly those leukemias in which specific tumor markers are unavailable. Wilms' tumor1 (WT1) gene was identified as a gene that plays an important role in normal kidney development and inactivation of its function was shown to result in the development of Wilms' tumors in paediatric patients. Disruption of WT1 function has been implicated in the formation of many different tumor types. AIM: to study how PRAME & WT 1 genes expression patterns influence cancer susceptibility & prognosis. PATIENTS & METHODS: 50 patients with denovo childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as 50 age and sex matched apparently healthy volunteers were genotyped for PRAME and WT1 genes expression by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: PRAME gene was expressed in 34 of the patients (68%) and WT1 gene was expressed in 26 of the patients (52%). Expression of both genes was significantly higher compared to controls (P < 0.0001). Analysis of relapse free survival among our patients revealed that patients expressing PRAME gene or WT1 gene had better relapse free survival (p value=0.02 and 0.01 respectively). Relapse free survival increased significantly among patients coexpressing PRAME and WT 1(p value =0.001). CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the expression of PRAME and WT1 genes are indicators of favorable prognosis and can be useful tools for monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute leukemia especially in patients without known genetic markers. Differential expression between acute leukemia patients and healthy volunteers suggests that the immunogenic antigens (PRAME and WT1) are potential candidates for immunotherapy in childhood acute leukemia.","['Khateeb, Engy El', 'Morgan, Dalia']","['Khateeb EE', 'Morgan D']","['Cairo University Kasr El Aini Faculty of Medicine, Clinical Pathology, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Medicine Bany Swef university, Pediatrics Department, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20141208,North Macedonia,Open Access Maced J Med Sci,Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences,101662294,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'PRAME', 'RT-PCR', 'WT1', 'cancer susceptibility', 'prognosis']",2015/03/15 00:00,2015/03/15 00:01,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2014/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2014/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/15 00:01 [medline]']","['10.3889/oamjms.2015.001 [doi]', 'OAMJMS-3-57 [pii]']",ppublish,Open Access Maced J Med Sci. 2015 Mar 15;3(1):57-62. doi: 10.3889/oamjms.2015.001.

METHODS: Balb/c mice were injected intraperitoneally with L-arginine to induce SAP. Recombinant mouse IL-22 was then administered subcutaneously to mice. Serum amylase levels and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the lung tissue were measured after the L-arginine administration. Histopathology of the pancreas and lung was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Expression of B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-xL and IL-22RA1 mRNAs in the lung tissue was detected by real-time PCR. Expression and phosphorylation of STAT3 were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: Serum amylase levels and MPO activity in the lung tissue in the SAP group were significantly higher than those in the normal control group (P < 0.05). In addition, the animals in the SAP group showed significant pancreatic and lung injuries. The expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL mRNAs in the SAP group was decreased markedly, while the IL-22RA1 mRNA expression was increased significantly relative to the normal control group (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with PBS did not significantly affect the serum amylase levels, MPO activity or expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or IL-22RA1 mRNA (P > 0.05). Moreover, no significant differences in the degrees of pancreatic and lung injuries were observed between the PBS and SAP groups. However, the serum amylase levels and lung tissue MPO activity in the rIL-22 group were significantly lower than those in the SAP group (P < 0.05), and the injuries in the pancreas and lung were also improved. Compared with the PBS group, rIL-22 stimulated the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and IL-22RA1 mRNAs in the lung (P < 0.05). In addition, the ratio of p-STAT3 to STAT3 protein in the rIL-22 group was significantly higher than that in the PBS group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Exogenous recombinant IL-22 protects mice against L-arginine-induced SAP-associated lung injury by enhancing the expression of anti-apoptosis genes through the STAT3 signaling pathway.","['Qiao, Ying-Ying', 'Liu, Xiao-Qin', 'Xu, Chang-Qin', 'Zhang, Zheng', 'Xu, Hong-Wei']","['Qiao YY', 'Liu XQ', 'Xu CQ', 'Zhang Z', 'Xu HW']","['Ying-Ying Qiao, Xiao-Qin Liu, Chang-Qin Xu, Zheng Zhang, Hong-Wei Xu, Department of Gastroenterology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250021, Shandong Province, China.', 'Ying-Ying Qiao, Xiao-Qin Liu, Chang-Qin Xu, Zheng Zhang, Hong-Wei Xu, Department of Gastroenterology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250021, Shandong Province, China.', 'Ying-Ying Qiao, Xiao-Qin Liu, Chang-Qin Xu, Zheng Zhang, Hong-Wei Xu, Department of Gastroenterology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250021, Shandong Province, China.', 'Ying-Ying Qiao, Xiao-Qin Liu, Chang-Qin Xu, Zheng Zhang, Hong-Wei Xu, Department of Gastroenterology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250021, Shandong Province, China.', 'Ying-Ying Qiao, Xiao-Qin Liu, Chang-Qin Xu, Zheng Zhang, Hong-Wei Xu, Department of Gastroenterology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250021, Shandong Province, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (interleukin-22 receptor)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Amylases)', 'XEO71E2E45 (interleukin-22)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Acute Lung Injury/blood/etiology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Amylases/blood', 'Animals', 'Arginine', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Blotting, Western', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Lung/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Pancreas/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Pancreatitis/blood/chemically induced/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Peroxidase/blood', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Interleukin/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute severe pancreatitis', 'Anti-apoptosis gene', 'Interleukin-22', 'Lung injury', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3']",2016/06/09 06:00,2017/04/11 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3748/wjg.v22.i21.5023 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2016 Jun 7;22(21):5023-32. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v22.i21.5023.,10.3748/wjg.v22.i21.5023 [doi],,PMC4886377,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While a popular approach for analysis of such datasets is principal component analysis (PCA), this method is not designed to optimally discriminate different phenotypes. Moreover, PCA and other low-dimensional representation methods yield linear or non-linear combinations of all measured miRs. Global human miR expression was measured in AML, B-ALL, and TALL cell lines and patient RNA samples. By systematically applying support vector machines to all measured miRs taken in dyad and triad groups, we built miR networks using cell line data and validated our findings with primary patient samples. All the coordinately transcribed members of the miR-23a cluster (which includes also miR-24 and miR-27a), known to function as tumor suppressors of acute leukemias, appeared in the AML, B-ALL and T-ALL centric networks. Subsequent qRT-PCR analysis showed that the most connected miR in the B-ALL-centric network, miR-708, is highly and specifically expressed in B-ALLs, suggesting that miR-708 might serve as a biomarker for B-ALL. This approach is systematic, quantitative, scalable, and unbiased. Rather than a single signature, our approach yields a network of signatures reflecting the redundant nature of biological signaling pathways. The network representation allows for visual analysis of all signatures by an expert and for future integration of additional information. Furthermore, each signature involves only small sets of miRs, such as dyads and triads, which are well suited for in depth validation through laboratory experiments. In particular, loss-and gain-of-function assays designed to drive changes in leukemia cell survival, proliferation and differentiation will benefit from the identification of multi-miR signatures that characterize leukemia subtypes and their normal counterpart cells of origin.","['Candia, Julian', 'Cherukuri, Srujana', 'Guo, Yin', 'Doshi, Kshama A', 'Banavar, Jayanth R', 'Civin, Curt I', 'Losert, Wolfgang']","['Candia J', 'Cherukuri S', 'Guo Y', 'Doshi KA', 'Banavar JR', 'Civin CI', 'Losert W']","['Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity and Inflammation, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA; Department of Physics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA; Center for Stem Cell Biology & Regenerative Medicine, Departments of Pediatrics and Physiology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore MD 21201, USA.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology & Regenerative Medicine, Departments of Pediatrics and Physiology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore MD 21201, USA; Noble Life Sciences, 22 Firstfield Rd, Gaithersburg, MD 20878, USA.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology & Regenerative Medicine, Departments of Pediatrics and Physiology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore MD 21201, USA.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology & Regenerative Medicine, Departments of Pediatrics and Physiology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore MD 21201, USA.', 'Department of Physics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology & Regenerative Medicine, Departments of Pediatrics and Physiology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore MD 21201, USA.', 'Department of Physics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151221,England,Converg Sci Phys Oncol,Convergent science physical oncology,101674478,,,,,,2016/06/09 06:00,2016/06/09 06:01,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1088/2057-1739/1/2/025002 [doi]'],ppublish,Converg Sci Phys Oncol. 2015 Dec;1(2). doi: 10.1088/2057-1739/1/2/025002.

The aims of this study were to characterize the expression profile of pre-B cell leukemia homeobox (PBX) transcription factors in prostate cancer with an emphasis on investigating whether PBX3 harbours any prognostic value. The expression profile of PBX3 and PBX1 in prostate tissue was determined by immunohistochemical and immunoblot analysis. Furthermore, the expression of PBX3 transcript variants was analyzed by RT-PCR, NanoString Technologies(R), and by analyzing RNA sequence data. The potential of PBX3 to predict prognosis, either at mRNA or protein level, was studied in four independent cohorts. PBX3 was mainly expressed in the nucleus of normal prostate basal cells, while it showed cytosolic expression in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer cells. We detected four PBX3 transcript variants in prostate tissue. Competing risk regression analysis revealed that high PBX3 expression was associated with slower progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (sub-hazard ratio (SHR) 0.18, 95% CI: 0.081-0.42, p values < 0.001). PBX3 expression had a high predictive accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.82) when combined with Gleason score and age.

We investigated 66 patients, including 40 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 12 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 14 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes and HLA ligands were typed by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide probes. We analyzed the effect of the number of missing KIR ligands (Bw4, C1 and C2) on clinical outcomes. A beneficial effect of missing KIR ligand was not observed in both univariate and multivariate analysis. When we analyzed the effect of specific missing KIR ligand on clinical outcomes, there was a trend that patients with missing A11 ligand had lower relapse rate (P = 0.076). Therefore, we also conducted the analysis by including the group with missing KIR ligands of Bw4, C1, C2 and A11. Patients with two or more than two missing KIR ligands had a trend for better clinical outcome including reduced relapse (P = 055) and statistically significant in terms of reduced acute graft-vs-host disease (aGVHD) rate (P = 0.013).

The current study sought to determine the percentage of BLV infection and persistent lymphocytosis (PL) in cattle in central Iraq. Hematological, serological, and molecular observations in cross breeds and local breeds of Iraqi cattle naturally infected with BLV were conducted in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 400 cattle (340 cross breed and 60 local breed) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). On the basis of the absolute number of lymphocytes, five of the 31 positive PCR cases had PL. Among these leukemic cattle, one case exhibited overt neutrophilia. Serum samples were used to detect BLV antibodies, which were observed in 28 (7%) samples. PCR detected BLV provirus in 31 samples (7.75%). All 28 of the seropositive samples and the 3 seronegative samples were positive using PCR. Associations were observed between bovine leukosis and cattle breed, age and sex. Age-specific analysis showed that the BLV percentage increased with age in both breeds. Female cattle (29 animals; 7.34%) exhibited significantly higher infectivity than male cattle (two animals; 4.34%). In conclusion, comprehensive screening for all affected animals is needed in Iraq; programs that segregate cattle can be an effective and important method to control and/or eliminate the BLV.","['Khudhair, Yahia Ismail', 'Hasso, Saleem Amin', 'Yaseen, Nahi Y', 'Al-Shammari, Ahmed Majeed']","['Khudhair YI', 'Hasso SA', 'Yaseen NY', 'Al-Shammari AM']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Al-University of Qadisiyah, Al Diwaniyah 58002, Iraq.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Baghdad, Baghdad 10001, Iraq.', 'Experimental Therapy Department, Iraqi Center for Cancer and Medical Genetic Research, Mustansiriyah University, Baghdad 10001, Iraq.', 'Experimental Therapy Department, Iraqi Center for Cancer and Medical Genetic Research, Mustansiriyah University, Baghdad 10001, Iraq.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160608,United States,Emerg Microbes Infect,Emerging microbes & infections,101594885,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*epidemiology/virology', 'Female', 'Iraq/epidemiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Lymphocytosis/*veterinary/virology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses', 'Sex Factors']",,,2016/06/09 06:00,2017/01/20 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2015/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['emi201660 [pii]', '10.1038/emi.2016.60 [doi]']",epublish,Emerg Microbes Infect. 2016 Jun 8;5:e56. doi: 10.1038/emi.2016.60.,10.1038/emi.2016.60 [doi],,PMC4932651,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are highly effective in the treatment of CML, numerous clinical trials have shown that many patients become refractory or drug resistance, especially those in the blastic crisis of CML. The molecular mechanisms underlying CML, however, remain poorly understood. In the present study, we used a coculture model to address possible mechanisms underlying the involvement of bone marrow microenvironment in the drug resistance of CML. Our data show that interleukin-7(IL-7) levels in the bone marrow of CML patients in blastic crisis are significantly higher than those of both healthy persons and CML patients in chronic and accelerated phases. The increased IL-7 was secreted by mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the bone marrow, which may protect leukemic cells from apoptosis induced by imatinib through JAK1/STAT5 signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that therapeutic strategies IL-7 signaling pathway may represent a promising approach for improving CML therapy, especially for patients in blastic crisis.","['Zhang, Xiaoyan', 'Tu, Huaijun', 'Yang, Yazhi', 'Wan, Qian', 'Fang, Lijun', 'Wu, Qiong', 'Li, Jian']","['Zhang X', 'Tu H', 'Yang Y', 'Wan Q', 'Fang L', 'Wu Q', 'Li J']","['The Key Laboratory of Hematology of Jiangxi Province, The Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 1 Minde Road, Nanchang, 330006, Jiangxi, P.R.

The Project group Internistic Oncology (PIO) embarked on an analysis of the 'real-world' safety and efficacy of bendamustine with and without rituximab in unselected outpatients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter, open-label, prospectively stratified, retrospective study was conducted to determine routine feasibility, toxicity, and response rates obtained by bendamustine with and without rituximab in a random population of mostly elderly patients with CLL. Records were obtained from 775 patients with CLL from 60 private medical oncology practices. Informed consent was obtained prior to study participation. The median observation time was 28 months. Patients were stratified according to age, and treatment. Response criteria and statistics followed international guidelines adopted by the ""German Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Study Group"". RESULTS: Overall, 57.5% of patients were over 70 (range=36-95) years old. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and age influenced the total dose given, decreasing by 20% between ECOG 0 and 3, and by 15% above 80 years old. Response rates did not differ between the ages of 60 to 80 years, with an overall remission rate for bendamustine of 83%, and for the combination therapy of 89%, decreasing above the age of 80 years. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 25% of 775 patients, and grade 3 or 4 non-hematological adverse events in 9.55% (n=74), not interfering with the treatment. CONCLUSION: Bendamustine with and without rituximab was associated with high activity and tolerability, irrespective of age and risk factors. The median overall survival was 64 months with a 3-year survival rate of 72%; progression-free survival was 30.6 months, and the 3 year PFS was 43%. The good tolerability and feasibility of bendamustine with and without rituximab, in particular for the elderly population with CLL argues for it being a safe outpatient treatment.","['Kleeberg, Ulrich Richard', 'Linde, Hartmut', 'Gunther, Georg', 'Tessen, Hans-Werner', 'Kersting, Markus']","['Kleeberg UR', 'Linde H', 'Gunther G', 'Tessen HW', 'Kersting M']","['Hematology-Oncology Practice Altona (HOPA), Hamburg, Germany urkleeberg@hopa-hamburg.de.', 'MVZ, Medical Care Center for Blood and Cancer, Hamburg, Germany.', 'MVZ, Medical Care Center for Blood and Cancer, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Oncological Cooperation Harz, Goslar, Germany.', 'RGB Oncology Management GmbH, Sarstedt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Review']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'bendamustine', 'outpatient treatment', 'rituximab', 'side-effects']",2016/06/09 06:00,2017/01/28 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['36/6/2827 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2016 Jun;36(6):2827-38.,,,,,,,"['Copyright(c) 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a case series of 18 patients clinically and histopathologically diagnosed with AIFRS with a mean follow-up of 9.11 +/- 2.51 months (range 6-17). Demographic data, apparent symptoms and signs, underlying disorders, and outcomes are discussed. The mean age was 39.56 +/- 20.66 years (range 2-75). The most common underlying diseases were diabetes mellitus (50 %) and leukemia (44.44 %). Mucosal biopsy confirmed fungal invasion of the nasal mucosa in all cases. The main fungi were Rhizopus oryzae (55.56 %), Absidia mucor (16.67 %), and Aspergillus fumigatus (27.78 %). Headache and facial pain (77.8 %), facial paresthesia (55.6 %), and ophthalmoplegia (33.3 %) were the most common symptoms and signs. Computed tomography and endoscopic findings showed various stages of sinonasal (100 %), pterygopalatine fossa (55.56 %), orbital (44.45 %), and cerebral (5.56 %) involvement. All patients underwent serial surgical debridement (3.78 +/- 1.80 times; range 2-8) simultaneously with systemic antifungal therapy and proper management of the underlying disease. The most extreme case with brain involvement survived and recovered with no evidence of recurrent disease following treatment. All patients were considered cured after two endoscopic negative histopathologic evaluations. Three patients (16.67 %) died, one from uncontrolled leukemia and two due to renal failure. AIFRS is a potentially fatal condition, however, early diagnosis and management of the underlying disease accompanied with systemic antifungal and aggressive serial surgical intervention appears to be effective in reducing mortality in most patients.","['Bakhshaee, Mehdi', 'Bojdi, Amin', 'Allahyari, Abolghasem', 'Majidi, Mohammad Reza', 'Tavakol, Sherwin', 'Najafzadeh, Mohammad Javad', 'Asghari, Masoud']","['Bakhshaee M', 'Bojdi A', 'Allahyari A', 'Majidi MR', 'Tavakol S', 'Najafzadeh MJ', 'Asghari M']","['Sinus and Surgical Endoscopic Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Infectious Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Hematology-Oncology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Medical Mycology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Birjand University of Medicine, Birjand, Iran. masasghari58@bums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160607,Germany,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,9002937,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Debridement', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Endoscopy', 'Female', 'Headache/etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*diagnosis', 'Nasal Mucosa/microbiology', 'Rhinitis/complications/*microbiology', 'Sinusitis/complications/*microbiology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Diabetes mellitus', '*Immunocompromised', '*Invasive fungal rhinosinusitis', '*Leukemia']",2016/06/09 06:00,2017/04/11 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00405-016-4109-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00405-016-4109-z [pii]']",ppublish,Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol. 2016 Dec;273(12):4281-4287. doi: 10.1007/s00405-016-4109-z.

Being over-expressed in a range of cancers, it is a suitable target for cell-based immunotherapy. Gene transfer of T-cell receptor sequences cognisant of HLA-A*0201-restricted Aurora Kinase A antigen has previously been shown to transfer specific immunoreactivity against the target peptide in a Human Lymphocyte Antigen-restricted manner. While T cell receptor gene-transfer has great potential in overcoming the difficulties of isolating and expanding tumour-reactive lymphocytes from a patient's own cells, one hurdle is potential mispairing and competition between exogenous and endogenous T cell receptor chains. We have used a retroviral vector design bearing a short-interfering RNA that downregulates endogenous T cell receptor chains, without affecting expression of the transgenic T cell receptor sequences. The T cell receptor expression cassette also includes a 2A self-cleaving peptide, resulting in equimolar expression of the T cell receptor alpha and beta chains, further enhancing formation of the desired T cell receptor. Via a simple, modular cloning method, we have cloned the alpha and beta chains of the anti-Aurora Kinase A-reactive T cell receptor into this 'siTCR' vector. We then compared the activity of this vector against the original, 'conventional' vector across a panel of assays. T cell receptors expressed from the siTCR-vector retained the cytotoxic functionality of the original vector, with evidence of reduced off-target reactivity. The rate of expression of correctly-formed T cell receptors was superior using the siTCR design, and this was achieved at lower vector copy numbers. Maintaining T cell receptor efficacy with a reduced vector copy number reduces the risk of genotoxicity. The siTCR design also reduces the risk of mispairing and cross-reactivity, while increasing the functional titre. Such improvements in the safety of T cell receptor gene-transfer will be crucial for clinical applications of this technology.","['Casey, Nicholas Paul', 'Fujiwara, Hiroshi', 'Tanimoto, Kazushi', 'Okamoto, Sachiko', 'Mineno, Junichi', 'Kuzushima, Kiyotaka', 'Shiku, Hiroshi', 'Yasukawa, Masaki']","['Casey NP', 'Fujiwara H', 'Tanimoto K', 'Okamoto S', 'Mineno J', 'Kuzushima K', 'Shiku H', 'Yasukawa M']","['Department of Hematology, Clinical Immunology and Infectious Disease, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Clinical Immunology and Infectious Disease, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Clinical Immunology and Infectious Disease, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.', 'CDM Centre, Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan.', 'CDM Centre, Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan.', 'Division of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Vaccine and Immuno-Gene Therapy, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Mie, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Clinical Immunology and Infectious Disease, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160607,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AURKA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)']",IM,"['Aurora Kinase A/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",,,2016/06/09 06:00,2017/07/27 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2015/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0156896 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-39354 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jun 7;11(6):e0156896. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0156896. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0156896 [doi],,PMC4896450,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This case series describes 5 pediatric/adolescent patients who developed oral PG after HCT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Fanconi anemia, nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma, or junctional epidermolysis bullosa. The underlying mechanism for the appearance of oral PG after HCT is unknown, but it is suggested that calcineurin inhibitors used for graft versus host disease (GVHD) may play a role, as all patients were on cyclosporine A or tacrolimus at the time of development of oral PG. Three of the patients were being treated for chronic GVHD, and 1 other treated for acute GVHD. Overall, this report illustrates that PG should be considered in the differential diagnoses when encountering oral lesions in pediatric/adolescent patients after undergoing HCT, especially in the context of chronic GVHD and calcineurin inhibitors use.","['Cheney-Peters, Dianna', 'Lund, Troy C']","['Cheney-Peters D', 'Lund TC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['0 (Calcineurin Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Calcineurin Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy', 'Granuloma, Pyogenic/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mouth Diseases/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy']",,,2016/06/09 06:00,2017/08/31 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000593 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2016 Oct;38(7):570-3. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000593.,10.1097/MPH.0000000000000593 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we investigated how Smad4 modulates HSC fate at distinct stages of OB development. For this, we conditionally knocked out Smad4 in cells expressing type I collagen (Col1a1) and osteocalcin (OC), respectively. Col1a1-expressing OBs were widely present in both the trabecular and cortical compartment, whereas OC-expressing OBs were predominantly located in the cortical compartment. HSCs from Col1a1 mutants displayed senescence-associated phenotypes. OC mutants did not exhibit HSC senescence-related phenotypes, but instead showed preferential HSC death. Of note, stromal cell-derived factor 1 expression was lower in Col1a1 mutants than control littermates, suggesting potential impairment of CXCR4-CXCL12-mediated HSC retention. Disruption of the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis by AMD3100 administration led to an increase in the senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and low competitive potential. Collectively, our findings indicate that deletion of Smad4 in OBs differentially modulates HSC fate in a stage-dependent manner.","['Kook, S-H', 'Yun, C-Y', 'Sim, H-J', 'Bhattarai, G', 'Lee, B-C', 'Lee, K-Y', 'Cho, E-S', 'Lee, J-C']","['Kook SH', 'Yun CY', 'Sim HJ', 'Bhattarai G', 'Lee BC', 'Lee KY', 'Cho ES', 'Lee JC']","['Department of Bioactive Material Sciences, Institute for Molecular Biology and Genetics, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, South Korea.', 'Cluster for Craniofacial Development and Regeneration Research, Institute of Oral Bioscience and School of Dentistry, Chonbuk National University School of Dentistry, Jeonju, South Korea.', 'Cluster for Craniofacial Development and Regeneration Research, Institute of Oral Bioscience and School of Dentistry, Chonbuk National University School of Dentistry, Jeonju, South Korea.', 'Department of Bioactive Material Sciences, Institute for Molecular Biology and Genetics, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, South Korea.', 'Cluster for Craniofacial Development and Regeneration Research, Institute of Oral Bioscience and School of Dentistry, Chonbuk National University School of Dentistry, Jeonju, South Korea.', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Cluster for Craniofacial Development and Regeneration Research, Institute of Oral Bioscience and School of Dentistry, Chonbuk National University School of Dentistry, Jeonju, South Korea.', 'Cluster for Craniofacial Development and Regeneration Research, Institute of Oral Bioscience and School of Dentistry, Chonbuk National University School of Dentistry, Jeonju, South Korea.', 'Department of Bioactive Material Sciences, Institute for Molecular Biology and Genetics, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, South Korea.', 'Cluster for Craniofacial Development and Regeneration Research, Institute of Oral Bioscience and School of Dentistry, Chonbuk National University School of Dentistry, Jeonju, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160520,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain)', '0 (Smad4 Protein)', '0 (Smad4 protein, mouse)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancellous Bone/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Collagen Type I/metabolism', 'Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain', 'Cortical Bone/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Osteoblasts/chemistry/*cytology', 'Osteocalcin/metabolism', 'Smad4 Protein/genetics/*physiology']",,,2016/06/09 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2015/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016133 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.133 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Oct;30(10):2039-2046. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.133.

MMCT allows not only for genetic/epigenetic analysis of specific chromosomes, but also for utilization of human and mouse artificial chromosomes (HACs/MACs) as gene delivery vectors. Although the scientific demand for genome scale analyses is increasing, the poor transfer efficiency of the current method has hampered the application of chromosome engineering technology. Here, we developed a highly efficient chromosome transfer method, called retro-MMCT, which is based on Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing envelope proteins derived from ecotropic or amphotropic murine leukemia viruses. Using this method, we transferred MACs to NIH3T3 cells with 26.5 times greater efficiency than that obtained using the conventional MMCT method. Retro-MMCT was applicable to a variety of recipient cells, including embryonic stem cells. Moreover, retro-MMCT enabled efficient transfer of MAC to recipient cells derived from humans, monkeys, mice, rats, and rabbits. These results demonstrate the utility of retro-MMCT for the efficient transfer of chromosomes to various types of target cell.","['Suzuki, Teruhiko', 'Kazuki, Yasuhiro', 'Oshimura, Mitsuo', 'Hara, Takahiko']","['Suzuki T', 'Kazuki Y', 'Oshimura M', 'Hara T']","['Stem Cell Project, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Institute of Regenerative Medicine and Biofunction, Graduate School of Medical Science, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan.', 'Chromosome Engineering Research Center, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan.', 'Chromosome Engineering Research Center, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan.', 'Stem Cell Project, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160607,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Gene Products, env)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Chromosomes, Artificial/*genetics', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Rabbits', 'Rats']",,,2016/06/09 06:00,2017/07/27 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0157187 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-12671 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jun 7;11(6):e0157187. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0157187. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0157187 [doi],,PMC4896634,,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8162-8809'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

At diagnosis, no more than 5% of patients carry the 17p deletion, most cases harbour mutations within the other TP53 allele. The incidence of a TP53 mutation as the only alteration is approximately 5%, but this depends on the sensitivity of the technique. Recently, having a complex karyotype has been considered a strong adverse prognostic factor. However, there are no longitudinal studies simultaneously examining the presence of the 17p deletion, TP53 mutations and karyotype abnormalities. We conducted a retrospective longitudinal study of 31 relapsed/refractory CLL patients. Two to six blood samples per patient were analyzed, with a median follow-up of 8 years. In this report, we assessed the sequence of events of TP53 clonal evolution and correlated the presence of TP53 abnormalities to genetic instability during progression and treatment. Next-generation sequencing allowed the early detection of TP53 mutated clones and was able to be performed on a routine basis, demonstrating an excellent correlation between the Illumina and Ion Torrent technologies.

Hence, there is an urgent need for novel therapies. PIM kinases are often overexpressed in AML and DLBCL and are therefore an attractive therapeutic target. However, in vitro experiments have demonstrated that intrinsic resistance to PIM inhibition is common. It is therefore likely that only a minority of patients will benefit from single agent PIM inhibitor treatment. In this study, we performed an shRNA-based genetic screen to identify kinases whose suppression is synergistic with PIM inhibition. Here, we report that suppression of p38alpha (MAPK14) is synthetic lethal with the PIM kinase inhibitor AZD1208. PIM inhibition elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which subsequently activates p38alpha and downstream AKT/mTOR signaling. We found that p38alpha inhibitors sensitize hematological tumor cell lines to AZD1208 treatment in vitro and in vivo. These results were validated in ex vivo patient-derived AML cells. Our findings provide mechanistic and translational evidence supporting the rationale to test a combination of p38alpha and PIM inhibitors in clinical trials for AML and DLBCL.","['Brunen, Diede', 'Garcia-Barchino, Maria Jose', 'Malani, Disha', 'Jagalur Basheer, Noorjahan', 'Lieftink, Cor', 'Beijersbergen, Roderick L', 'Murumagi, Astrid', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Wolf, Maija', 'Zwaan, C Michel', 'Fornerod, Maarten', 'Kallioniemi, Olli', 'Martinez-Climent, Jose Angel', 'Bernards, Rene']","['Brunen D', 'Garcia-Barchino MJ', 'Malani D', 'Jagalur Basheer N', 'Lieftink C', 'Beijersbergen RL', 'Murumagi A', 'Porkka K', 'Wolf M', 'Zwaan CM', 'Fornerod M', 'Kallioniemi O', 'Martinez-Climent JA', 'Bernards R']","['Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Oncology, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus Medical Center/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Division of Oncology, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.', 'Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (proto-oncogene proteins pim)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'AZD1208', 'PIM', 'p38', 'resistance']",2016/10/23 06:00,2018/02/03 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/03 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['9822 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9822 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 21;7(25):37407-37419. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9822.,10.18632/oncotarget.9822 [doi],,PMC5122321,['The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CN is a preleukemic syndrome with a risk of approximately 20% to develop leukemia. More than 80% of CN patients who develop acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome reveal CSF3R mutations, suggesting that they are involved in leukemogenesis. Using deep-sequencing technology, we were able to analyze large cohorts of CN patients for the entire CSF3R sequence as well as to identify cell clones carrying mutations in the intracellular part of CSF3R with very high sensitivity. Acquisition of CSF3R mutations is a CN-specific phenomenon and is associated with inherited mutations causing CN or cyclic neutropenia, such as ELANE mutations. In the group of CN patients negative for known germ-line mutations, biallelic CSF3R mutations were identified. In addition, CSF3R mutant clones are highly dynamic and may disappear and reappear during continuous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy. The time between the first detection of CSF3R mutations and overt leukemia is highly variable.","['Klimiankou, Maksim', 'Mellor-Heineke, Sabine', 'Zeidler, Cornelia', 'Welte, Karl', 'Skokowa, Julia']","['Klimiankou M', 'Mellor-Heineke S', 'Zeidler C', 'Welte K', 'Skokowa J']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Pulmonology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Tubingen, Germany."", 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Pulmonology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (CSF3R protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Neutropenia/complications/*congenital/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CSF3R mutations', '*deep sequencing', '*severe congenital neutropenia']",2016/06/09 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/nyas.13097 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2016 Apr;1370(1):119-25. doi: 10.1111/nyas.13097.,10.1111/nyas.13097 [doi],,,,,,['(c) 2016 New York Academy of Sciences.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database revealed that MTGs were mutated in epithelial malignancy and suggested that loss of function might promote tumorigenesis. Genetic deletion of MTGR1 and MTG16 in the mouse has revealed unexpected and unique roles within the intestinal epithelium. Mtgr1(-/-) mice have progressive depletion of all intestinal secretory cells, and Mtg16(-/-) mice have a decrease in goblet cells. Furthermore, both Mtgr1(-/-) and Mtg16(-/-) mice have increased intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. We thus hypothesized that loss of MTGR1 or MTG16 would modify Apc(1638/+)-dependent intestinal tumorigenesis. Mtgr1(-/-) mice, but not Mtg16(-/-) mice, had a 10-fold increase in tumor multiplicity. This was associated with more advanced dysplasia, including progression to invasive adenocarcinoma, and augmented intratumoral proliferation. Analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data sets for MTGR1 and MTG16 targets indicated that MTGR1 can regulate Wnt and Notch signaling. In support of this, immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis revealed that both Wnt and Notch signaling pathways were hyperactive in Mtgr1(-/-) tumors.

We recently reported that targeting a key oxidative PPP enzyme, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), using our novel small-molecule 6PGD inhibitors Physcion and its derivative S3, shows anticancer effects. Notably, humans with genetic deficiency of either 6PGD or another oxidative PPP enzyme, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, exhibit non-immune hemolytic anemia upon exposure to aspirin and various antimalarial drugs. Inspired by these clinical observations, we examined the anticancer potential of combined treatment with 6PGD inhibitors and antimalarial drugs. We found that stable knockdown of 6PGD sensitizes leukemia cells to antimalarial agent dihydroartemisinin (DHA). Combined treatment with DHA and Physcion activates AMP-activated protein kinase, leading to synergistic inhibition of human leukemia cell viability. Moreover, our combined therapy synergistically attenuates tumor growth in xenograft nude mice injected with human K562 leukemia cells and cell viability of primary leukemia cells from human patients, but shows minimal toxicity to normal hematopoietic cells in mice as well as red blood cells and mononucleocytes from healthy human donors. Our findings reveal the potential for combined therapy using optimized doses of Physcion and DHA as a novel antileukemia treatment without inducing hemolysis.","['Elf, S', 'Lin, R', 'Xia, S', 'Pan, Y', 'Shan, C', 'Wu, S', 'Lonial, S', 'Gaddh, M', 'Arellano, M L', 'Khoury, H J', 'Khuri, F R', 'Lee, B H', 'Boggon, T J', 'Fan, J', 'Chen, J']","['Elf S', 'Lin R', 'Xia S', 'Pan Y', 'Shan C', 'Wu S', 'Lonial S', 'Gaddh M', 'Arellano ML', 'Khoury HJ', 'Khuri FR', 'Lee BH', 'Boggon TJ', 'Fan J', 'Chen J']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160606,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Artemisinins)', '6A9O50735X (artenimol)', 'EC 1.1.1.43 (Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase)', 'H6PT94IV61 (physcione)', 'KA46RNI6HN (Emodin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimalarials/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Artemisinins/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Emodin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Pentose Phosphate Pathway/*drug effects', 'Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2016/06/09 06:00,2017/09/01 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2015/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016196 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.196 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Jan 12;36(2):254-262. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.196.

The objective of this study was to explore the role of Sirt3 in the mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), a process of the specific autophagic elimination of damaged mitochondria. We found that silencing of Sirt3 expression in human glioma cells by RNA interference blunted the hypoxia-induced the localization of LC3 on the mitochondria, and the degradation of mitochondria. These results suggest an important involvement of this protein deacetylase in the induction of mitophagy in cancer cells subjected to hypoxia. Further, we demonstrated that Sirt3 activated the hypoxia-induced mitophagy by increasing the interaction of VDAC1 with Parkin. In the cells subjected to hypoxia, inhibition of Sirt3-mediated mitophagy further decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased the accumulation of ROS that triggers the degradation of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and survivin through the proteasomal pathway. Silencing of Sirt3 expression also promoted apoptosis, and enhanced the sensitivity of cancer cells to hypoxia. The regulatory role of Sirt3 in autophagy and apoptosis was also observed in human breast cancer cells. The results of the current study reveal Sirt3 as a novel regulator coupling mitophagy and apoptosis, two important cellular processes that determine cellular survival and death.","['Qiao, Aimin', 'Wang, Kuansong', 'Yuan, Yunsheng', 'Guan, Yidi', 'Ren, Xingcong', 'Li, Lanya', 'Chen, Xisha', 'Li, Feng', 'Chen, Alex F', 'Zhou, Jianda', 'Yang, Jin-Ming', 'Cheng, Yan']","['Qiao A', 'Wang K', 'Yuan Y', 'Guan Y', 'Ren X', 'Li L', 'Chen X', 'Li F', 'Chen AF', 'Zhou J', 'Yang JM', 'Cheng Y']","['Center for Bioresources and Drug Discovery and School of Bioscience and Biopharmaceutics, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Basic Medical School, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Cell and Therapeutic Antibody, Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, The Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine and Milton S.

However, long-term persistence of T cells targeting CD19, a pan-B cell marker, also depletes normal B cells and causes severe hypogammaglobulinemia. Here, we developed a strategy to target B cell malignancies more selectively by taking advantage of B cell light Ig chain restriction. We generated a CAR that is specific for the kappa light chain (kappa.CAR) and therefore recognizes kappa-restricted cells and spares the normal B cells expressing the nontargeted lambda light chain, thus potentially minimizing humoral immunity impairment. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 clinical trial and treated 16 patients with relapsed or refractory kappa+ non-Hodgkin lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (NHL/CLL) or multiple myeloma (MM) with autologous T cells genetically modified to express kappa.CAR (kappa.CARTs). Other treatments were discontinued in 11 of the 16 patients at least 4 weeks prior to T cell infusion. Six patients without lymphopenia received 12.5 mg/kg cyclophosphamide 4 days before kappa.CART infusion (0.2 x 108 to 2 x 108 kappa.CARTs/m2). No other lymphodepletion was used. RESULTS: kappa.CART expansion peaked 1-2 weeks after infusion, and cells remained detectable for more than 6 weeks. Of 9 patients with relapsed NHL or CLL, 2 entered complete remission after 2 and 3 infusions of kappa.CARTs, and 1 had a partial response. Of 7 patients with MM, 4 had stable disease lasting 2-17 months. No toxicities attributable to kappa.CARTs were observed. CONCLUSION: kappa.CART infusion is feasible and safe and can lead to complete clinical responses. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00881920.

This is particularly true with Medicare Part D, where after meeting a deductible, patients without low-income subsidies (non-LIS) typically face 25% to 33% coinsurance (initial coverage phase with ""specialty tier"" cost sharing), followed by ~50% coinsurance (coverage gap phase), and then 5% coinsurance (catastrophic phase). Yet, no studies have examined the impact of such high cost sharing on specialty drug initiation under Part D. Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), making it an apt case study. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective claims-based analysis utilizing 2011 to 2013 100% Medicare claims. METHODS: TKI initiation rates and time to initiation were compared between fee-for-service non-LIS Part D patients newly diagnosed with CML and their LIS counterparts who faced nominal cost sharing of </= $5. RESULTS: The first 30-day TKI fill ""straddled"" benefit phases, for a mean out-of-pocket cost of $2600 or more for non-LIS patients. Non-LIS patients were less likely than LIS patients to have a TKI claim within 6 months of diagnosis (45.3% vs 66.9%; P < .001) and those initiating a TKI took twice as long to fill it (mean = 50.9 vs 23.7 days; P < .001). Cox regressions controlling for sociodemographic, clinical, and plan characteristics confirmed descriptive findings (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.45-0.76). Extensive sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our findings. CONCLUSIONS: High cost sharing was associated with reduced and/or delayed initiation of TKIs. We discuss policy strategies to reduce current financial barriers that adversely impact access to critical therapies under Medicare Part D.","['Doshi, Jalpa A', 'Li, Pengxiang', 'Huo, Hairong', 'Pettit, Amy R', 'Kumar, Rishab', 'Weiss, Brenda M', 'Huntington, Scott F']","['Doshi JA', 'Li P', 'Huo H', 'Pettit AR', 'Kumar R', 'Weiss BM', 'Huntington SF']","['University of Pennsylvania, 1223 Blockley Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104.

Minimal residual disease (MRD) levels during the first months predict outcome and may select patients for therapy reduction or intensification. METHODS: Patients 1 to 18 years old with ALL were stratified on the basis of MRD levels after the first and second course of chemotherapy. Thereafter, therapy was substantially reduced in patients with undetectable MRD (standard risk) and intensified in patients with intermediate (medium risk) and high (high risk) levels of MRD. Seven hundred seventy-eight consecutive patients were enrolled. The method of analysis was intention-to-treat. Outcome was compared with historical controls. RESULTS: In MRD-based standard-risk patients, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 93% (SE 2%), the 5-year survival rate was 99% (SE 1%), and the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse rate was 6% (SE 2%). The safety upper limit of number of observation years was reached and therapy reduction was declared safe.MRD-based medium-risk patients had a significantly higher 5-year EFS rate (88%, SE 2%) with therapy intensification (including 30 weeks of asparaginase exposure and dexamethasone/vincristine pulses) compared with historical controls (76%, SE 6%). Intensive chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation in MRD-based high-risk patients resulted in a significantly better 5-year EFS rate (78%, SE 8% v 16%, SE 8% in controls). Overall outcome improved significantly (5-year EFS rate 87%, 5-year survival rate 92%, and 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse rate 8%) compared with preceding Dutch Childhood Oncology Group protocols. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy was substantially reduced safely in one-quarter of children with ALL who were selected on the basis of undetectable MRD levels, without jeopardizing the survival rate. Outcomes of patients with intermediate and high levels of MRD improved with therapy intensification.","['Pieters, Rob', 'de Groot-Kruseman, Hester', 'Van der Velden, Vincent', 'Fiocco, Marta', 'van den Berg, Henk', 'de Bont, Evelien', 'Egeler, R Maarten', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter', 'Kaspers, Gertjan', 'Van der Schoot, Ellen', 'De Haas, Valerie', 'Van Dongen, Jacques']","['Pieters R', 'de Groot-Kruseman H', 'Van der Velden V', 'Fiocco M', 'van den Berg H', 'de Bont E', 'Egeler RM', 'Hoogerbrugge P', 'Kaspers G', 'Van der Schoot E', 'De Haas V', 'Van Dongen J']","['Rob Pieters, Peter Hoogerbrugge, and Gertjan Kaspers, Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht; Rob Pieters, Hester de Groot-Kruseman, Marta Fiocco, and Valerie De Haas, Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague; Vincent Van der Velden and Jacques Van Dongen, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam; Marta Fiocco, Leiden University, Leiden; Henk van den Berg, Academic Medical Center; Gertjan Kaspers, Free University Hospital Amsterdam; Ellen Van der Schoot, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam; Evelien de Bont, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands; and R.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed infectious complications in children during intensive treatment of AML according to the AML-BFM 2004 trial and surveyed sites on institutional standards regarding recommended restrictions of social contacts (six items), pets (five items), and food (eight items). A scoring system was developed with a restriction score for each item. Multivariable Poisson regression adjusted for sex, age, weight group, risk stratification, and prophylactic antibiotics was used to estimate the impact of the restrictions on the incidence ratios of fever of unknown origin, bacteremia, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis. RESULTS: Data on recommendations of nonpharmacologic anti-infective measures and infectious complications were available in 339 patients treated in 37 institutions. Analyses did not demonstrate a significant benefit of any of the restrictions regarding food, social contacts, and pets on the risk of fever, bacteremia, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis. In contrast, age, weight group, risk stratification, and nonabsorbable antibiotics had some influence on infections complications. CONCLUSION: The lack of effectiveness of dietary restrictions and restrictions regarding social contacts and pets should result in reconsideration of anti-infective policies.","['Tramsen, Lars', 'Salzmann-Manrique, Emilia', 'Bochennek, Konrad', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Lehrnbecher, Thomas']","['Tramsen L', 'Salzmann-Manrique E', 'Bochennek K', 'Klingebiel T', 'Reinhardt D', 'Creutzig U', 'Sung L', 'Lehrnbecher T']","[""Lars Tramsen, Emilia Salzmann-Manrique, Konrad Bochennek, Thomas Klingebiel, and Thomas Lehrnbecher, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt; Dirk Reinhardt, Medical Center, University of Essen, Essen; Ursula Creutzig, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; and Lillian Sung, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada."", ""Lars Tramsen, Emilia Salzmann-Manrique, Konrad Bochennek, Thomas Klingebiel, and Thomas Lehrnbecher, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt; Dirk Reinhardt, Medical Center, University of Essen, Essen; Ursula Creutzig, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; and Lillian Sung, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada."", ""Lars Tramsen, Emilia Salzmann-Manrique, Konrad Bochennek, Thomas Klingebiel, and Thomas Lehrnbecher, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt; Dirk Reinhardt, Medical Center, University of Essen, Essen; Ursula Creutzig, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; and Lillian Sung, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada."", ""Lars Tramsen, Emilia Salzmann-Manrique, Konrad Bochennek, Thomas Klingebiel, and Thomas Lehrnbecher, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt; Dirk Reinhardt, Medical Center, University of Essen, Essen; Ursula Creutzig, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; and Lillian Sung, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada."", ""Lars Tramsen, Emilia Salzmann-Manrique, Konrad Bochennek, Thomas Klingebiel, and Thomas Lehrnbecher, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt; Dirk Reinhardt, Medical Center, University of Essen, Essen; Ursula Creutzig, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; and Lillian Sung, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada."", ""Lars Tramsen, Emilia Salzmann-Manrique, Konrad Bochennek, Thomas Klingebiel, and Thomas Lehrnbecher, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt; Dirk Reinhardt, Medical Center, University of Essen, Essen; Ursula Creutzig, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; and Lillian Sung, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada."", ""Lars Tramsen, Emilia Salzmann-Manrique, Konrad Bochennek, Thomas Klingebiel, and Thomas Lehrnbecher, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt; Dirk Reinhardt, Medical Center, University of Essen, Essen; Ursula Creutzig, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; and Lillian Sung, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada."", ""Lars Tramsen, Emilia Salzmann-Manrique, Konrad Bochennek, Thomas Klingebiel, and Thomas Lehrnbecher, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt; Dirk Reinhardt, Medical Center, University of Essen, Essen; Ursula Creutzig, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; and Lillian Sung, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. thomas.lehrnbecher@kgu.de.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160606,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Diet', 'Female', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Gastroenteritis/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infection Control/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/diet therapy', '*Pets', 'Pneumonia/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Risk Factors', '*Social Participation']",,,2016/06/09 06:00,2017/07/27 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2016.66.7881 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2016.66.7881 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2016 Aug 10;34(23):2776-83. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2016.66.7881.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This longitudinal study linked pharmacokinetic assays collected during therapy to neurocognitive and brain imaging outcomes during long-term follow-up. A total of 218 (72.2%) of 302 eligible long-term survivors were recruited for outcome studies when they were more than 5 years post-diagnosis and older than 8 years of age. At long-term follow-up, survivors were an average of 13.8 years old and 7.7 years from diagnosis, and 51% were male. Neurocognitive testing, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during an executive function task, and structural MRI with diffusion tensor imaging were conducted. Generalized linear models were developed to identify predictors, and models were adjusted for age at diagnosis, sex, and parent education. RESULTS: Intelligence was within normal limits (mean, 98; standard deviation, 14) compared with population expectations (mean, 100; standard deviation, 15), though measures of executive function, processing speed, and memory were less than population means (all P < .02 after correction for false discovery rates). Higher plasma concentration of methotrexate was associated with a poorer executive function score (P < .02). Higher plasma methotrexate was also associated with higher functional MRI activity, with thicker cortices in dorsolateral prefrontal brain regions, and with white matter microstructure in the frontostriatal tact. Neurocognitive impairment was associated with these imaging findings as well. Associations did not change after adjustment for age or dose of leucovorin rescue. CONCLUSION: Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated on contemporary chemotherapy-only protocols demonstrate executive dysfunction. A higher plasma concentration of methotrexate was associated with executive dysfunction as well as with a thicker cortex and higher activity in frontal brain regions, regions often associated with executive function.","['Krull, Kevin R', 'Cheung, Yin Ting', 'Liu, Wei', 'Fellah, Slim', 'Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Brinkman, Tara M', 'Kimberg, Cara', 'Ogg, Robert', 'Srivastava, Deokumar', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Hudson, Melissa M']","['Krull KR', 'Cheung YT', 'Liu W', 'Fellah S', 'Reddick WE', 'Brinkman TM', 'Kimberg C', 'Ogg R', 'Srivastava D', 'Pui CH', 'Robison LL', 'Hudson MM']","[""All authors: St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN kevin.krull@stjude.org."", ""All authors: St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""All authors: St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""All authors: St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""All authors: St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""All authors: St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""All authors: St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""All authors: St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""All authors: St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""All authors: St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""All authors: St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""All authors: St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160606,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', '*Executive Function', 'Female', 'Frontal Lobe/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intelligence', 'Linear Models', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/blood', '*Neuroimaging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/physiopathology/therapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/06/09 06:00,2017/07/28 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2015.65.4574 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2015.65.4574 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2016 Aug 1;34(22):2644-53. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2015.65.4574.

The aim of the study was to screen the entire cattle genome to identify markers and candidate genes that might be involved in host response to bovine leukemia virus infection. A genome-wide association study was performed using Holstein cows naturally infected by BLV. A data set included 43 cows (BLV positive) and 30 cows (BLV negative) genotyped for 54,609 SNP markers (Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip). The BLV status of cows was determined by serum ELISA, nested-PCR and hematological counts. Linear Regression Analysis with a False Discovery Rate and kinship matrix (computed on the autosomal SNPs) was calculated to find out which SNP markers significantly differentiate BLV-positive and BLV-negative cows. Nine markers reached genome-wide significance. The most significant SNPs were located on chromosomes 23 (rs41583098), 3 (rs109405425, rs110785500) and 8 (rs43564499) in close vicinity of a patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 1 (PNPLA1); adaptor-related protein complex 4, beta 1 subunit (AP4B1); tripartite motif-containing 45 (TRIM45) and cell division cycle associated 2 (CDCA2) genes, respectively. Furthermore, a list of 41 candidate genes was composed based on their proximity to significant markers (within a distance of ca. 1 Mb) and functional involvement in processes potentially underlying BLV-induced pathogenesis. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that host response to BLV infection involves nine sub-regions of the cattle genome (represented by 9 SNP markers), containing many genes which, based on the literature, could be involved to enzootic bovine leukemia progression. New group of promising candidate genes associated with the host response to BLV infection were identified and could therefore be a target for future studies. The functions of candidate genes surrounding significant SNP markers imply that there is no single regulatory process that is solely targeted by BLV infection, but rather the network of interrelated pathways is deregulated, leading to the disruption of the control of B-cell proliferation and programmed cell death.","['Brym, P', 'Bojarojc-Nosowicz, B', 'Olenski, K', 'Hering, D M', 'Rusc, A', 'Kaczmarczyk, E', 'Kaminski, S']","['Brym P', 'Bojarojc-Nosowicz B', 'Olenski K', 'Hering DM', 'Rusc A', 'Kaczmarczyk E', 'Kaminski S']","['Department of Animal Genetics, University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Oczapowskiego 5, 10-719 Olsztyn, Poland.

This association has provided the impetus to customize anti-leukemia therapy based on MRD data, a strategy that is now routinely pursued in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). While it is currently uncertain whether this approach will improve outcomes in AML other than APL, randomized studies have validated MRD-based risk-stratified treatment algorithms in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here, we review the available studies examining MRD-directed therapy in AML, appraise their strengths and limitations, and discuss avenues for future investigation.","['Pettit, Kristen', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Pettit K', 'Stock W', 'Walter RB']","['a Section of Hematology/Oncology and University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center , University of Chicago , Chicago , IL , USA ;', 'a Section of Hematology/Oncology and University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center , University of Chicago , Chicago , IL , USA ;', 'b Clinical Research Division , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , WA , USA ;', 'c Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology , University of Washington , Seattle , WA , USA ;', 'd Department of Epidemiology , University of Washington , Seattle , WA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*adult', '*measurable residual disease (MRD)', '*prognosis', '*risk-directed therapy']",2016/06/09 06:00,2017/12/23 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2016.1160085 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2016 Jul;57(7):1527-33. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2016.1160085.,10.3109/10428194.2016.1160085 [doi],"['T32 CA009566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007019/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4968046,,,,,,['NIHMS803190'],,,,,,,,,,

Pericardial effusion was analyzed macro- and microscopically. Examinations done in the cardiac surgical department revealed pericarditis secondary to infection (n=17) or autoimmunologic processes (n=2) and malignancy in 18 patients (predominantly of the lungs (n=11)). Pericardial effusion obtained from patients with viral and autoimmunologic-induced pericarditis was straw-color and odorless while with bacterial infections dark yellow, iridescent and usually malodorous. Additional workup in the regional hospitals enabled to reveal malignant tumors in 29 patients, leukemia or lymphoma in 5 subjects. In all but one of the neoplastic cases, pericardial fluid was turbid and dark red or plummy. In 10 patients etiology of tamponade remained unknown. In conclusion, cardiac tamponade in previously healthy patients may be occasionally the predominant symptom of cancer, especially of the lungs.

Allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has proven curative potential with ability to overcome adverse prognostic factors, however due to its toxicity it is generally perceived as the last option. We performed retrospective study to explore the outcomes and possible determinants of survival in the unselected consecutive cohort of 68 CLL patients (median age 59 years) receiving reduced intensity HCT as a part of salvage therapy in 2 Czech centers. The median interval from diagnosis to HCT was 69 months with median 3 of prior regimens, all patients were refractory to purine analogues. 49% of patients were transplanted with advanced (i.e. refractory or progressive disease or CR/PR>3), 38% had high risk cytogenetics. With median follow-up of 35 months the 3-year Kaplan-Meier survival probability for OS and PFS were 39% and 26%, respectively. Altogether 18 patients (26%) have relapsed or progressed. During the follow-up 41 patients died, 32 (78%) of transplant related factors (NRM), the others of relapse or disease progression.Univariate analysis failed to identify any clinical and pre- or post-transplant variables having clear prognostic significance for OS or PFS. The marginal OS advantage favoring HCT performed recently was detected (3-year OS: 31% for HCT until 2006 and 47% thereafter, p=0.0923). In multivariable hazards model only the female donors were associated with shorter OS (HR 2.278, p=0.016) whereas transplanted T-cell> 2.75x108/kg predicted inferior PFS(HR 1.957, p=0.035). No prognostic impact of donor type, age of donor and recipient, HLA mismatch, disease status pre-HCT, number of previous therapy lines, interval from dg. to HCT and number of transplanted hematopoietic cells was found. Our findings support the conclusion that alloHCT is able to overcome well known negative cytogenetic prognostic factors and that preferring male to female donors could be beneficial.","['Jindra, P', 'Raida, L', 'Lysak, D', 'Karas, M', 'Papajik, T', 'Jungova, A', 'Mohammadova, L', 'Houdova, L']","['Jindra P', 'Raida L', 'Lysak D', 'Karas M', 'Papajik T', 'Jungova A', 'Mohammadova L', 'Houdova L']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic HCT', '*CLL', '*RIC', '*prognostic factors.']",2016/06/09 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4149/neo_2016_413 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasma. 2016;63(4):595-600. doi: 10.4149/neo_2016_413.,10.4149/neo_2016_413 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, MiRNAs are thought to play an important role in tumorigenesis. The miR146a G>C polymorphism can lead to alteration of miR146 expression, which appears to be associated with development and progression of several cancers. This study aimed to investigate the association of the miRNA146a (rs2910164) G>C polymorphism and susceptibility to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Totals of 100 childhood ALL patients and 200 healthy children were studied for miR146a polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: The frequency of the miR146a G allele in controls was 0.40 compared with 0.38 in ALL patients. There was no association between miRNA146a (rs2910164) G>C polymorphism and susceptibility to childhood ALL (OR=1.484, 95%CI=0.712-3.093, p=0.290). Moreover, the frequencies of miR146a (rs2910164) G>C polymorphism were not associated with demographic data and clinical outcomes in ALL cases.

A 27-year-old man developed T-LBL with a mediastinal mass. He exhibited several recurrences in the central nervous system and marrow. A fifth relapse occurred in the marrow, with 42.8% blasts with CD4, CD5, CD7, CD10, CD33, CD34, HLA-DR and cytoplasmic (cy) CD3. While achieving complete remission with nelarabine, sixth relapse occurred in the marrow with 6.8% blasts, which had characteristics of monoblastic features, 2 months later. Marrow blasts were positive for myeloperoxidase, CD4, CD33, CD56, CD64, and HLA-DR, but were negative for cyCD3, CD5, CD7, CD10, and CD34. Marrow cells at both the 5th lymphoid and 6th myeloid relapses had t(6;11)(q27;q23) and the same MLL-MLLT4 fusion transcript. In addition, the MLL-MLLT4 fusion sequences documented in the initial mediastinal cells were the same as seen in peripheral blood cells at the 6th relapse. The patient continues 7th remission after one course of gemtuzumab ozogamicin therapy followed by cord blood transplantation for more than 3 years. Sequential phenotypic and cytogenetic studies may yield valuable insights into the mechanism of leukemic recurrence and possible implications for treatment selection.","['Higuchi, Yusuke', 'Tokunaga, Kenji', 'Watanabe, Yuko', 'Kawakita, Toshiro', 'Harada, Naoko', 'Yamaguchi, Shunichiro', 'Nosaka, Kisato', 'Mitsuya, Hiroaki', 'Asou, Norio']","['Higuchi Y', 'Tokunaga K', 'Watanabe Y', 'Kawakita T', 'Harada N', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Nosaka K', 'Mitsuya H', 'Asou N']","['Department of Hematology, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto.', 'Department of Hematology, National Institute of Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto.', 'Department of Hematology, National Institute of Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto.', 'Cancer Center, Kumamoto University Hospital, Kumamoto.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto; Department of Hematology, International Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Saitama, Japan.

Upon androgen stimulation, AR recruits the Protein kinase N1 (PKN1), which phosphorylates histone H3 at threonine 11, with subsequent recruitment of tryptophan, aspartic acid (WD) repeat-containing protein 5 (WDR5) and the su(var)3-9, enhancer of zeste, trithorax/mixed-lineage leukemia (SET1/MLL) histone methyltransferase complex to promote AR target gene activation and prostate cancer cell growth. However, the underlying mechanisms of target gene activation and cell growth subsequent to WDR5 recruitment are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate an epigenetic cross talk between histone modifications and AR target gene regulation. We discovered that K(lysine) acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8), a member of the MOZ, YBF2/SAS2, and TIP 60 protein 1 (MYST) family of histone acetyltransferases that catalyzes histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation, colocalized with WDR5 at AR target genes, resulting in hormone-dependent gene activation in prostate cancer cells. PKN1 or WDR5 knockdown severely inhibited KAT8 association with AR target genes and histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation upon androgen treatment. Knockdown of KAT8 significantly decreased AR target gene expression and prostate cancer cell proliferation. Collectively, these data describe a trans-histone modification pathway involving PKN1/histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation followed by WDR5/MLL histone methyltransferase and KAT8/histone acetyltransferase recruitment to effect androgen-dependent gene activation and prostate cancer cell proliferation.","['Kim, Ji-Young', 'Yu, Jindan', 'Abdulkadir, Sarki A', 'Chakravarti, Debabrata']","['Kim JY', 'Yu J', 'Abdulkadir SA', 'Chakravarti D']","['Division of Reproductive Science in Medicine (J.-Y.K., D.C.), Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology; Division of Hematology/Oncology (J.Y.), Department of Medicine; Departments of Urology (S.A.A.), Pathology (S.A.A.), and Pharmacology (D.C.); and Robert H.

METHODS: FAERS was searched using each BTCT name as primary or secondary suspect drug and the adverse reaction of PML. Among BTCTs with >2 case reports of PML, proportional reporting ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Among 49 new BTCTs, 82 cases of PML were found for 16 drugs. Significant PRR signals were found among 7 (14.6%) BTCTs including: brentuximab (24.5, CI:14.8-40.6), ofatumumab (16.3, CI:9.6-27.4), alemtuzumab (9.9, CI:6.0-16.4), obinutuzumab (7.4, CI:2.4-22.8), ibrutinib (5.6 CI:3.0-10.5), belimumab (4.5 CI:2.3-9.0), and idelalisib (4.1, CI:1.3-12.6). Among the 82 cases with significant signals, confirmation of the diagnosis of PML using objective criteria was found in 56% of the cases. A limitation of FAERS data is that missing data are common. CONCLUSIONS: When using BTCTs, clinicians and patients consider the risk of PML versus the therapeutic benefit, particularly when used in combination with other drugs which may cause PML, such as rituximab. It is important to recognize that PML may occur in some conditions, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, regardless of drug therapy.","['Raisch, Dennis W', 'Rafi, John A', 'Chen, Cheng', 'Bennett, Charles L']","['Raisch DW', 'Rafi JA', 'Chen C', 'Bennett CL']","['a College of Pharmacy , University of New Mexico , Albuquerque , NM , USA.', 'a College of Pharmacy , University of New Mexico , Albuquerque , NM , USA.', 'a College of Pharmacy , University of New Mexico , Albuquerque , NM , USA.', 'b College of Pharmacy , Medical University of South Carolina , Charleston , SC , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160620,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biological Products)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Biological Products/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",['NOTNLM'],"[""FDA's adverse event reporting system"", 'Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy', 'biological drugs', 'data mining signal detection', 'targeted cancer therapies']",2016/06/09 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/14740338.2016.1198775 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2016 Aug;15(8):1003-11. doi: 10.1080/14740338.2016.1198775.

Reverse phase protein array suggested that high expression of the essential autophagy-related protein, Atg7, was associated with shorter remission in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples, indicating a role in chemoresistance. Knockdown of Atg7 in AML cells using short hairpin RNA markedly increased apoptosis and DNA damage following treatment with cytarabine and idarubicin. Interestingly, coculture of AML cells with stromal cells increased autophagy and chemoresistance in the AML cells exposed to chemotherapeutic agents, and this was reversed following Atg7 knockdown. This effect was further enhanced by concomitant knockdown of Atg7 in both AML and stromal cells. These findings strongly suggest that Atg7, and likely microenvironment autophagy in general, plays an important role in AML chemoresistance. Mechanistic studies revealed that Atg7 knockdown induced a proapoptotic phenotype in AML cells, which was manifested by an increased NOXA expression at the transcriptional level. Finally, in a mouse model of human leukemia, Atg7 knockdown extended overall survival after chemotherapy. Thus, the inhibition of Atg7 appears to be a valid strategy to enhance chemosensitivity, and it could indeed improve outcomes in AML therapy.","['Piya, Sujan', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Ruvolo, Vivian R', 'Mu, Hong', 'Ruvolo, Peter P', 'McQueen, Teresa', 'Davis, R Eric', 'Hail, Numsen Jr', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Borthakur, Gautam']","['Piya S', 'Kornblau SM', 'Ruvolo VR', 'Mu H', 'Ruvolo PP', 'McQueen T', 'Davis RE', 'Hail N Jr', 'Kantarjian H', 'Andreeff M', 'Borthakur G']","['Department of Leukemia, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, and.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, and.', 'Department of Leukemia, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, and.', 'Department of Leukemia, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, and.', 'Department of Leukemia, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, and.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, and.', 'Department of Leukemia, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160607,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Atg7 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Autophagy/drug effects/genetics', '*Autophagy-Related Protein 7/genetics/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2016/06/09 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34188-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-01-692244 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Sep 1;128(9):1260-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-01-692244.

However, the hierarchical organization of malignant clones in the hematopoiesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and its impact on response to drug therapy remain poorly understood. Using high-throughput sequencing of patient and xenografted cells, we evaluated the intratumoral heterogeneity (n= 54) and reconstructed mutational trajectories (n = 39) in patients suffering from MDS (n = 52) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-1 (n = 2). We identified linear and also branching evolution paths and confirmed on a patient-specific level that somatic mutations in epigenetic regulators and RNA splicing genes frequently constitute isolated disease-initiating events. Using high-throughput exome- and/or deep-sequencing, we analyzed 103 chronologically acquired samples from 22 patients covering a cumulative observation time of 75 years MDS disease progression. Our data revealed highly dynamic shaping of complex oligoclonal architectures, specifically upon treatment with lenalidomide and other drugs. Despite initial clinical response to treatment, patients' marrow persistently remained clonal with rapid outgrowth of founder-, sub-, or even fully independent clones, indicating an increased dynamic rate of clonal turnover. The emergence and disappearance of specific clones frequently correlated with changes of clinical parameters, highlighting their distinct and far-reaching functional properties. Intriguingly, increasingly complex mutational trajectories are frequently accompanied by clinical progression during the course of disease.

Several side effects have been reported, the most common being myelosuppression, diarrhea, edema, and nausea. Three papers have been published reporting hepatic side effects of dasatinib treatment. A rare side effect of dasatinib treatment is reactivation of latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Never before has dasatinib therapy shown to be the cause of CMV hepatitis in an immunocompetent patient. We present a case of an immunocompetent patient who was treated with the standard dose of dasatinib therapy and subsequently developed CMV hepatitis. Well-known side effects of dasatinib therapy are understood and documented; unknown adverse drug reactions can occur and should be monitored for.

Platelet counts >/=500 x 10(9)/L and hemoglobin levels >/=9 g/dL on day 28 after treatment initiation were significantly associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) rate, conferring respective multivariate risk ratios of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.18-0.79) and 0.60 (95% CI: 0.40-0.89) for the occurrence of relapse or death. No disease relapse occurred in core binding factor leukemia patients whose platelet counts recovered >/=500 x 10(9)/L at 28 days after therapy initiation.

Four series of compounds (compounds 7-10) were synthesized, and the BRD4-inhibitory activity and anti-proliferative effect of these compounds were evaluated. We found compound 10d has remarkable anti-proliferative activities toward leukemia cells and could induce apoptosis by mitochondrial pathways. Notably, the analysis of molecular docking suggested that hydrophobic interaction was essential for compound 10d to bind to BD1. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the potential of compound 10d to be utilized as a BRD4 inhibitor with apoptosis inducing effect in future leukemia therapy.","['Li, Jie', 'Wang, Peiqi', 'Zhou, Bihui', 'Shi, Jianyou', 'Liu, Jie', 'Li, Xiangrong', 'Fan, Limei', 'Zheng, Yaxin', 'Ouyang, Liang']","['Li J', 'Wang P', 'Zhou B', 'Shi J', 'Liu J', 'Li X', 'Fan L', 'Zheng Y', 'Ouyang L']","['School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, Hangzhou 310015, Zhejiang, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Stomatology, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.', 'School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, Hangzhou 310015, Zhejiang, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy & Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy & Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, China.', 'School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, Hangzhou 310015, Zhejiang, China.', 'School of Medicine, Zhejiang University City College, Hangzhou 310015, Zhejiang, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy & Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, China.

In this paper, we describe for the first time, pteridin-7(8H)-one as a scaffold for potent FLT3 inhibitors derived from structural optimizations on irreversible EGFR inhibitors. The representative inhibitor (31) demonstrates single-digit nanomolar inhibition against FLT3 and subnanomolar KD for drug-resistance FLT3 mutants. In profiling of the in vitro tumor cell lines, it shows good selectivity against AML cells harboring FLT3-ITD mutations over other leukemia and solid tumor cell lines. The mechanism of action study illustrates that pteridin-7(8H)-one derivatives suppress the phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream pathways, thereby inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in AML cells. In in vivo studies, 31 significantly suppresses the tumor growth in MV4-11 xenograft model. Overall, we provide a structurally distinct chemical scaffold with which to develop FLT3 mutants-selective inhibitors for AML treatment.","['Sun, Deheng', 'Yang, Yu', 'Lyu, Jiankun', 'Zhou, Wei', 'Song, Wenlin', 'Zhao, Zhenjiang', 'Chen, Zhuo', 'Xu, Yufang', 'Li, Honglin']","['Sun D', 'Yang Y', 'Lyu J', 'Zhou W', 'Song W', 'Zhao Z', 'Chen Z', 'Xu Y', 'Li H']","['State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science & Technology , Shanghai 200237, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science & Technology , Shanghai 200237, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science & Technology , Shanghai 200237, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science & Technology , Shanghai 200237, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science & Technology , Shanghai 200237, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science & Technology , Shanghai 200237, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science & Technology , Shanghai 200237, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science & Technology , Shanghai 200237, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science & Technology , Shanghai 200237, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160622,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pteridines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pteridines/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/06/09 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b00374 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2016 Jul 14;59(13):6187-200. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b00374.

The best studied relationships between Se and the immune system is its role in the functions of neutrophils and of lymphocytes. Despite these observations, it is not yet clear by which mechanism Se is able to modify the immune status. This was a double-blind, crossover study: Group 1 received Se and Group 2 received placebo (30 days). After this, Group 1 received placebo and Group 2 received Se (30 days). Every 30 days, blood samples were collected for white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and Ig level measurement (IgA, IgG, IgE, IgM). Of the 36 patients, 17 were suffering from leukemia/lymphomas (LL) and 19 from solid tumors (ST). In the ST group's leukogram, a significant increase in neutrophils was observed after Se usage (P = .0192). During the analyzed period, Se minimized the triggering of neutropenia cases in both groups. IgA and IgG levels in ST patients were significantly higher than those identified in LL patients after Se usage (P = .0051 and P = .0055). For IgA, a significant increase in its production, after Se usage, was observed in the ST group when compared to the LL (P = .0011). The same did not occur to the IgM and IgE immunoglobulins. In our study, the supplementation with Se reduced the neutropenic cases (LL and ST patients) and reduced IgG and IgA levels in LL and increased in ST group.","['Rocha, Katya Cristina', 'Vieira, Maria Luiza Dos Santos', 'Beltrame, Registila Libania', 'Cartum, Jairo', 'Alves, Sarah Isabel P M do N', 'Azzalis, Ligia Ajaime', 'Junqueira, Virginia Berlanga Campos', 'Pereira, Edimar Cristiano', 'Fonseca, Fernando Luiz Affonso']","['Rocha KC', 'Vieira ML', 'Beltrame RL', 'Cartum J', 'Alves SI', 'Azzalis LA', 'Junqueira VB', 'Pereira EC', 'Fonseca FL']","['1 Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine of ABC, Santo Andre, Sao Paulo, Brazil .', '1 Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine of ABC, Santo Andre, Sao Paulo, Brazil .', '1 Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine of ABC, Santo Andre, Sao Paulo, Brazil .', '1 Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine of ABC, Santo Andre, Sao Paulo, Brazil .', '2 Institute of Environmental Sciences, Chemistry and Pharmacy, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Diadema, Sao Paulo, Brazil .', '2 Institute of Environmental Sciences, Chemistry and Pharmacy, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Diadema, Sao Paulo, Brazil .', '2 Institute of Environmental Sciences, Chemistry and Pharmacy, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Diadema, Sao Paulo, Brazil .', '2 Institute of Environmental Sciences, Chemistry and Pharmacy, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Diadema, Sao Paulo, Brazil .', '1 Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine of ABC, Santo Andre, Sao Paulo, Brazil .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,J Med Food,Journal of medicinal food,9812512,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Dietary Supplements/*analysis', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Selenium/*administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*antioxidant activity', '*ascorbic acid', '*cancer', '*dietary supplementation', '*dietary-induced hyperlipidemia', '*glutathione', '*malondialdehyde', '*selenium']",2016/06/09 06:00,2017/03/11 06:00,['2016/06/09 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jmf.2015.0145 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Food. 2016 Jun;19(6):560-8. doi: 10.1089/jmf.2015.0145.,10.1089/jmf.2015.0145 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a T-cell receptor (TCR)-like monoclonal antibody (8F4) that binds the PR1/HLA-A2 complex on the surface of AML cells, efficiently killing them in vitro and eliminating them in preclinical models. Humanized 8F4 (h8F4) with high affinity for the PR1/HLA-A2 epitope was used to construct an h8F4- chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that was transduced into T cells to mediate anti-leukemia activity. METHODS: Human T cells were transduced to express the PR1/HLA-A2-specific CAR (h8F4-CAR-T cells) containing the scFv of h8F4 fused to the intracellular signaling endo-domain of CD3 zeta chain through the transmembrane and intracellular costimulatory domain of CD28. RESULTS: Adult human normal peripheral blood (PB) T cells were efficiently transduced with the h8F4-CAR construct and predominantly displayed an effector memory phenotype with a minor population (12%) of central memory cells in vitro. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) T cells could also be efficiently transduced with the h8F4-CAR. The PB and UCB-derived h8F4-CAR-T cells specifically recognized the PR1/HLA-A2 complex and were capable of killing leukemia cell lines and primary AML blasts in an HLA-A2-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Human adult PB and UCB-derived T cells expressing a CAR derived from the TCR-like 8F4 antibody rapidly and efficiently kill AML in vitro. Our data could lead to a new treatment paradigm for AML in which targeting leukemia stem cells could transfer long-term immunity to protect against relapse.","['Ma, Qing', 'Garber, Haven R', 'Lu, Sijie', 'He, Hong', 'Tallis, Eran', 'Ding, Xiaoling', 'Sergeeva, Anna', 'Wood, Michael S', 'Dotti, Gianpietro', 'Salvado, Barbara', 'Ruisaard, Kathryn', 'Clise-Dwyer, Karen', 'John, Lisa St', 'Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Alatrash, Gheath', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J']","['Ma Q', 'Garber HR', 'Lu S', 'He H', 'Tallis E', 'Ding X', 'Sergeeva A', 'Wood MS', 'Dotti G', 'Salvado B', 'Ruisaard K', 'Clise-Dwyer K', 'John LS', 'Rezvani K', 'Alatrash G', 'Shpall EJ', 'Molldrem JJ']","['Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Section of Transplantation Immunology, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.

Therefore, use of agents that induce differentiation of leukemic cells in non-APL children appears to be a highly promising therapeutic approach. Based on the experimental studies in mice, we have shown that short-course high-dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) treatment can induce terminal differentiation of leukemic cells in children with various subtypes of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML-M1,-M2,-M3,-M4,-M7). It has also been shown to induce apoptosis of myeloid leukemic cells with or without differentiation. Administration of HDMP as a single agent resulted in a rapid clinical improvement, a marked decrease in blast cells in both peripheral blood and bone marrow and dramatic decreases in the size of extramedullary leukemic mass in children with AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Addition of HDMP to cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens increased the remission rate and improved the outcome in these children.

The situation in developing countries is not well documented. The purpose of this study was characterizing IFD by analyzing data retrospectively to determine the incidence, predisposing factors, diagnostic methods, efficacy of treatment, and the outcome in pediatric patients with hematological disorders. METHODS: There were 160 children with leukemia (22 AML, 129 ALL) and 9 with aplastic anemia (AA). The diagnostic criteria for IFD were defined according to the EORTC/MSG, 2008. IFD was classified as proven or probable. Empiric antifungal treatment with L-AmB was commenced by day 5-7 of persistent fever. Patients with invasive aspergillosis (IA) who were refractory to primary treatment were commenced on voriconazole (VCZ). Salvage therapy as combination of VCZ and caspofungin was given to those with progressive infection. RESULTS: The incidence of IFD was found 23 (14.3%). 19 with leukemia (14 ALL, 5 AML) and 4 with aplastic anemia were diagnosed as IFD. IA was the dominant cause of infection (n=17) and the rest (n: 6) had candidiasis. Ten children had ""proven"" infection and 13 children were defined as ""probable"". The most frequent site of infection was lungs. In our series, the most frequently used diagnostic methods were clinical findings (100%) and radiologic methods (84%). The success rate of treatment for candidiasis and IA were found 60%, 71% respectively. IFD related death rate was found 30%. CONCLUSION: IFD is still a major morbidity and mortality reason in children with hematologic disorders. However, the availability of new antifungal treatments and diagnostic tests will improve the survival rates in these children.","['Baytan, Birol', 'Gunes, Adalet Meral', 'Celebi, Solmaz', 'Gunay, Unsal']","['Baytan B', 'Gunes AM', 'Celebi S', 'Gunay U']","[""Uludag University, Children's Hematology Field 16059 Bursa, Turkey Phone: +90 224 295 04 31 E-mail: baytanbirol@yahoo.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,,,,2009/12/05 00:00,2009/12/05 00:01,['2016/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/05 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2009 Dec 5;26(4):190-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,Hematolojik hastalikli cocuklarda invazif fungal infeksiyonu.,,,,,,,

We have investigated the CXCR4 gene expression during ATRA treatment in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) patients. APL is a characteristic disorder with a specific translocation between PML and RAR alpha genes on chromosome 15 and 17. ATRA-induced differentiation of APL cells is strictly dependent on the presence of PML-RAR alpha. In our study, five APL patiens were involved. Two samples from each patient were compared to each other: Primary diagnostic sample and a sample taken at remission. Quantitative real-time PCR (LightCycler) has been used for quantification, which is a recently developed method for rapid and sensitive detection of gene expression. CXCR4 gene ratios were found under-expressed in cases 1 and 6 with blast counts at diagnosis 18%, and 20% but only moderately under-expressed in cases two and four where the blast count was at diagnosis 50%, and 80%.

In some polycythemia vera (PV) patients, it has inhibited autonomous erythroid colony growth in vitro and decreased the need for phlebotomy. In this study we have investigated the effect of insulin like growth factor (IGF)-I, stem cell factor (SCF) and erythropoietin (Epo) with interleukin (IL)-3, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the presence of imatinib mesylate on the erythroid progenitors derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of three patients with PV and four healthy controls in semisolid medium. Erythroid colony formation from hematopoietic progenitors obtained from healthy controls was observed only in the presence of all cytokines. However, the number of erythroid colonies could not reach that of patients with PV. Inhibition of imatinib mesylate on erythroid colony growth was evident. Hematopoietic progenitors of patients with PV displayed two types of colony formation: the first type was exogenous cytokine-independent and was hypersensitive to current cytokines, and the second displayed hypersensitivity to current exogenous cytokines, but was exogenous cytokine-dependent. For both types, the inhibitory effect of imatinib mesylate was striking in the presence of all cytokines including IL-3, GM-CSF and Epo. There is no direct evidence yet that imatinib mesylate could inhibit the effect of IL-3, G-CSF, GM-CSF, Epo and IGF-I on erythropoiesis. Considering former studies together with results of this study, it can be argued that imatinib mesylate is effective in PV on the intersecting signal transduction mechanisms in which stem cell factor and its receptor may have a part.","['Piskin, Ozden', 'Ozsan, Guner Hayri', 'Ates, Halil', 'Ozcan, Mehmet Ali', 'Demirkan, Fatih', 'Alacacioglu, Inci', 'Undar, Bulent']","['Piskin O', 'Ozsan GH', 'Ates H', 'Ozcan MA', 'Demirkan F', 'Alacacioglu I', 'Undar B']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,,,,2006/09/05 00:00,2006/09/05 00:01,['2016/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2006/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/05 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2006 Sep 5;23(3):136-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,Polisitemia verali hastalarda farkli sitokinler varliginda eritroid koloni gelisimi uzerine imatinib mesylate'in etkisi.,,,,,,,

However, in different anemia groups, different sEpo levels are measured in patients with similar hemoglobin levels and the etiology of this situation could not be explained. METHODS: We evaluated hemoglobin and sEpo levels in 31 iron deficiency anemia, 26 Fanconi anemia (FA), 21 thallasemia intermedia (TI), 15 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients at presentation and 12 healthy controls. RESULTS: In all disease groups, an inverse linear correlation was shown between hemoglobin and logarhytmic sEpo level. The covariance analyses according to corrected hemoglobin levels exhibited the highest sEpo level in FA, followed by ALL, TI and iron deficiency anemia, sequentialy. CONCLUSION: There was no statisticaly significant difference of sEpo levels in FA patients in terms of androgen treatment and this finding supports that androgen affects erythropoisis directly, and has no effect on erythropoietin. The results indicate that there is no erythropoietin deficiency in the anemia of these patients and the admnistration of exogenous erythropoietin offers no clinical benefit.","['Cetin, Mualla', 'Unal, Sule', 'Gumruk, Fatma', 'Gurgey, Aytemiz', 'Altay, Cigdem']","['Cetin M', 'Unal S', 'Gumruk F', 'Gurgey A', 'Altay C']","['Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology, 06100, Sihhiye, Ankara, Turkey, Phone: +90 312 305 11 72 Fax: +90 312 311 23 98 E-mail: mcetin@hacettepe.edu.tr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,,,,2009/06/05 00:00,2009/06/05 00:01,['2016/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/05 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2009 Jun 5;26(2):72-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,Pediatrik hematolojik hastaliklarda serum eritropoetin duzeyleri ve rekombinan insan kaynakli eritropoetin kullaniminin olasi etkileri.,,,,,,,

ATRA, a physiological metabolite of vitamin A (retinol), induces complete clinical remissions (CRs) in about 90% of patients with APL. In contrast to the cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, ATRA can selectively induce terminal differentiation of promyelocytic leukemic cells into normal granulocytes without causing bone marrow hypoplasia or exacerbation of the frequently occurring fatal hemorrhagic syndromes in patients with APL. However, remissions induced by ATRA alone are transient and the patients commonly become resistant to the therapy, leading to relapses in most patients and thus limiting the use of ATRA as a single agent. Therefore, ATRA is currently combined with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, and this regimen dramatically improves patient survival compared to chemotherapy alone, curing about 70% of the patients. However, 30% of APL patients still relapse and die in five years. Recently, arsenic trioxide (As2O3) was proven to be highly effective in inducing CRs not only in APL patients relapsed after ATRA treatment and conventional chemotherapy but also in primary APL patients. Despite the well-documented clinical efficacy of ATRA, molecular mechanisms responsible for development of ATRA resistance are not well understood. Based on in vitro and clinical observations, several mechanisms, including induction of accelerated metabolism of ATRA, decreased bioavailability and plasma drug levels, point mutations in the ATRA-binding domain of promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARalpha) and other molecular events have been proposed to explain ATRA resistance. In this review, the molecular mechanisms of ATRA-induced myeloid cell differentiation and resistance are discussed, together with novel clinical approaches to overcome ATRA resistance in APL.","['Ozpolat, Bulent']",['Ozpolat B'],"['Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Unit 422 1515 Holcombe Blvd. Houston, TX 77030 USA Phone: (713)563-0166 Fax: (713)796-1731 E-mail: bozpolat@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,,,,2009/06/05 00:00,2009/06/05 00:01,['2016/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/05 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2009 Jun 5;26(2):47-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akut promiyelositik losemi ve diferansiyasyon tedavisi: diferansiyasyonun, retinoik asit direncinin ve yeni tedavilerin molekuler mekanizmalari.",,,,,,,

We have investigated the deletion, methylation and p16 protein expression status of MTS1 in Tcell childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (19 cases) and cell lines[11]. On Southern blot homozygous deletions or hemizygous deletion with rearangement were detected in 4/19 T-ALL. The expression of p16 protein was not observed on Western blot in 4/15 T-ALL with intact p16 gene. The p16 gene was methylated 3/15 in T-ALL. Only one of three expressed p16 protein. The other 11/15 T-ALL had p16 protein expression but different level. Loss of MTS1 was observed in 3/11 cell lines. Cell line with MTS1 gene had p16 protein expression in 6/8. After treatment with the demethylating agent (5-AzoCyt) RD cell line showed p16 expression. This has not been observed with the other cell lines. Thus hypermethylation of MTS1 is rare in childhood T-ALL. Although inactivation of MTS1 by deletion is common in T-ALL and cell lines. Furthermore our data show that the p16 gene inactivation by hypermethylation and deletion may play a role in the leukemogenesis.","['Ozkul, Yusuf', 'Jurickova, Ingrid', 'Findley, Harry W W']","['Ozkul Y', 'Jurickova I', 'Findley HW']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,,,,2002/09/05 00:00,2002/09/05 00:01,['2016/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2002/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/05 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2002 Sep 5;19(3):391-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we present the major cytogenetic findings regarding AML and review their clinical significance for achievement of the first complete remission. METHODS: We studied 71 adult patients with de novo AML, without previous myelodysplasia or alkylating therapy. Conventional cytogenetics and FISH were performed on bone marrow cells. The patients with AML were assigned to 12 subgroups according to established data for cytogenetic, molecular and general laboratory results. The selection of the analyzed parameters is consistent with internationally accepted ""prognostic factors"" in adult AML. RESULTS: Complete remission upon induction therapy was achieved in 40% of cases (in a mean period of 2.3 months from therapy initiation). The patients with t(15;17) PML-RARA and inv(16)/CBFbeta-MYH11e demonstrated the highest frequency of complete remission. Patients with hypodiploidy, t(9;22)/bcr-abl and complex karyotypes were therapy-resistant or died within the first three months after AML diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Molecular-cytogenetic findings have an important significance for achievement of first complete remission.

METHODS: Multi-transfused 66 children (59 acute leukemia, 6 thalassemia major, 1 severe hereditary spherocytosis) diagnosed and followed-up between May, 2000 and December, 2006 were evaluated. Screening of all the patients for HbsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, anti-HCV and anti-HIV was performed at presentation and during the last follow-up. Serologic studies of leukemic patients were also repeated at the end of the chemotherapy. Hepatitis B vaccination was administered to unvaccinated patients with anemia. All blood products were provided by Blood Bank of the Center. RESULTS: No patient was found HBsAg, anti-HCV or anti-HIV positive at diagnosis and at the end of the therapy. There was history of hepatitis B vaccination in only 42% of the patients at diagnosis due to administration of this vaccine to newborns since 1998. At the beginning of the study, 45 % (n=27) of the leukemic patients were immune for hepatitis B, but after completion of the intensive chemotherapy seropositivity persisted in only 28.8 % (n=17).

In the present study, we comprehensively investigated the effect of high oxidative stress on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and NO generation in human PMNs. Our findings suggest that PMA or diamide induced oxidative stress in PMNs from healthy volunteers, and high endogenous ROS in PMNs of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients attenuate basal as well as LPS/cytokines induced NO generation and iNOS expression in human PMNs. Mechanistically, we found that under high oxidative stress condition, S-glutathionylation of NFkappaB (p50 and p65 subunits) severely limits iNOS expression due to its reduced binding to iNOS promoter, which was reversed in presence of DTT. Furthermore, by using pharmacological inhibitors, scavengers and molecular approaches, we identified that enhanced ROS generation via NOX2 and mitochondria, reduced Grx1/2 expression and GSH level associated with NFkappaB S-glutathionylation in PMNs from CML patients. Altogether data obtained suggest that oxidative status act as an important regulator of NO generation/iNOS expression, and under enhanced oxidative stress condition, NOX2-mtROS-NFkappaB S-glutathionylation is a feed forward loop, which attenuate NO generation and iNOS expression in human PMNs.","['Singh, Abhishek Kumar', 'Awasthi, Deepika', 'Dubey, Megha', 'Nagarkoti, Sheela', 'Kumar, Ashutosh', 'Chandra, Tulika', 'Barthwal, Manoj Kumar', 'Tripathi, Anil Kumar', 'Dikshit, Madhu']","['Singh AK', 'Awasthi D', 'Dubey M', 'Nagarkoti S', 'Kumar A', 'Chandra T', 'Barthwal MK', 'Tripathi AK', 'Dikshit M']","['Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India.', 'Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India.', 'Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India.', 'Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India.', ""Department of Pathology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India."", ""Department of Transfusion Medicine, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India."", 'Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India.', ""Department of Clinical Haematology & Medical Oncology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, India."", 'Pharmacology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India.

Sixteen patients including 14 ALL and 2 AML entered the study. Four were females and 12 were males with the mean age of 17.38 +/- 3.81 years. Following the completion of their therapy, the mean follow up period of the patients was 62.43 +/- 41.11 months. Somatic growth, sexual maturation, hypothalamic- pituitary-thyroid axis and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis were evaluated in all the patients. Two out of 16 had pathologic short stature (12.5%) and 3 patients had enuchoid status (18.75%) with antrophometric measurements. Eleven patients had normal thyroid gland dimensions and homogeneous thyroid tissue on ultrasonographic examination. One patient had Ia and another four patients had Ib diffuse goitre according to WHO criteria. Two out of 16 patients were diagnosed as subclinic primary hypothyroidism (12.5%), and three of them were diagnosed as subclinic central hypothyroidism (18.75%) according to TRH testing. Three patients were subclinic subtle central hypothyroidism. Thyroid auto-antibodies were in normal range in all patients. Eight patients (66.6%) out of 12 male subjects revealed impaired HHG axis. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (Leydig and Sertoli dysfunction) were observed in five of them and isolated Sertoli dysfunction was detected in three of them. Azoospermia was encountered in all patients with isolated Sertoli dysfunction. Testicular biopsy was obtained from only one of them and atrophic testicular tissue was detected. Female patients show normal pubertal development and gonadal functions. CONCLUSION: Subclinic subtle primary and subclinic central hypothyroidism were found in 31.2%, impaired Sertoli and Leydig with Sertoli cell function in 66.66% of long-term survivors pediatric acute leukemia and testicular tissue was more sensitive to adverse effects of chemotherapy than ovarian tissue.","['Gozdasoglu, Sevgi', 'Aksoylar, Serap', 'Berberoglu, Merih', 'Ocal, Gonul', 'Adiyaman, Pelin', 'Cavdar, Ayhan O', 'Babacan, Emel', 'Unal, Emel', 'Tacyildiz, Nurdan', 'Yavuz, Gulsan']","['Gozdasoglu S', 'Aksoylar S', 'Berberoglu M', 'Ocal G', 'Adiyaman P', 'Cavdar AO', 'Babacan E', 'Unal E', 'Tacyildiz N', 'Yavuz G']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,,,,2002/06/05 00:00,2002/06/05 00:01,['2016/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2002/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/05 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2002 Jun 5;19(2):293-301.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Break-point fusion regions of leukaemia related chromosomal aberrations and rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell-receptor (TCR) genes, which can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are used as leukaemia specific markers in genetic studies of MRD. A total of 31 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed ALL were screened for eligibility criteria. Of those 26 were included in the study. One patient with partial response following induction therapy and four patients who were lost to follow-up after induction were excluded from the study; thus 21 patients were evaluated for MRD. Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 5 (24%) of the patients and were used for MRD monitoring. Three patients had t(9;22) translocation, the other 2 had t(4;11) and t(1;19). MRD-based risk stratification of the 16 patients analysed for Ig/TCR rearrangements revealed 3 low-risk, 11 intermediate-risk and 2 high-risk patients.

Recent studies discovered the presence of overactive TrkA signaling due to TrkA rearrangements or TrkA fusion products in frequent cancers like colorectal cancer, thyroid cancer, or acute myeloid leukemia. Thus, targeting TrkA/NGF via selective small-molecule-inhibitors or antibodies has gained enormous attention in the drug discovery sector. Clinical studies on the anti-cancer impact of NGF-blocking antibodies are likely to be accelerated after the recent removal of clinical holds on these agents by regulatory authorities. Based on these current developments, the present review provides not only a broad overview of the biological effects of NGF-TrkA-p75NTR on cancer cells and their microenvironment, but also explains why NGF and its receptors are going to evoke major interest as promising therapeutic anti-cancer targets in the coming decade.","['Demir, Ihsan Ekin', 'Tieftrunk, Elke', 'Schorn, Stephan', 'Friess, Helmut', 'Ceyhan, Guralp O']","['Demir IE', 'Tieftrunk E', 'Schorn S', 'Friess H', 'Ceyhan GO']","['Department of Surgery, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, 81675 Munich, Germany.

Most (83.3%) experienced 2 or more late effects, and more than half of the patients (64.7%) experienced 3 or more late effects. The most commonly observed late effects included dental problems (92.2%), short stature (55.9%), cognitive deficits (53.6%), pulmonary dysfunction (18.6%), and abnormal pubertal development (27.9%). This is the first report of late effects of Bu-based conditioning in a cohort of very young patients at the time of transplant. These results will inform clinical care guidelines for long-term follow-up and add to the growing information regarding outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Allewelt, Heather', 'El-Khorazaty, Jill', 'Mendizabal, Adam', 'Taskindoust, Mahsa', 'Martin, Paul L', 'Prasad, Vinod', 'Page, Kristin', 'Sanders, Jean', 'Kurtzberg, Joanne']","['Allewelt H', 'El-Khorazaty J', 'Mendizabal A', 'Taskindoust M', 'Martin PL', 'Prasad V', 'Page K', 'Sanders J', 'Kurtzberg J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.

Variant Ph translocations are observed in 5%-10% of CML patients. In variant translocations 3 and possibly more chromosomes are involved. Herein we report 6 CML patients with variant Ph translocations. METHODS: Bone marrow samples were examined using conventional cytogenetic meth ods. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole-chromosome paints and BCR-ABL 1D probes were used to confirm and/or complement the findings, and identify rearrangements beyond the resolution of conventional cytogenetic methods. RESULTS: Variant Ph translocations in the 6 patients were as follows: t(7;22)(p22;q11), t(9;22;15)(q34;q11;q22), t(15;22)(p11;q11), t(1;9;22;3)(q24;q34;q11;q21), t(12;22)(p13;q11), and t(4;8;9;22)(q11;q13;q34;q11).

Number of studies reported that some patients with variant Ph translocation were poor responders to imatinib.

We examined the importance of molecular-cytogenetic abnormalities for complete remission (CR) rates and the overall survival (OS) in adult ALLs. METHODS: Conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed on bone marrow cells from 33 newly-diagnosed ALL adults. Two karyotype categories [standard- risk group- normal karyotype, hyperdiplody and other structural aberrations, and high-risk group-t(11q23)/MLL, t(9;22)/bcr-abl, t(1;19), t(8;14), C-MYC and complex karyotype] and the biologically and clinically relevant ALL ploidy subgroups were prospectively defined. RESULTS: Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 52% of the cases with a high rate of poor-risk translocations - t(9;22), t(8q24), t(11q23), t(1;19). The total CR rate was 67% and the median time for achievement 2.33 months. Male sex, an age below 35 years and the absence of high risk translocations might have contributed to the high CR rates. Female patients, hyperdiplody, low white blood cells (WBC), and random cytogenetic aberrations had the longest OS. OS, 3- and 5-years survival periods were significantly shorter for poor-risk than standard risk group (p=.015, p=.001 and p=.005, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the lack of influence of cytogenetic aberrations on the CR and the time to achieve CR. However, our observations show that these aberrations are an independent prognostic factor in adult ALL - they allow predicting therapy resistance and the OS time after intense treatment.","['Velizarova, Milena Georgieva', 'Hadjiev, Evgueniy A', 'Alexandrova, Kamelia V', 'Dimova, Ivanka I', 'Toncheva, Draga I', 'Dimitrova, Nadya E']","['Velizarova MG', 'Hadjiev EA', 'Alexandrova KV', 'Dimova II', 'Toncheva DI', 'Dimitrova NE']","['1 G.

The prognostic values of BCL2L1 and MCL1 copy-number variations (CNVs) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain largely unknown. Somatic CNVs in BCL2L1 and MCL1 genes were tested in tumor tissues from 516 NSCLC patients in southern China; afterward, survival analyses were conducted with overall survival (OS) as outcome. Additionally, the associations between CNVs and mRNA expression levels were explored using data from 986 NSCLC patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas project. It was found that amplifications of BCL2L1 and MCL1 were associated with unfavorable OS of NSCLC, with adjusted hazards ratio of 1.62 (95% confident interval [CI] = 1.10-2.40; P = 0.015) and 1.39 (95% CI = 1.05-1.84; P = 0.020), respectively. Amplifications of MCL1, but not BCL2L1, were related with higher mRNA expression levels of corresponding gene, compared with non-amplifications (P = 0.005). Interestingly, after incorporating with MCL1 CNV status, clinical variables (age, sex, TNM stage, and surgical approach) showed an improved discriminatory ability to classify OS (area under curve increased from 72.2% to 74.1%; P = 0.042, DeLong's test). Overall, MCL1 CNV might be a prognostic biomarker for NSCLC, and additional investigations are needed to validate our findings.","['Yin, Jieyun', 'Li, Yangkai', 'Zhao, Hao', 'Qin, Qin', 'Li, Xiaorong', 'Huang, Jiao', 'Shi, Yun', 'Gong, Shufang', 'Liu, Li', 'Fu, Xiangning', 'Nie, Shaofa', 'Wei, Sheng']","['Yin J', 'Li Y', 'Zhao H', 'Qin Q', 'Li X', 'Huang J', 'Shi Y', 'Gong S', 'Liu L', 'Fu X', 'Nie S', 'Wei S']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and MOE Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Medical College of Soochow University, 199 Ren-ai Road Industrial Park District, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Social Science and Public Health, School of Basic Medical Science, Jiujiang University, No. 17, Lufeng Road, Jiujiang, 332000, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and MOE Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and MOE Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and MOE Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and MOE Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and MOE Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tongji Medical College, Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and MOE Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and MOE Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. ws2008cn@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160605,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'China', 'Computational Biology/methods', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCL2L1', '*MCL1', '*copy-number variation', '*non-small-cell lung cancer', '*prognosis']",2016/06/07 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cam4.774 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2016 Sep;5(9):2171-9. doi: 10.1002/cam4.774.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the role activated protein C resistance in the hypercoagulable state seen in polycythemia vera. We compared patients with polycythemia vera (n: 24) for increased risk of thromboembolism and activated protein C resistance, with the results of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (n: 27) and healthy control group (n: 52).

Interestingly, we observe that type I IFN is not elicited in animals with disseminated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Further, survival of leukemia-bearing animals is not diminished in the absence of type I IFN signaling, suggesting that STING may not be triggered by AML. However, the STING agonist, DMXAA, induces expression of IFN-beta and other inflammatory cytokines, promotes dendritic cell (DC) maturation, and results in the striking expansion of leukemia-specific T cells. Systemic DMXAA administration significantly extends survival in two AML models. The therapeutic effect of DMXAA is only partially dependent on host type I IFN signaling, suggesting that other cytokines are important. A synthetic cyclic dinucleotide that also activates human STING provided a similar anti-leukemic effect. These data demonstrate that STING is a promising immunotherapeutic target in AML.","['Curran, Emily', 'Chen, Xiufen', 'Corrales, Leticia', 'Kline, Douglas E', 'Dubensky, Thomas W Jr', 'Duttagupta, Priyanka', 'Kortylewski, Marcin', 'Kline, Justin']","['Curran E', 'Chen X', 'Corrales L', 'Kline DE', 'Dubensky TW Jr', 'Duttagupta P', 'Kortylewski M', 'Kline J']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA; Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.', 'Aduro Biotech, Inc., Berkeley, CA 94710, USA.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Immuno-Oncology, Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA; Committee on Immunology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.

Increased hTERC gene expression has been frequently observed and amplification was shown using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in different cancers. The aim of this study was to determine whether hTERC gene amplification is detectable by FISH in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. METHODS: FISH and karyotype results at the time of diagnosis of 23 adult AML patients were retrospectively evaluated. Additionally, fixed cells were hybridized with an hTERC region-specific FISH probe to determine gene amplification. RESULTS: Ten of the 23 patients had a normal karyotype and 6 had an abnormal karyotype. hTERC region amplification was not observed in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: Although it was reported that hTERC gene amplification may partially contribute to increased telomerase expression and activity in leukemic cells, it is not possible to make such a conclusion based on the results of the this study, as hTERC amplification was not observed in the study group. This suggests that increased telomerase activity via gene amplification in the development of AML may not be as important a factor as it is in solid tumors.","['Ozer, Ozge', 'Bulakbasi Balci, Tugce', 'Yilmaz, Zerrin', 'Sahin, Feride Iffet']","['Ozer O', 'Bulakbasi Balci T', 'Yilmaz Z', 'Sahin FI']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Baskent University, Kubilay Sok.

The optimal time for prosthesis placement is still unclear, and its complication rate has been poorly studied in children. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors of complications in cases of testicular prosthesis implantation in children. STUDY DESIGN: A monocentric, retrospective review was performed of children implanted with a testicular prosthesis between 2008 and 2014. All implantations were performed through an inguinal incision with a standardized procedure. Children were divided into two groups depending on the interval after orchiectomy: (A) early implantation (delay between surgeries <1 year); and (B) delayed surgeries (delay >/=1 year). Statistical analysis was performed with Student and Fisher tests. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (A, 15; B, 11) had a total of 38 testicular prostheses placements. Mean follow-up was 36.2 months. First surgery was performed at the mean age of 11.8 years (range 0-17.9) (A, 14.1; B, 8.1; P = 0.01) and testicular prosthesis implantation at the mean age of 14.7 years (range 9-18) (A, 14.3; B, 14.6) with a mean delay of 36.1 months (A, 1.3; B, 80.3). Indications were mainly spermatic cord torsion (27%), bilateral anorchia (27%), and testicular atrophy after cryptorchidism surgery (19.2%). Complications (10.5%) included two cases of extrusion, one infection and one migration. Patient 1 had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with testicle relapse 2 years after induction therapy. High-dose chemotherapy, total body irradiation and bilateral orchiectomies were performed, and bilateral prostheses were implanted 12 years after the end of chemotherapy. Complications happened 85 days after surgery. Patient 2 was followed-up for a proximal hypospadias. The tunica vaginalis flap, which was used during a redo urethroplasty, lead to testicular atrophy. Thirteen years after the last penile surgery, a testicular prosthesis was placed through an inguinal incision, and extrusion occurred 203 days after surgery. Bacterial cultures of the prostheses were sterile and histological review showed no sign of granuloma or graft rejection. The complication rate was significantly higher if the delay between the two surgeries exceeded 1 year (P = 0.01). Indications of orchiectomy, prior scrotal incision, and prosthesis size were not risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Testicular prosthesis implantation was relatively safe in a pediatric cohort.

We examined reasons for their hospital admissions and identified potentially avoidable hospital admissions (PAH) in this age group in the USA. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we examined the reasons for hospital admissions in older patients diagnosed with and treated for acute myeloid leukaemia at two tertiary care hospitals in the USA. We included patients receiving intensive induction chemotherapy or non-intensive treatment. We excluded those with acute promyelocytic leukaemia, those seen only for a one-time consultation who received primary treatment elsewhere, and those who received supportive care alone. We identified the eligible cohort using the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital Leukemia Clinical Research Information Systems database. Practising oncologists used a consensus-driven medical record review process to identify the primary reason for each hospital admission and categorise it as potentially avoidable or not avoidable on the basis of an adaptation of Graham's criteria for PAH. We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify predictors of PAH. FINDINGS: Between May 1, 2005, and Dec 23, 2011, we assessed 1040 hospital admissions (excluding initial admission for diagnosis) in 329 consecutively admitted patients. The most common primary reasons for hospital admissions were: fever or infection (396 [38%]), planned admission for chemotherapy or transplantation (391 [38%]), and uncontrolled symptoms (102 [10%]). We identified 172 (27%) of 649 unplanned hospital admissions as potentially avoidable; among these admissions, 82 (48%) were readmissions because of previous premature hospital discharge, 32 (19%) because of problems that could have been managed in the outpatient setting, and 26 (15%) because of failure of timely outpatient follow-up. In a mixed logistic regression model, higher education (odds ratio 1.43 [95% CI 1.01-2.00]; p=0.04) and receipt of non-intensive induction chemotherapy (1.97 [1.25-3.10]; p=0.003) were predictors of PAH. INTERPRETATION: Although many hospital admissions in older patients with acute myeloid leukaemia are unavoidable and driven by the illness course and its treatment, a substantial proportion are potentially avoidable. Future interventions to reduce PAH in this population are clearly warranted.

Neoplastic cells express CD4, CD43 (also termed SPN), CD45RA and CD56 (also termed NCAM1), as well as the plasmacytoid dendritic cell-associated antigens CD123 (also termed IL3RA), BDCA-2 (also termed CD303, CLEC4E) TCL1 and CTLA1 (also termed GZMB). The median survival is only a few months as the tumour exhibits a progressive course despite initial response to chemotherapy. The best modality of treatment remains to be defined. Generally, patients receive acute leukaemia-like induction, according to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)-type or acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL)-type regimens. The frequent neuromeningeal involvement indicates systematic pre-emptive intrathecal chemotherapy in addition to intensive chemotherapy. Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), particularly when performed in first remission, may improve the survival. Preliminary data suggest a potential role for immunomodulatory agents and novel targeted drugs. Herein epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management of BPDCN will be presented. In detail, this review focuses on the therapeutic aspects of BPDCN, proposing a treatment algorithm for the management of the disease, including induction chemotherapy, allogeneic HSCT and intrathecal prophylaxis at different steps of treatment, according to compliance, biological and clinical characteristics of patients.","['Pagano, Livio', 'Valentini, Caterina G', 'Grammatico, Sara', 'Pulsoni, Alessandro']","['Pagano L', 'Valentini CG', 'Grammatico S', 'Pulsoni A']","['Institute of Haematology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Haematology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, ""Sapienza University"", Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Haematology, ""Sapienza University"", Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160605,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dendritic Cells/*pathology', 'Disease Management', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute leukaemia', '*blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm', '*chemotherapy', '*haematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*intrathecal prophylaxis']",2016/06/07 06:00,2017/05/17 06:00,['2016/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.14146 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Jul;174(2):188-202. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14146.

METHODS: This retrospective study included data from 327 patients (113 NHL and 214 ALL). RESULTS: Hyperuricemia occurred in 26.5% and 12.6% of the patients with NHL and ALL, respectively. The corresponding figures for TLS were 15.9% and 0.47% (p=0.001). All hyperuricemic NHL patients had advanced disease and renal involvement was present in 53%. All hyperuricemic ALL patients had a leukocyte count >50,000 mm3 at the time of diagnosis. Among the hyperuricemic NHL and ALL patients, 96.6% and 66.6% had LDH >/=500 UI/L, respectively. Treatment consisted of hydration and allopurinol; none of the patients received urate oxidase. Among the patients that developed TLS, 26.3% had laboratory TLS, 42.1% had grade I or II TLS, and 31.6% had grade III or IV TLS. Uric acid levels returned to normal after a mean period of 3.5+/-2.5 and 3.05+/-0.8 d in NHL and ALL groups, respectively. In all, 7% of the patients with hyperuricemia required hemodialysis. None of the patients died. CONCLUSION: In this series the factors associated with a high-risk for TLS were renal involvement in NHL and high leucocyte count in ALL.

Our aim was to investigate possible relationships between t(12,21) existence and expression changes of these two genes (FLI1, CXCR4) in ALL. Thirty-one ALL patients were investigated. Twenty-one of these patients were t(12,21) carriers. We used the Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR. Obtained results were compared to normal bone marrow samples of five healthy subjects. Expression differences were not found significant in both groups. Our study was the first attempt to quantify these genes in t(12,21) patients.

The system involving angiopoietin-2 [Ang-2] and its receptor Tie-2 appears to play an important role in tumor angiogenesis and in the biology of hematological and non-hematological malignancies. We evaluated the levels of soluble (s)Ang-2 and sTie-2 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and investigated the impact of their circulating levels on the overall survival in those patients. METHODS: Ang-2 and Tie-2 were measured in plasma samples from AML patients and controls using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The levels of sAng-2 and sTie-2 were significantly higher in AML patients (2382.1+/-1586.1 pg/ml and 6.74+/-3.47 ng/ml, respectively) than in controls (649.5+/-402.6 pg/ml and 2.63+/-0.57 ng/ml, respectively; p<0.01). AML patients with high levels of sAng-2 and sTie-2 (>/=2500 pg/ml and >/=8 ng/ml, respectively) had significantly shorter overall survival than those patients with low levels (<2500 pg/ml and <8 ng/ml, respectively). CONCLUSION: The results of our study demonstrated the prognostic significance of circulating sAng-2 and sTie-2 in AML patients.

METHODS: Lymphoblasts were incubated in different heparin concentrations (0, 10, 20 U/ml), and the percentages of lymphoblasts in each phase of the cell cycle were simultaneously measured by flow cytometry at 0, 1, and 2 hours (h). RESULTS: The percentages of lymphoblasts at the G2/M and S phases were significantly increased in 20 U/ml heparin concentration at 1 h compared to 0 U/ml (without heparin) concentration. We demonstrated that heparin increases the percentages of lymphoblasts in the S and G2/M phases in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: It was shown that heparin expands the proliferation of lymphoblasts by increasing the transition to G2/M and S phases and the S-phase fraction ratio.

Conventional treatment modalities or second transplants have not provided the sustained complete remissions on the whole. Reinfusion and activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes of the donor seem to be effective and it has been understood that the success of the transplantation depends mainly on graft versus leukemia effect. Thirteen patients with leukemia (8 CML, 5 AML) who had relapsed after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with myeloablative conditioning, have received donor leukocyte infusions (DLI). The median time between transplantation and relapse was 18 months (4-57 months). For CML patients who had cytogenetic or hematologic relapse, IFN alpha 2b was started at a dose of 5 million units/m2/d for every consecutive days. Starting from the fifth week of this treatment, unprimed donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells were infused to the patients once a week for four weeks. IFN treatment was not cessated during these infusions, and was given for 12 weeks totally. For relapsed acute leukemia patients, standart chemotherapy regimens as for AML were used. After the treatment, donor lymphocytes which were obtained from the original HCT donor who was primed with G-CSF were given. After recovery, IFN alfa2b was started 5 million U/m2/d each consecutive day until the GVHD findings were observed. GVHD prophylaxis was not made after DLIs. Acute GVHD was seen in 11 of 13 patients. Four patients developed chronicGVHD. Among 13 patients, four patients are alive and they have been in complete remission for 23 to 76 months. The other patients were not alive due to mostly disease progression. Two patients died because of advanced GVHD. In our practice, the patients with progressive disease were not the well responded ones. These observations suggest that there is a limit for the immune effect regarding the number of the tumor cells and their proliferative capacity. Chemotherapy, which does not suppress immunity, may give time and chance to allogeneic lymphocytes to affect.","['Gurman, G']",['Gurman G'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,,,,2000/12/05 00:00,2000/12/05 00:01,['2016/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2000/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/12/05 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2000 Dec 5;17(4):171-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunologic detection of drug efflux pumps such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistance associated protein 1 (MRP1) rrelate with functional assays of drug resistance and these drug accumulation defects also appear operable in ALL. Other markers such as LRP, bcl- 2, and BRCP, have been described in patients with AML although their pathophysiology and clinical relevance is less clear and methodology for their quantification not well standardized. Preclinical tudies have shown that small molecules capable of reversing efflux can restore drug sensitivity in resistant tumor models. While initial clinical studies were limited by both potency and specificity of the reverser, later studies with more effective reversers have in many instances been limited by pharmacokinetic interactions exacerbating the clinical toxicities of chemotherapy. Nonetheless, one large randomized study using cyclosporine has demonstrated a proven survival advantage without increased toxicity, although the inconsistent results with other modulators raises doubt as to the utility and overall strategy of using drug efflux blockers in patients with established Pgp overexpression. Most of these patients have additional mechanisms of resistance and achieving meaningful clinical responses will likely require more complex clinical strategies. Preventing or delaying development of drug resistance in chemosensitive patientsrepresents another therapeutic strategy to be tested.","['Chauncey, T R']",['Chauncey TR'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,,,,2000/12/05 00:00,2000/12/05 00:01,['2016/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2000/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/12/05 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2000 Dec 5;17(4):155-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Suggested causes in our patients were chemotherapeutics, hypertension, infection and antimicrobial drug administration, tumor lysis syndrome, acute renal failure and hemodialysis, immunosuppressive drug administration, and hypomagnesemia. One of the patients died of sepsis, renal failure and pulmonary hemorrhage and another died of relapse after total recovery from PRES. The other four patients are under follow-up without problems. CONCLUSION: We suggest that PRES can recover fully with early diagnosis and treatment whereas it can show poor prognosis depending on the etiology.","['Malbora, Baris', 'Avci, Zekai', 'Donmez, Fulden', 'Alioglu, Bulent', 'Baskin, Esra', 'Alehan, Fusun', 'Ozbek, Namik']","['Malbora B', 'Avci Z', 'Donmez F', 'Alioglu B', 'Baskin E', 'Alehan F', 'Ozbek N']","['Baskent University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology 6.

In animal models, it has been shown that complete CTLA-4 deficiency was lethal due to massive infiltration of tissues by polyclonally proliferating lymphocytes. CTLA-4 A49G polymorphism, which has been suggested to reduce the inhibitory function of the CTLA-4 molecule, was found to be associated with various autoimmune diseases in recent studies. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the frequency of CTLA-4 A49G polymorphism in 46 patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), 62 patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and 150 healthy individuals. RESULTS: Allele frequencies and genotype distributions were similar in both ITP and AIHA patients compared to healthy individuals. In subgroup analysis, however, we found that in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with AIHA (n=4), all patients had CTLA-4 A49G polymorphism (3 had AG, 1 had GG). There was no significant statistical association between G allele and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or AIHA. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that CTLA-4 A49G polymorphism does not contribute to the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative diseases itself, nor does it increase the risk of autoimmune complications in patients with lymphoproliferative disease.","['Akturk, Faruk', 'Hancer, Veysel Sabri', 'Kucukkaya, Reyhan']","['Akturk F', 'Hancer VS', 'Kucukkaya R']","['Istanbul Bilim University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Esentepe, Istanbul, Turkey Phone: +90 533 634 30 14 E-mail: vshancer@istanbul.edu.tr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,,,,,,2010/06/05 00:00,2010/06/05 00:01,['2016/06/07 06:00'],"['2016/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/05 00:01 [medline]']",['10.5152/tjh.2010.04 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2010 Jun 5;27(2):78-81. doi: 10.5152/tjh.2010.04.,10.5152/tjh.2010.04 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,Sitotoksik T lenfosit antijen-4 (CTLA-4) A49G polimorfizmi ve otoimmun kan hastaliklari.,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to screen HHT-producing endophytic fungi from Cephalotaxus hainanensis Li. By screening 213 fungal isolates obtained from the bark parts of Cephalotaxus hainanensis Li, one isolate was found to be capable of biosynthesizing HHT. The fungus was identified as Alternaria tenuissima by morphological characteristics and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis and was named as CH1307. HHT obtained from CH1307 was analyzed through the HPLC and LC-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. The extract of the fermentation broth of CH1307 showed antiproliferative activities against K562 (chronic myelocytic leukemia), NB4 (acute promyelocytic leukemia), and HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia) human cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 67.25 +/- 4.26, 65.02 +/- 4.75, and 99.23 +/- 4.26 mug/mL, respectively.

METHODS: This analysis was based on patients diagnosed with BCC in Lithuania between 1998 and 2007 and followed until 2011. Standardized incidence ratios for subsequent cancers as a ratio of observed number of cancer cases in people with previous BCC diagnosis to the expected number of cancer cases in the underlying general population were calculated. RESULTS: After diagnosis of BCC, 1442 new cases of selected cancers were diagnosed. Compared with the general population, the incidence of all new primaries combined after BCC was very close to expected. Statistically meaningful increase in developing subsequent cancer was obtained for Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, and leukemia in men, and for cancers of the lip, lung, and breast in women. Risk of melanoma and thyroid cancer was significantly elevated in both sexes. Relative risk of cancer of the eye was increased although not significant.

Resistance to therapeutic drugs is considered as a major clinical concern resulting in a weaker response to chemotherapy, disease relapse and decreased survival rate. Survivin, a member of Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs), is associated with drug resistance and inhibition of apoptotic mechanisms in numerous hematological malignancies. In the present study, we examined the combined effect of etoposide and siRNA-mediated silencing of survivin on U-937 acute myeloid leukemia cells. The AML cells were transfected with survivin specific siRNA and gene knockdown was confirmed by quantitative real time PCR and western blotting. Subsequently, U-937 cells were assessed for response to etoposide treatment and apoptosis rate was measured with flowcytometery. The cytotoxic effects in siRNA-etoposide group were measured and compared to etoposide single therapy group. Survivin siRNA effectively knocked down the mRNA and protein levels of survivin, which led to lower cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis. Furthermore, combined treatment of etoposide and survivin siRNA synergistically increased the cell toxic effects of etoposide and its ability to induce apoptosis.","['Jafarlou, M', 'Baradaran, B', 'Shanehbandi, D', 'Saedi, T A', 'Jafarlou, V', 'Ismail, P', 'Othman, F']","['Jafarlou M', 'Baradaran B', 'Shanehbandi D', 'Saedi TA', 'Jafarlou V', 'Ismail P', 'Othman F']","['Universiti Putra Malaysia Department of Human Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences Selangor Malaysia.', 'Tabriz University of Medical Sciences Immunology Research center Tabriz Iran.', 'Tabriz University of Medical Sciences Immunology Research center Tabriz Iran.', 'Universiti Putra Malaysia Institute of Biosciences Selangor Malaysia.', 'Tabriz University of Medical Sciences Department of Surgery, Imam Reza hospital Tabriz Iran.', 'Universiti Putra Malaysia Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences Selangor Malaysia.', 'Universiti Putra Malaysia Department of Human Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences Selangor Malaysia Fauziah@upm.edu.my.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160530,France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Survivin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Etoposide/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*metabolism', 'Survivin', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",,,2016/06/06 06:00,2017/01/24 06:00,['2016/06/06 06:00'],"['2015/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 2016 May 30;62(6):44-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, prior to any treatment change, the potential benefits and risks of each TKI and the goals of the patient must be considered. Here we review current NCCN and ELN response recommendations for patients with CML, highlight the impact of early responses on long-term prognosis, and discuss several reasons patients may consider a switch in TKI therapy.

Plant-derived secondary metabolites are shown to have positive role in various diseases and conditions. The aim of the present study is to summarize clinical evidences on the benefits of phytochemicals as adjuvant therapy along with conventional anticancer therapies. METHODS: Electronic databases including Pubmed, Scopus and Cochrane library were searched with the keywords ""chemotherapeutic"", ""anticancer"", ""antineoplastic"" or ""radiotherapy"" with ""plant"", ""extract"", ""herb"", or ""phytochemical"", until July 2015. Only clinical studies were included in this review. RESULTS: The findings showed that positive effects of phytochemicals are due to their direct anticarcinogenic activity, induction of relief in cancer complications, as well as their protective role against side effects of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Results obtained from current review demonstrated that numerous phytochemical agents from different chemical categories including alkaloid, benzopyran, coumarin, carotenoid, diarylheptanoid, flavonoid, indole, polysaccharide, protein, stilbene, terpene, and xanthonoid possess therapeutic effect in patients with different types of cancer. Polyphenols are the most studied components. Curcumin, ginsenosides, lycopene, homoharringtonine, aviscumine, and resveratrol are amongst the major components with remarkable volumes of clinical evidence indicating their direct anticancer activities in different types of cancer including hepatocarcinoma, prostate cancer, leukemia and lymphoma, breast and ovarian cancer, and gastrointestinal cancers. Cannabinoids, cumarin, curcumin, ginsenosides, epigallocatechin gallate, vitexin, and salidroside are phytochemicals with significant alleviative effect on synthetic chemotherapy- induced toxicities. CONCLUSION: There is lack of evidence from clinical trials in case of a large number of phytochemicals and further human studies are recommended to confirm the role of plant metabolites in the management of cancer.","['Farzaei, Mohammad Hosein', 'Bahramsoltani, Roodabeh', 'Rahimi, Roja']","['Farzaei MH', 'Bahramsoltani R', 'Rahimi R']","['Department of Traditional Pharmacy, School of Traditional Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. rahimi_r@tums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Phytochemicals)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Phytochemicals/chemistry/*therapeutic use']",,,2016/06/06 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2016/06/06 06:00'],"['2016/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['CPD-EPUB-76111 [pii]', '10.2174/1381612822666160601100823 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2016;22(27):4201-18. doi: 10.2174/1381612822666160601100823.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the antihyperlipidemic effect, antioxidant potential and cytotoxicity of aqueous and methanolic extracts of ripe and unripe fruits, leaves and stem of A. carambola. METHODS: Antihyperlipidemic activity was assessed in poloxamer-407 (P-407) induced acute hyperlipidemic rat's model. The antioxidant activity was assessed in vitro using 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging, 1-diphenyl-2-dipicrylhydrazyl radical scavenging (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. In addition, cytotoxicity of A. carambola extracts was assessed using MTS assay on four leukemic cell lines (human colon cancer, human promyeloid leukemia, erythroid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia) and one normal cell (human umbilical vein endothelial cells). RESULTS: Methanolic extract of leaves had the most potent antihyperlipidemic activity in P-407 model, whereby it significantly reduced serum levels of total cholesterol (P<0.01), triglycerides (P<0.01), low-density lipoprotein (P<0.05), verylow- density lipoprotein (P<0.01) and atherogenic index (P<0.01). On the other hand, methanolic extracts of A. carambola stem and leaves showed the strongest antioxidant activity. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents of the extracts exhibited significant correlations with antioxidant but not with antihyperlipidemic activities. All plant parts showed no cytotoxic effect on the selected cancer or normal cell lines. CONCLUSION: Antihyperlipidemic activity of different parts of A. carambola is greatly affected by extraction solvents used. Methanolic extract of A. carambola leaves exhibited higher antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant potentials compared to other parts of the plant.","['Saghir, Sultan A M', 'Sadikun, Amirin', 'Al-Suede, Fouad S R', 'Majid, Amin M S A', 'Murugaiyah, Vikneswaran']","['Saghir SA', 'Sadikun A', 'Al-Suede FS', 'Majid AM', 'Murugaiyah V']","['Discipline of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia. vicky@usm.my.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Hypolipidemic Agents)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '106392-12-5 (Poloxamer)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', '*Averrhoa', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Fruit', 'Hypolipidemic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Lipoproteins, LDL', 'Male', 'Medicine, Traditional', 'Phenols/pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves', 'Poloxamer/chemistry', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",,,2016/06/06 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/06/06 06:00'],"['2016/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['CPB-EPUB-76205 [pii]', '10.2174/1389201017666160603013434 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2016;17(10):915-25. doi: 10.2174/1389201017666160603013434.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A seashell protein Haishengsu (HSS) has been found to exert anticancer activities in recent in vitro studies. The aim of this study was to determine whether the addition of HSS to the conventional chemotherapies would increase chemosensitivity and improves quality of life in patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-eight patients with acute leukemia were enrolled in a double-blind, and placebo-controlled study. In addition to conventional chemotherapy, 142 patients received HSS and 106 received placebo. In an in vitro study, the expression of P-gp was evaluated by flow cytometry in a drug-resistant leukemia cell line (K562/ADM cells). Sorcin was examined by Western blot. RESULTS: The complete remission rates in the HSS treatment group were all higher than in the placebo group with non-relapsing leukemia and relapsed leukemia (p<0.05). Less patients in the HSS group experienced gastrointestinal side effects from chemotherapy, whereas more patients had increased food take and an increase in Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score (p<0.01). In vitro, the expression of P-gp and sorcin in the HSS treated cells were lower than in the control group cells (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: When added to conventional chemotherapy, HSS improves the complete remission rates and quality of life in patients with acute leukemia. The in vitro findings indicate that suppression of P-gp and sorcin genes in leukemia cells may be involved in the beneficial effects of HSS.","['Li, Guang-Yao', 'Zhang, Li', 'Liu, Ji-Zhu', 'Chen, Shou-Guo', 'Xiao, Tai-Wu', 'Liu, Guo-Zhen', 'Wang, Jing-Xia', 'Wang, Le-Xin', 'Hou, Ming']","['Li GY', 'Zhang L', 'Liu JZ', 'Chen SG', 'Xiao TW', 'Liu GZ', 'Wang JX', 'Wang LX', 'Hou M']","[""Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, PR China; Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong 252000, PR China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong 252000, PR China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong 252000, PR China."", 'Haisheng Oncology Hospital of Qingdao, Qingdao, Shandong 266031, PR China.', ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong 252000, PR China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong 252000, PR China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong 252000, PR China."", 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Charles Sturt University, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2650, Australia.

Exposure of K562 cells to doxorubicin led to increased hyaluronic acid synthase (HAS) gene expression and increased levels of cell surface hyaluronic acid. Furthermore, exposure of K562 cells to exogenous HA caused resistance to doxorubicin-induced cell death. The combination of low dose 4-MU and doxorubicin led to increased apoptosis when compared to higher doses of any agent alone. Additionally, treatment with 4-MU led to a significant reduction in doxorubicin-induced increase in HA cell surface expression. Mechanistically, 4-MU treatment led to an increase in p38 activation and PARP cleavage. The role of p38 in 4-MU/doxorubicin-treated K562 cells was confirmed when p38 inhibitors led to protection from 4-MU/doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.

Although this cognitive decline severely affects patients' quality of life, little is known about effective treatments. Exercise programs represent a promising supportive strategy in this field. However, evidence is sparse and existing studies display methodological limitations. In the planned study, 83 men and women newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) will be randomized into one of three treatment groups. During 4weeks of induction chemotherapy with Anthracycline and Cytarabin patients allocated to exercise group will cycle 3x/week for 30min at moderate to vigorous intensity on an ergometer. Patients allocated to placebo group will receive a supervised myofascial release training (3x/week, approx. 30min) and patients at control group will get usual care. As primary endpoints a cognitive test battery will be conducted measuring performances depending on verbal/spatial memory and executive functioning. Secondary endpoints will be self-perceived cognitive functioning, as well as neurotrophic and inflammatory serum markers. All assessments will be conducted immediately after hospitalization and before chemotherapy is commenced, immediately before discharge of hospital after 4-5weeks as well as before continuing medical treatment 3-4weeks after discharge. This will be the first study investigating the impact of an aerobic exercise training on CRCI in AML/MDS patients. We hope that the study design and the state-of-the-art assessments will help to increase knowledge about CRCI in general and exercise as potential treatment option in this under investigated population.","['Zimmer, P', 'Oberste, M', 'Bloch, W', 'Schenk, A', 'Joisten, N', 'Hartig, P', 'Wolf, F', 'Baumann, F T', 'Garthe, A', 'Hallek, M', 'Elter, T']","['Zimmer P', 'Oberste M', 'Bloch W', 'Schenk A', 'Joisten N', 'Hartig P', 'Wolf F', 'Baumann FT', 'Garthe A', 'Hallek M', 'Elter T']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Sport Medicine, Institute of Cardiovascular Research and Sports Medicine, German Sport University Cologne, Am Sportpark Mungersdorf 6, 50933 Cologne, Germany.

The seasonality of these infections, differences in sampling strategies across institutions, and small sample size of published studies make it difficult to appreciate the true incidence and impact of hMPV infections. In this systematic review, we summarized the published data on hMPV infections in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients and patients with hematologic malignancy, focusing on incidence, hMPV-associated lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), mortality, prevention, and management with ribavirin and/or intravenous immunoglobulins. Although the incidence of hMPV infections and hMPV-associated LRTI in this patient population is similar to respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus and despite lack of directed antiviral therapy, the mortality rate remains low unless patients develop LRTI. In the absence of vaccine to prevent hMPV, infection control measures are recommended to reduce its burden in cancer patients.","['Shah, Dimpy P', 'Shah, Pankil K', 'Azzi, Jacques M', 'El Chaer, Firas', 'Chemaly, Roy F']","['Shah DP', 'Shah PK', 'Azzi JM', 'El Chaer F', 'Chemaly RF']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

Tumor metastases to skin, skin involvement by primary breast carcinoma, and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma with secondary involvement by skin were excluded. The total number of primary skin tumors was 204. The commonest cutaneous malignancies were basal cell carcinoma (36%) followed by squamous cell carcinoma (23%), with the head and neck being the commonest location for both tumors. Mycosis fungoides (MF) was the third most common malignancy (11%). Malignant melanoma was the fourth commonest skin malignancy (7%) with the lower extremities being the commonest location.

Recently, there has been a charge toward capturing the patient perspective for those AEs amenable to patient self-reporting via patient-reported outcomes (PRO). The aim of this review was to summarize the empirically reported association between analogous CTCAE and PRO ratings. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases through July 2015. From a total of 5658 articles retrieved, 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Across studies, patients were of mixed cancer types, including anal, breast, cervical, chronic myeloid leukemia, endometrial, hematological, lung, ovarian, pelvic, pharyngeal, prostate, and rectal. Given this mixture, the AEs captured were variable, with many common across studies (e.g., dyspnea, fatigue, nausea, neuropathy, pain, vomiting), as well as several that were disease-specific (e.g., erectile dysfunction, hemoptysis). Overall, the quantified association between CTCAE and PRO ratings fell in the fair to moderate range and had a large variation across the majority of studies (n = 21). CONCLUSIONS: The range of measures used and symptoms captured varied greatly across the reviewed studies. Regardless of concordance metric employed, reported agreement between CTCAE and PRO ratings was moderate at best. To assist with reconciliation and interpretation of these differences toward ultimately improving patient care, an important next step is to explore approaches to integrate PROs with clinician reporting of AEs.","['Atkinson, Thomas M', 'Ryan, Sean J', 'Bennett, Antonia V', 'Stover, Angela M', 'Saracino, Rebecca M', 'Rogak, Lauren J', 'Jewell, Sarah T', 'Matsoukas, Konstantina', 'Li, Yuelin', 'Basch, Ethan']","['Atkinson TM', 'Ryan SJ', 'Bennett AV', 'Stover AM', 'Saracino RM', 'Rogak LJ', 'Jewell ST', 'Matsoukas K', 'Li Y', 'Basch E']","['Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 641 Lexington Ave., 7th Floor, New York, NY, 10022, USA. atkinsot@mskcc.org.', 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 641 Lexington Ave., 7th Floor, New York, NY, 10022, USA.', 'City University of New York, New York, NY, USA.', 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 641 Lexington Ave., 7th Floor, New York, NY, 10022, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 641 Lexington Ave., 7th Floor, New York, NY, 10022, USA.', 'Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 641 Lexington Ave., 7th Floor, New York, NY, 10022, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 641 Lexington Ave., 7th Floor, New York, NY, 10022, USA.', 'Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 641 Lexington Ave., 7th Floor, New York, NY, 10022, USA.', 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160603,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/*standards', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Patient Reported Outcome Measures', 'Self Report']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Drug monitoring', '*Drug-related side effects and adverse reactions', '*Literature review', '*Neoplasms', '*Self report', '*Toxicity']",2016/06/05 06:00,2017/09/25 06:00,['2016/06/05 06:00'],"['2016/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00520-016-3297-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-016-3297-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2016 Aug;24(8):3669-76. doi: 10.1007/s00520-016-3297-9.

Several reports indicated the advantage of continue long-term adherence associated with positive outcome. Therefore, it is important to better understand from the patient's standpoint the experience of living with the disease and the related treatment. OBJECTIVES: In this study, quantitative analysis and narrative medicine were combined to get insights on this issue in a population of 257 patients with CML in chronic phase treated with TKIs (43 % men, with a median age of 58 years, 27 % aged 31-50 years), followed for a median time of 5 years. Sixty-one percent of patients enrolled were treated in first line, whereas 37 % were treated in second line. RESULTS: The results showed more positive perceptions and acceptance in males compared to females, without impact of disease on relationships. Level of positive acceptance was more evident in elderly compared to younger patients, with a close connection with median time from diagnosis. Overall, female patients reported negative perceptions and an impact of disease on family daily living. The majority of patients understood the importance of continue adherence to treatment, with 27 % resulting less adherent (60 % for forgetfulness), even if well informed and supported by his/her physician. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Narrative medicine, in association to quantitative analysis, can help physicians to understand needs of their patients in order to improve communication.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Graffigna, Guendalina', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Pungolino, Ester', 'Pizzuti, Michele', 'Maggi, Alessandro', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Capalbo, Silvana Franca', 'Intermesoli, Tamara', 'Maffioli, Margherita', 'Elena, Chiara', 'Melosi, Alessandro', 'Simonetti, Federico', 'Capochiani, Enrico', 'Seta, Roberta Della', 'Pacilli, Matteo', 'Luppi, Mario', 'Di Renzo, Nicola', 'Mastrullo, Lucia', 'Trabacchi, Elena', 'Vallisa, Daniele', 'Rapezzi, Davide', 'Orlandi, Ester Maria', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Efficace, Fabio', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Breccia M', 'Graffigna G', 'Galimberti S', 'Iurlo A', 'Pungolino E', 'Pizzuti M', 'Maggi A', 'Falzetti F', 'Capalbo SF', 'Intermesoli T', 'Maffioli M', 'Elena C', 'Melosi A', 'Simonetti F', 'Capochiani E', 'Seta RD', 'Pacilli M', 'Luppi M', 'Di Renzo N', 'Mastrullo L', 'Trabacchi E', 'Vallisa D', 'Rapezzi D', 'Orlandi EM', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Efficace F', 'Alimena G']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it.', 'Department of Psychology, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology, Pisa, Italy.', 'Oncoematologia, Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', ""Niguarda Ca' Grande Hospital, Milan, Italy."", 'Hematology, San Carlo Hospital, Potenza, Italy.', 'Hematology, Moscati Hospital, Taranto, Italy.', 'Hematology, Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology, A.O.

Heterozygous germ line GATA2 mutations induce GATA2-deficiency syndrome, characterized by monocytopenia, a predisposition to myelodysplasia/acute myeloid leukemia, and a profoundly reduced DC population, which is associated with increased susceptibility to viral infections, impaired phagocytosis, and decreased cytokine production. To define the role of GATA2 in DC differentiation and function, we studied Gata2 conditional knockout and haploinsufficient mice. Gata2 conditional deficiency significantly reduced the DC count, whereas Gata2 haploinsufficiency did not affect this population. GATA2 was required for the in vitro generation of DCs from Lin(-)Sca-1(+)Kit(+) cells, common myeloid-restricted progenitors, and common dendritic cell precursors, but not common lymphoid-restricted progenitors or granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, suggesting that GATA2 functions in the myeloid pathway of DC differentiation. Moreover, expression profiling demonstrated reduced expression of myeloid-related genes, including mafb, and increased expression of T-lymphocyte-related genes, including Gata3 and Tcf7, in Gata2-deficient DC progenitors. In addition, GATA2 was found to bind an enhancer element 190-kb downstream region of Gata3, and a reporter assay exhibited significantly reduced luciferase activity after adding this enhancer region to the Gata3 promoter, which was recovered by GATA sequence deletion within Gata3 +190. These results suggest that GATA2 plays an important role in cell-fate specification toward the myeloid vs T-lymphocyte lineage by regulating lineage-specific transcription factors in DC progenitors, thereby contributing to DC differentiation.","['Onodera, Koichi', 'Fujiwara, Tohru', 'Onishi, Yasushi', 'Itoh-Nakadai, Ari', 'Okitsu, Yoko', 'Fukuhara, Noriko', 'Ishizawa, Kenichi', 'Shimizu, Ritsuko', 'Yamamoto, Masayuki', 'Harigae, Hideo']","['Onodera K', 'Fujiwara T', 'Onishi Y', 'Itoh-Nakadai A', 'Okitsu Y', 'Fukuhara N', 'Ishizawa K', 'Shimizu R', 'Yamamoto M', 'Harigae H']","['Department of Hematology and Rheumatology.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Molecular Hematology/Oncology, and.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology.', 'Biochemistry, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan;', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Yamagata University Faculty of Medicine, Yamagata, Japan; and.', 'Molecular Hematology and.', 'Medical Biochemistry, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Molecular Hematology/Oncology, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160603,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gata3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha)', '0 (Hnf1a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics/*immunology', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor/genetics/immunology', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-alpha/genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology']",,,2016/06/05 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/06/05 06:00'],"['2016/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34305-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-02-698118 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jul 28;128(4):508-18. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-02-698118.

Monitoring the response in patients receiving therapy is a standard of care. The present study was conducted to assess the monitoring adherence and reliableness of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) as a monitoring tool and the effect of a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) assessed by FISH on the prognosis of patients in a chronic phase (CP)-CML cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data from 63 newly diagnosed CP-CML patients treated with imatinib mesylate at a dose of 400 mg/day as frontline therapy. The clinical data and cytogenetic test results at diagnosis and during monitoring were collected. The cytogenetic monitoring adherence assessment rates were measured. A correlation between chromosome banding analysis (CBA) and FISH was performed. The CCyR assessed by FISH was defined as < 1% BCR-ABL1(+) nuclei. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for overall survival analysis and time-to-event estimates. RESULTS: The cytogenetic monitoring assessment adherence was 50.8% at 3 months, 93.5% at 6 months, 96.7% at 12 months, and 88.6% at 18 months. The Pearson correlation coefficient showed a significantly positive association (r = 0.84; P < .001) between CBA and FISH. The median follow-up duration after imatinib mesylate initiation was 60 months. A CCyR was achieved in 90.4% of patients within the first 18 months of therapy. At 3 months, 31 patients underwent a FISH evaluation, and 13 (41.9%) had achieved a CCyR. The patients who did not achieve a CCyR at 3 months had a significantly inferior probability of 5-year failure-free survival (38% vs. 94%; P = .001) and progression-free survival (80% vs. 100%; P = .043) compared with those with a CCyR. CONCLUSION: We found improved monitoring adherence compared with the previous reports of Latin American populations. In countries with a high incidence of failure for CBA and a lack of real-time polymerase chain reaction standardization, FISH is a sensitive monitoring tool. In our cohort, patients not achieving an early CCyR, as tested by FISH, were a poor prognosis subgroup with worse rates of failure-free survival and progression-free survival.","['Bourlon, Christianne', 'Hernandez-Mata, Carlos', 'Vargas-Serafin, Cesar', 'Bourlon, Maria T', 'Tuna-Aguilar, Elena', 'Aguayo, Alvaro']","['Bourlon C', 'Hernandez-Mata C', 'Vargas-Serafin C', 'Bourlon MT', 'Tuna-Aguilar E', 'Aguayo A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico.

Somatic mutation importance in the pathogenesis or disease progression of histiocytic sarcoma was largely unknown. To identify somatic mutations in histiocytic sarcoma, we studied 5 histiocytic sarcomas [3 female and 2 male patients; mean age 54.8 (20-72), anatomic sites include lymph node, uterus, and pleura] and matched normal tissues from each patient as germ line controls. Somatic mutations in 50 ""Hotspot"" oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes were examined using next generation sequencing. Three (out of five) histiocytic sarcoma cases carried somatic mutations in BRAF. Among them, G464V [variant frequency (VF) of 43.6 %] and G466R (VF of 29.6 %) located at the P loop potentially interfere with the hydrophobic interaction between P and activating loops and ultimately activation of BRAF. Also detected was BRAF somatic mutation N581S (VF of 7.4 %), which was located at the catalytic loop of BRAF kinase domain: its role in modifying kinase activity was unclear. A similar mutational analysis was also performed on nine acute monocytic/monoblastic leukemia cases, which did not identify any BRAF somatic mutations. Our study detected several BRAF mutations in histiocytic sarcomas, which may be important in understanding the tumorigenesis of this rare neoplasm and providing mechanisms for potential therapeutical opportunities.","['Liu, Qingqing', 'Tomaszewicz, Keith', 'Hutchinson, Lloyd', 'Hornick, Jason L', 'Woda, Bruce', 'Yu, Hongbo']","['Liu Q', 'Tomaszewicz K', 'Hutchinson L', 'Hornick JL', 'Woda B', 'Yu H']","['Department of Pathology, UMass Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, UMass Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, UMass Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, UMass Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, UMass Memorial Medical Center and University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.

MUC1-C is a transmembrane oncoprotein that is aberrantly expressed in AML stem-like cells. The present studies demonstrate that targeting MUC1-C with silencing or a pharmacologic inhibitor GO-203 suppresses DNMT1 expression. In addition, MUC1 expression positively correlates with that of DNMT1 in primary AML cells, particularly the CD34+/CD38- population. The mechanistic basis for this relationship is supported by the demonstration that MUC1-C activates the NF-kappaB p65 pathway, promotes occupancy of the MUC1-C/NF-kappaB complex on the DNMT1 promoter and drives DNMT1 transcription. We also show that targeting MUC1-C substantially reduces gene promoter-specific DNA methylation, and derepresses expression of tumor suppressor genes, including CDH1, PTEN and BRCA1. In support of these results, we demonstrate that combining GO-203 with the DNMT1 inhibitor decitabine is highly effective in reducing DNMT1 levels and decreasing AML cell survival. These findings indicate that (i) MUC1-C is an attractive target for the epigentic reprogramming of AML cells, and (ii) targeting MUC1-C in combination with decitabine is a potentially effective clinical approach for the treatment of AML.","['Tagde, Ashujit', 'Rajabi, Hasan', 'Stroopinsky, Dina', 'Gali, Reddy', 'Alam, Maroof', 'Bouillez, Audrey', 'Kharbanda, Surender', 'Stone, Richard', 'Avigan, David', 'Kufe, Donald']","['Tagde A', 'Rajabi H', 'Stroopinsky D', 'Gali R', 'Alam M', 'Bouillez A', 'Kharbanda S', 'Stone R', 'Avigan D', 'Kufe D']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CDH1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (MUC1 protein, human)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NFKB1 protein, human)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cadherins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Synergism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mucin-1/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['CDH1', 'DNA methylation', 'DNMT1', 'MUC1-C', 'decitabine']",2016/10/27 06:00,2018/01/23 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2016/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['9777 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9777 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 28;7(26):38974-38987. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9777.,10.18632/oncotarget.9777 [doi],"['P50 CA100707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA097098/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166480/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5129907,"['D.K holds equity in Genus Oncology and is a consultant to the company.

Both inhibitors trigger apoptosis in CLL B cells and gene expression profiles studies denoted how a substantial part of genes up-regulated by these compounds are elements of adaptive responses, aimed to sustain cell survival. 2cPE treatment elicits the up-regulation of chaperones, proteasomal subunits and elements of the anti-oxidant response. Selective inhibition of these responses augments apoptosis in response to 2cPE treatment. We have also observed that the product of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM) is activated in 2cPE treated cells. Stimulation of ATM signaling is possibly dependent on the alteration of the redox homeostasis. Importantly ATM inhibition, mutations or down-modulation increase cell death in response to 2cPE.

Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL), a histone methyltransferase, was upregulated, leading to increased trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4, while G9a was downregulated, leading to decreased dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9. siRNA-mediated MLL knockdown decreased levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 to a greater extent than did silencing HAT1. Host cell factor 1 (HCF1) was upregulated in SNUC5/5-FUR cells, and we observed interaction between HCF1 and MLL. Upregulation of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), an activator of HCF1, was also associated with HCF1-MLL interaction. In SNUC5/5-FUR cells, a larger fraction of OGT was bound to TET1, which recruits OGT to the Nrf2 promoter region, than in SNUC5 cells. These findings indicate that SNUC5/5-FUR cells are under oxidative stress, which induces expression of histone methylation-related proteins as well as DNA demethylase, leading to upregulation of Nrf2 and 5-FU resistance.","['Kang, Kyoung Ah', 'Piao, Mei Jing', 'Ryu, Yea Seong', 'Kang, Hee Kyoung', 'Chang, Weon Young', 'Keum, Young Sam', 'Hyun, Jin Won']","['Kang KA', 'Piao MJ', 'Ryu YS', 'Kang HK', 'Chang WY', 'Keum YS', 'Hyun JW']","['School of Medicine, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Medicine, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Medicine, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Medicine, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Medicine, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Dongguk University, Goyang 10326, Republic of Korea.', 'School of Medicine, Jeju National University, Jeju 63243, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (TET1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (O-GlcNAc transferase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/metabolism', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry', 'Lysine/chemistry', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/*metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/metabolism', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['5-fluorouracil-resistance', 'DNA demethylase', 'Nrf2 transcription factor', 'histone methyltransferase', 'oxidative stress']",2016/10/27 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2016/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['9745 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9745 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 28;7(26):40594-40620. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9745.,10.18632/oncotarget.9745 [doi],,PMC5130030,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, in the four-generation family UW-AP, linkage analysis revealed four regions that provided the maximal LOD scores possible, one of which was in a commonly microdeleted chromosome 7q region. Exome sequencing identified a missense mutation (c.2640C>A, p.His880Gln) in the sterile alpha motif domain containing 9-like gene (SAMD9L) that completely cosegregated with disease. By targeted sequencing of SAMD9L, we subsequently identified a different missense mutation (c.3587G>C, p.Cys1196Ser) in affected members of the first described family with AP syndrome, Li-AP. Neither variant is reported in the public databases, both affect highly conserved amino acid residues, and both are predicted to be damaging. With time in culture, lymphoblastic cell lines (LCLs) from two affected individuals in family UW-AP exhibited copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity for large portions of the long arm of chromosome 7, resulting in retention of only the wild-type SAMD9L allele. Newly established LCLs from both individuals demonstrated the same phenomenon. In addition, targeted capture and sequencing of SAMD9L in uncultured blood DNA from both individuals showed bias toward the wild-type allele. These observations indicate in vivo hematopoietic mosaicism. The hematopoietic cytopenias that characterize AP syndrome and the selective advantage for clones that have lost the mutant allele support the postulated role of SAMD9L in the regulation of cell proliferation. Furthermore, we show that AP syndrome is distinct from the dyskeratoses congenita telomeropathies, with which it shares some clinical characteristics.","['Chen, Dong-Hui', 'Below, Jennifer E', 'Shimamura, Akiko', 'Keel, Sioban B', 'Matsushita, Mark', 'Wolff, John', 'Sul, Youngmee', 'Bonkowski, Emily', 'Castella, Maria', 'Taniguchi, Toshiyasu', 'Nickerson, Deborah', 'Papayannopoulou, Thalia', 'Bird, Thomas D', 'Raskind, Wendy H']","['Chen DH', 'Below JE', 'Shimamura A', 'Keel SB', 'Matsushita M', 'Wolff J', 'Sul Y', 'Bonkowski E', 'Castella M', 'Taniguchi T', 'Nickerson D', 'Papayannopoulou T', 'Bird TD', 'Raskind WH']","['Department of Neurology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', 'Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195, USA; Division of Hematology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195, USA; Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA 98105, USA; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA."", 'Division of Hematology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.', 'Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195, USA; Division of Medical Genetics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98195, USA; Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center, Veterans Administration Puget Sound Veterans Health Care Center, Seattle, WA 98108, USA.

The present review highlights recent advances in the understanding of genetic alterations leading to deregulation of HOXA9 and the downstream mechanisms of HOXA9-mediated transformation. RECENT FINDINGS: A variety of genetic alterations including MLL translocations, NUP98-fusions, NPM1 mutations, CDX deregulation, and MOZ-fusions lead to high-level HOXA9 expression in acute leukemias. The mechanisms resulting in HOXA9 overexpression are beginning to be defined and represent attractive therapeutic targets. Small molecules targeting MLL-fusion protein complex members, such as DOT1L and menin, have shown promising results in animal models, and a DOT1L inhibitor is currently being tested in clinical trials. Essential HOXA9 cofactors and collaborators are also being identified, including transcription factors PU.1 and C/EBPalpha, which are required for HOXA9-driven leukemia. HOXA9 targets including IGF1, CDX4, INK4A/INK4B/ARF, mir-21, and mir-196b and many others provide another avenue for potential drug development. SUMMARY: HOXA9 deregulation underlies a large subset of aggressive acute leukemias. Understanding the mechanisms regulating the expression and activity of HOXA9, along with its critical downstream targets, shows promise for the development of more selective and effective leukemia therapies.","['Collins, Cailin T', 'Hess, Jay L']","['Collins CT', 'Hess JL']","['aDepartment of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MichiganbIndiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2016/06/04 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000245 [doi]', '00062752-201607000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2016 Jul;23(4):354-61. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000245.,10.1097/MOH.0000000000000245 [doi],['R01 CA151425/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5653247,,,,,,['NIHMS802962'],,,,,,,,,,

Particularly in neutropenic patients, it is important to consider L. prolificans when a fungal infection is suspected and antifungal agents are ineffective.","['Tamaki, M', 'Nozaki, K', 'Onishi, M', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Ujiie, H', 'Sugahara, H']","['Tamaki M', 'Nozaki K', 'Onishi M', 'Yamamoto K', 'Ujiie H', 'Sugahara H']","['Department of Hematology, Sumitomo Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sumitomo Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sumitomo Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sumitomo Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sumitomo Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sumitomo Hospital, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160802,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Glucocorticoids/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Meninges/pathology', 'Meningitis, Fungal/cerebrospinal fluid/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisolone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Scedosporium/*isolation & purification', 'Tacrolimus/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Lomentospora prolifican', 'Scedosporium prolificans', 'lomentosporiosis', 'meningitis', 'mold', 'stem cell transplant']",2016/06/04 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2015/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2015/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tid.12563 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2016 Aug;18(4):601-5. doi: 10.1111/tid.12563.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent attractive therapeutic targets, accounting for approximately 30% of all targets of marketed drugs. Using next-generation sequencing, we studied the expression of 772 GPCRs in 148 genetically diverse AML specimens, normal blood and bone marrow cell populations as well as cord blood-derived CD34-positive cells. Among these receptors, 30 are overexpressed and 19 are downregulated in AML samples compared with normal CD34-positive cells. Upregulated GPCRs are enriched in chemokine (CCR1, CXCR4, CCR2, CX3CR1, CCR7 and CCRL2), adhesion (CD97, EMR1, EMR2 and GPR114) and purine (including P2RY2 and P2RY13) receptor subfamilies. The downregulated receptors include adhesion GPCRs, such as LPHN1, GPR125, GPR56, CELSR3 and GPR126, protease-activated receptors (F2R and F2RL1) and the Frizzled family receptors SMO and FZD6. Interestingly, specific deregulation was observed in genetically distinct subgroups of AML, thereby identifying different potential therapeutic targets in these frequent AML subgroups.","['Maiga, A', 'Lemieux, S', 'Pabst, C', 'Lavallee, V-P', 'Bouvier, M', 'Sauvageau, G', 'Hebert, J']","['Maiga A', 'Lemieux S', 'Pabst C', 'Lavallee VP', 'Bouvier M', 'Sauvageau G', 'Hebert J']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Computer Science and Operations Research, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Leukemia Cell Bank of Quebec, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Leukemia Cell Bank of Quebec, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160603,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood/*genetics', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']",,,2016/06/04 06:00,2017/11/04 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2016/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201636 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2016.36 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2016 Jun 3;6(6):e431. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2016.36.,10.1038/bcj.2016.36 [doi],,PMC5141352,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BiTEs were secreted from the transferred T cells and enabled both the transferred and bystander T cells to specifically recognize CD19(+) cell lines, with increased tumor killing ability, prolonged functional persistence, increased cytokine production and potent proliferation compared with the CAR-T cells. More interestingly, in comparison with CD3/CD28 bead-stimulated T cells, T cells that were expanded by a rapid T-cell expansion protocol (REP) showed enhanced anti-tumor activities for both CAR and BiTE RNA-electroporated T cells both in vitro and in a Nalm6 mouse model (P<0.01).

To provide further knowledge about children's ELF-MF exposure correlated to children's daily activities, a measurement study was conducted in Milan (Italy). Eighty-six children were recruited, 52 of whom were specifically chosen with respect to the distance to power lines and built-in transformers to oversample potentially highly exposed children. Personal and bedroom measurements were performed for each child in two different seasons. The major outcomes of this study are: (1) median values over 24-h personal and bedroom measurements were <3 muT established by the Italian law as the quality target; (2) geometric mean values over 24-h bedroom measurements were mostly <0.4 muT; (3) seasonal variations did not significantly influence personal and bedroom measurements; (4) the highest average MF levels were mostly found at home during the day and outdoors; (5) no significant differences were found in the median and geometric mean values between personal and bedroom measurements, but were found in the arithmetic mean.","['Liorni, Ilaria', 'Parazzini, Marta', 'Struchen, Benjamin', 'Fiocchi, Serena', 'Roosli, Martin', 'Ravazzani, Paolo']","['Liorni I', 'Parazzini M', 'Struchen B', 'Fiocchi S', 'Roosli M', 'Ravazzani P']","[""CNR Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni IEIIT, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci, Milano 20133, Italy. ilaria.liorni@ieiit.cnr.it."", ""CNR Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni IEIIT, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci, Milano 20133, Italy. marta.parazzini@ieiit.cnr.it."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel 4002, Switzerland. benjamin.struchen@unibas.ch.', 'University of Basel, Basel 4003, Switzerland. benjamin.struchen@unibas.ch.', ""CNR Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni IEIIT, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci, Milano 20133, Italy. serena.fiocchi@ieiit.cnr.it."", 'Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel 4002, Switzerland. martin.roosli@unibas.ch.', 'University of Basel, Basel 4003, Switzerland. martin.roosli@unibas.ch.', ""CNR Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni IEIIT, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci, Milano 20133, Italy. paolo.ravazzani@ieiit.cnr.it.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160531,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', '*Child Health', 'Child, Preschool', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Language', 'Leukemia', 'Male', 'Seasons']",['NOTNLM'],"['*children', '*exposure assessment', '*extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF)', '*personal measurement', '*power line', '*transformer']",2016/06/04 06:00,2017/07/18 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2016/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph13060549 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph13060549 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2016 May 31;13(6). pii: ijerph13060549. doi: 10.3390/ijerph13060549.,10.3390/ijerph13060549 [doi] E549 [pii],,PMC4924006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we identified a soluble form of DNAM-1 (sDNAM-1) in human sera. In retrospective univariate and multivariate analyses of allo-HSCT patients (n = 71) at a single center, cumulative incidences of all grade (grade I-IV) and sgrade II-IV aGVHD in patients with high maximal serum levels of sDNAM-1 (>/=30 pM) in the 7 days before allo-HSCT were significantly higher than those in patients with low maximal serum levels of sDNAM-1 (<30 pM) in the same period.

Our data suggest that sDNAM-1 is potentially a unique candidate as a predictive biomarker for the development of aGVHD.","['Kanaya, Minoru', 'Shibuya, Kazuko', 'Hirochika, Rei', 'Kanemoto, Miyoko', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru', 'Okada, Masafumi', 'Wagatsuma, Yukiko', 'Cho, Yukiko', 'Kojima, Hiroshi', 'Teshima, Takanori', 'Imamura, Masahiro', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Shibuya, Akira']","['Kanaya M', 'Shibuya K', 'Hirochika R', 'Kanemoto M', 'Ohashi K', 'Okada M', 'Wagatsuma Y', 'Cho Y', 'Kojima H', 'Teshima T', 'Imamura M', 'Sakamaki H', 'Shibuya A']","['Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Trial and Clinical Epidemiology, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Trial and Clinical Epidemiology, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Ibaraki Prefectural Central Hospital, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Ibaraki Clinical Education and Training Center, University of Tsukuba Hospital, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Life Science Center of Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance (TARA), University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Japan Science and Technology Agency, Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST), University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160603,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD226 antigen)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/06/04 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2016/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0154173 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-05445 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jun 3;11(6):e0154173. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0154173. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0154173 [doi],,PMC4892670,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many of these disorders, imaging is used to evaluate the extent of disease, guide biopsy, and/or monitor disease activity and patient response to therapy. Lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma commonly manifest as multiple parenchymal or perinephric lesions. Erdheim-Chester disease and Rosai-Dorfman disease, rare forms of multisystemic histiocytosis, are often identified as perinephric and periureteral masses. Renal abnormalities depicted at imaging in patients with sickle cell disease include renal enlargement, papillary necrosis, and renal medullary carcinoma. Sickle cell disease, along with other causes of intravascular hemolysis, can also lead to hemosiderosis of the renal cortex. Thrombosis of renal veins is sometimes seen in patients with coagulation disorders but more often occurs in association with certain malignancies and nephrotic syndrome. Immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing disease is another multisystem process that often produces focal renal lesions, seen along with involvement of more characteristic organs such as the pancreas. Perinephric lesions with calcifications should raise the possibility of secondary amyloidosis, especially in patients with a history of lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Although the imaging patterns of renal and perinephric involvement are usually not specific for a single entity, and the same entity can manifest with different or overlapping patterns, familiarity with these patterns and key clinical and histopathologic features may help to narrow the differential diagnosis and determine the next step of care.

This article provides an overview of some of the recent findings in this field and also reports two single case vignettes that offer insight into day-to-day applications of clinical music therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the collection of clinical studies of music therapy in oncology, the databases AMED, CAIRSS, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and PSYNDEX were searched with the terms ""Study OR Trial"" AND ""Music Therapy"" AND ""Cancer OR Oncolog$."" Studies were analyzed with respect to their design, setting and interventions, indications, patients, and outcomes. In addition, two case vignettes present the application of music therapy for a child with leukemia and an adult patient with breast cancer. RESULTS: We found a total of 12 clinical studies conducted between 2001 and 2011 comprised of a total of 922 patients. Eight studies had a randomized controlled design, and four studies were conducted in the field of pediatric oncology. Studies reported heterogeneous results on short-term improvements in patients' mood and relaxation and reduced exhaustion and anxiety as well as in coping with the disease and cancer-related pain. Case descriptions showed similar effects in expressing emotions, opening up new goals, and turning the mind toward a healthy process and away form a disease-centered focus. CONCLUSION: The use of music therapy in the integrative treatment of cancer patients is a therapeutic option whose salutogenetic potential is shown in many case studies such as those presented here. Study results, however, did not draw a conclusive picture of the overall effect of music therapy. In addition to further clinical trials, the evidence mosaic should be complemented with qualitative studies, single case descriptions, and basic research.","['Boyde, Constance', 'Linden, Ulrike', 'Boehm, Katja', 'Ostermann, Thomas']","['Boyde C', 'Linden U', 'Boehm K', 'Ostermann T']","['Constance Boyde is music therapists in the Department of Music Therapy, Community Hospital Herdecke, Germany.', 'Ulrike Linden is music therapists in the Department of Music Therapy, Community Hospital Herdecke, Germany.', 'Katja Boehm, PhD, MSc, is a researcher of Research Methodology, The Center for Integrative Medicine, Witten/Herdecke University, Germany.', 'Thomas Ostermann, PhD, MSc, is professor of Research Methodology, The Center for Integrative Medicine, Witten/Herdecke University, Germany.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20121101,United States,Glob Adv Health Med,Global advances in health and medicine,101584936,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'instruments', 'leukemia', 'mood', 'music therapy', 'pain', 'relaxation']",2012/11/01 00:00,2012/11/01 00:01,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2012/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2012/11/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.7453/gahmj.2012.1.5.009 [doi]', 'gahmj.2012.1.5.009 [pii]']",ppublish,Glob Adv Health Med. 2012 Nov;1(5):24-9. doi: 10.7453/gahmj.2012.1.5.009.

Detection and monitoring of MRD is becoming the standard of care, considering its importance in predicting the treatment outcome. MRD aids in identifying high-risk patients and hence therapy can be intensified in them while deintensification of therapy can prevent long-term sequelae of chemotherapy in low-risk category. FCM is considered as a less labor-intensive and faster MRD technique as compared to PCR although it has its own share of disadvantages. Current immune-based methodologies for detection of MRD depend on establishing leukemia-associated aberrant immunophenotype (LAIP), at diagnosis or relapse and use this information at specified time points for detection of MRD, or apply a standardized panel of antibody combinations for all MRD cases, in a different-from-normal approach.

Here, we explored the feasibility of using the H3K9- and H3K36-specific demethylases Jmjd2/Kdm4 as putative drug targets in MLL-AF9 translocated leukemia. Using Jmjd2a, Jmjd2b, and Jmjd2c conditional triple-knockout mice, we show that Jmjd2/Kdm4 activities are required for MLL-AF9 translocated AML in vivo and in vitro. We demonstrate that expression of the interleukin 3 receptor alpha (Il3ra also known as Cd123) subunit is dependent on Jmjd2/Kdm4 through a mechanism involving removal of H3K9me3 from the promoter of the Il3ra gene. Importantly, ectopic expression of Il3ra in Jmjd2/Kdm4 knockout cells alleviates the requirement of Jmjd2/Kdm4 for the survival of AML cells, showing that Il3ra is a critical downstream target of Jmjd2/Kdm4 in leukemia.

Using different molecular and imaging approaches, we show that AML cells can increase their mitochondrial mass up to 14%. After coculture, recipient AML cells showed a 1.5-fold increase in mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production and were less prone to mitochondrial depolarization after chemotherapy, displaying a higher survival. This unidirectional transfer enhanced by some chemotherapeutic agents required cell-cell contacts and proceeded through an endocytic pathway. Transfer was greater in AML blasts compared with normal cord blood CD34(+) cells.

As mitochondrial transfer provides a clear survival advantage following chemotherapy and a higher leukemic long-term culture initiating cell potential, targeting mitochondrial transfer could represent a future therapeutic target for AML treatment.","['Moschoi, Ruxanda', 'Imbert, Veronique', 'Nebout, Marielle', 'Chiche, Johanna', 'Mary, Didier', 'Prebet, Thomas', 'Saland, Estelle', 'Castellano, Remy', 'Pouyet, Laurent', 'Collette, Yves', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Chabannon, Christian', 'Recher, Christian', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Alcor, Damien', 'Peyron, Jean-Francois', 'Griessinger, Emmanuel']","['Moschoi R', 'Imbert V', 'Nebout M', 'Chiche J', 'Mary D', 'Prebet T', 'Saland E', 'Castellano R', 'Pouyet L', 'Collette Y', 'Vey N', 'Chabannon C', 'Recher C', 'Sarry JE', 'Alcor D', 'Peyron JF', 'Griessinger E']","['INSERM U1065, Mediterranean Centre for Molecular Medicine (C3M), Team 4 Inflammation, Cancer, Cancer Stem Cells, Nice, France; Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France;', 'INSERM U1065, Mediterranean Centre for Molecular Medicine (C3M), Team 4 Inflammation, Cancer, Cancer Stem Cells, Nice, France; Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France;', 'INSERM U1065, Mediterranean Centre for Molecular Medicine (C3M), Team 4 Inflammation, Cancer, Cancer Stem Cells, Nice, France; Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France;', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France; INSERM U1065, C3M, Team 3, Regulation of caspase-dependent and -independent cell deaths, Nice, France;', 'INSERM U1065, Mediterranean Centre for Molecular Medicine (C3M), Team 4 Inflammation, Cancer, Cancer Stem Cells, Nice, France; Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France;', ""Departement d'Onco-Hematologie, Institut Paoli-Calmette, Marseille, France;"", 'Team RESIST@ML-Chemoresistance, Stem Cells & Metabolism in AML, Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, Unite Mixte de Recherche Medicale (UMR) 1037, Toulouse, France;', 'Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR725, Marseille, France; Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, TrGET Platform, INSERM, U1068, Marseille, France; and.', 'Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR725, Marseille, France; Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, TrGET Platform, INSERM, U1068, Marseille, France; and.', 'Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR725, Marseille, France; Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, TrGET Platform, INSERM, U1068, Marseille, France; and.', ""Departement d'Onco-Hematologie, Institut Paoli-Calmette, Marseille, France;"", ""Departement d'Onco-Hematologie, Institut Paoli-Calmette, Marseille, France;"", 'Team RESIST@ML-Chemoresistance, Stem Cells & Metabolism in AML, Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, Unite Mixte de Recherche Medicale (UMR) 1037, Toulouse, France;', 'Team RESIST@ML-Chemoresistance, Stem Cells & Metabolism in AML, Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, Unite Mixte de Recherche Medicale (UMR) 1037, Toulouse, France;', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France; INSERM U1065, C3M, Microscopy Core Facility, Nice, France.', 'INSERM U1065, Mediterranean Centre for Molecular Medicine (C3M), Team 4 Inflammation, Cancer, Cancer Stem Cells, Nice, France; Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France;', 'INSERM U1065, Mediterranean Centre for Molecular Medicine (C3M), Team 4 Inflammation, Cancer, Cancer Stem Cells, Nice, France; Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160602,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'U937 Cells']",,,2016/06/04 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2015/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34363-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-07-655860 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jul 14;128(2):253-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-07-655860.

The study analyzed a closed cohort comprised of Israelis aged 21-89 years, enrolled in a health fund, and followed from 2002 to 2012. Adjusting for age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, we calculated hazard ratios for cancer incidence using Cox regression separately for participants with prevalent and incident diabetes; the latter was further divided by time since diabetes diagnosis. Of the 2,186,196 individuals included in the analysis, 159,104 were classified as having prevalent diabetes, 408,243 as having incident diabetes, and 1,618,849 as free of diabetes. In both men and women, diabetes posed an increased risk of cancers of the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, endometrium, stomach, kidney, brain (benign), brain (malignant), colon/rectum, lung (all, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma), ovary, and bladder, as well as leukemia, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and breast cancer in postmenopausal women. No excess risk was observed for breast cancer in premenopausal women or for thyroid cancer. Diabetes was associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. Hazard ratios for all-site and site-specific cancers were particularly elevated during the first year following diabetes diagnosis. The findings of this large study with a time-dependent approach are consistent with those of previous studies that have observed associations between diabetes and cancer incidence.","['Dankner, Rachel', 'Boffetta, Paolo', 'Balicer, Ran D', 'Boker, Lital Keinan', 'Sadeh, Maya', 'Berlin, Alla', 'Olmer, Liraz', 'Goldfracht, Margalit', 'Freedman, Laurence S']","['Dankner R', 'Boffetta P', 'Balicer RD', 'Boker LK', 'Sadeh M', 'Berlin A', 'Olmer L', 'Goldfracht M', 'Freedman LS']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160602,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*epidemiology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Menopause', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/epidemiology', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*bias (epidemiology)', '*cancer', '*causality', '*diabetes mellitus', '*incidence', '*population', '*type 2 diabetes mellitus']",2016/06/04 06:00,2017/06/14 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2015/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['kwv290 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwv290 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2016 Jun 15;183(12):1098-106. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwv290.

However, whether ribosome biogenesis presents as a therapeutic target to treat AML remains unexplored. Perturbations in ribosome biogenesis trigger the 5S ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP)-Mdm2-p53 ribosomal stress pathway, and induction of this pathway has been shown to have therapeutic efficacy in Myc-driven lymphoma. In the current study we address the physiological and therapeutic role of the 5S RNP-Mdm2-p53 pathway in AML. By utilizing mice that have defective ribosome biogenesis due to downregulation of ribosomal protein S19 (Rps19), we demonstrate that induction of the 5S RNP-Mdm2-p53 pathway significantly delays the initiation of AML. However, even a severe Rps19 deficiency that normally results in acute bone marrow failure has no consistent efficacy on already established disease. Finally, by using mice that harbor a mutation in the Mdm2 gene disrupting its binding to 5S RNP, we show that loss of the 5S RNP-Mdm2-p53 pathway is dispensable for development of AML. Our study suggests that induction of the 5S RNP-Mdm2-p53 ribosomal stress pathway holds limited potential as a single-agent therapy in the treatment of AML.","['Jaako, P', 'Ugale, A', 'Wahlestedt, M', 'Velasco-Hernandez, T', 'Cammenga, J', 'Lindstrom, M S', 'Bryder, D']","['Jaako P', 'Ugale A', 'Wahlestedt M', 'Velasco-Hernandez T', 'Cammenga J', 'Lindstrom MS', 'Bryder D']","['Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Linkoping University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, SciLifeLab, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160603,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (ribosomal protein S19)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Mdm2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Ribonucleoproteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Ribosomal Proteins/deficiency', 'Ribosomes/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism/physiology']",,,2016/06/04 06:00,2017/08/31 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2015/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016159 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.159 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Jan;31(1):213-221. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.159.

In adipocytes, galectin-12 is associated with lipid droplets and regulates lipid metabolism and energy balance, whereas its role in leukocytes is not clear. Analysis of galectin-12 expression in a public data set of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples revealed that it is selectively overexpressed in the M3 subtype, which is also known as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). To investigate the role of galectin-12 in APL cells, we manipulated its expression in the APL cell line, NB4, and measured resultant effects on all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced granulocytic differentiation. With a doxycycline-inducible gene knockdown system, we found that suppression of galectin-12 promoted ATRA-induced neutrophil differentiation but inhibited lipid droplet formation. Our results indicate that overexpression of galectin-12 contributes to a differentiation block in APL cells, and suppression of galectin-12 facilitates granulocytic differentiation. Furthermore, these data suggest that lipogenesis and other aspects of myeloid differentiation can be differentially regulated. Taken together, these findings suggest that galectin-12 may be a target for treatment of the ATRA-resistant subset of APL.","['Xue, Huiting', 'Yang, Ri-Yao', 'Tai, Guihua', 'Liu, Fu-Tong']","['Xue H', 'Yang RY', 'Tai G', 'Liu FT']","['Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of California-Davis, Sacramento, California, USA; School of Life Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; and.', 'Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of California-Davis, Sacramento, California, USA.', 'School of Life Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; and.', 'Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of California-Davis, Sacramento, California, USA; Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Nankang, Taipei, Taiwan ftliu@ucdavis.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160602,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Galectins)', '0 (LGALS12 protein, human)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Galectins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lipids/biosynthesis', 'Lipogenesis/*physiology', 'Myelopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Neutrophils/*pathology', 'PPAR gamma/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Respiratory Burst', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*PPARgamma', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*lipid droplets', '*myeloid differentiation']",2016/06/04 06:00,2017/09/13 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2016/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.1HI0316-134R [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.1HI0316-134R [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2016 Oct;100(4):657-664. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1HI0316-134R.

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical significance of FCM-based detection of MRD (FCM-MRD) before allogeneic HSCT in pediatric ALL. Of 38 pediatric patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT for the first time between 1998 and 2014, 33 patients were in CR and five patients were in non-CR. The CR group was further divided into two groups based on the pretransplant FCM-MRD level: the MRD(neg) (<0.01%; 30 patients) group and the MRD(pos) (>/=0.01%; three patients) group. There were significant differences in the three-yr event-free survival rates between the CR and non-CR group, and between the MRD(neg) and MRD(pos) group. The three-yr cumulative RI in the MRD(neg) group were 27.3% +/- 8.8%, whereas two of the three patients in the MRD(pos) group relapsed within one yr after HSCT. The clinical outcome of the MRD(pos) group was as poor as that of the non-CR group in pediatric ALL. Therefore, an improvement in pretransplant treatment that aims to achieve a more profound remission would contribute to reducing the risk of relapse.","['Umeda, Katsutsugu', 'Hiramatsu, Hidefumi', 'Kawaguchi, Koji', 'Iwai, Atsushi', 'Mikami, Masamitsu', 'Nodomi, Seishiro', 'Saida, Satoshi', 'Heike, Toshio', 'Ohomori, Katsuyuki', 'Adachi, Souichi']","['Umeda K', 'Hiramatsu H', 'Kawaguchi K', 'Iwai A', 'Mikami M', 'Nodomi S', 'Saida S', 'Heike T', 'Ohomori K', 'Adachi S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160603,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'flow cytometry', 'minimal residual disease', 'pediatric']",2016/06/04 06:00,2017/03/18 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2016/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/petr.12732 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2016 Aug;20(5):692-6. doi: 10.1111/petr.12732.

Recently, recurrent somatic mutations of genes encoding core subunits of the spliceosome have been identified in several different cancer types. These mutations are most common in hematologic malignancies like the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but also in occur in several solid tumors at lower frequency. The most frequent mutations occur in SF3B1, U2AF1, SRSF2, and ZRSR2 and are largely exclusive of each other. Mutations in SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2 acquire heterozygous missense mutations in specific codons, resembling oncogenes. ZRSR2 mutations include clear loss-of-function variants, a pattern more common to tumor suppressor genes. These splicing factors are associated with distinct clinical phenotypes and patterns of mutation in different malignancies. Mutations have both diagnostic and prognostic relevance. Splicing factor mutations appear to affect only a minority of transcripts which show little overlap by mutation type. How differences in splicing caused by somatic mutations of spliceosome subunits lead to oncogenesis is not clear and may involve different targets in each disease type. However, cells with mutated splicing machinery may be particularly vulnerable to further disruption of the spliceosome suggesting a novel strategy for the targeted therapy of cancers.","['Bejar, Rafael']",['Bejar R'],"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA, USA. rabejar@ucsd.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)', '0 (Splicing Factor U2AF)', '0 (U2AF1 protein, human)', '0 (ZRSR2 protein, human)', '147153-65-9 (SRSF2 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)']",IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'RNA Splicing/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/genetics/physiology', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/genetics/physiology', 'Splicing Factor U2AF/genetics/physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cancer', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Oncogenesis', 'SF3B1', 'SRSF2', 'Splicing', 'Stem cell', 'U2AF1', 'ZRSR2']",2016/06/04 06:00,2017/07/21 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-319-29073-7_9 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2016;907:215-28. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-29073-7_9.,10.1007/978-3-319-29073-7_9 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Retrospective reviews of patients diagnosed as having T-ALL were studied in the period between May 2005 and August 2013 in Shanghai Children's Medical Center. Predictive values of early treatment responses, including prednisone response, bone marrow morphology on day 35 during induction chemotherapy, and minimal residual disease (MRD) monitored by flow cytometry on day 35 and 55, were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess the survival rates. RESULT: Ninety-nine evaluable patients aged 1-18 years with newly diagnosed T-ALL were enrolled in protocol ALL-2005. The median follow-up period for patients remaining alive in continuous remission was 60 months (24-109 months). The 5-year event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for these patients were 65% and 69%, respectively. Forty-three (43%) patients were older than 10 years at diagnosis. A total of 61 patients presented with initial white blood cell count (WBC)>/=50x10(9)/L. Thirty-seven patients with mediastinal mass were found in this study. Seventy-one patients were defined as prednisone good responders (PGR) on day 8 of prednisone therapy. Ninty-four patients achieved complete remission (CR) on day 35 of induction therapy. MRD negative status (<0.01%) on day 35 were seen in 55% of the 42 assessed patients. MRD negative status on day 55 was seen in 78% of the 52 assessed patients. Patients with high MRD (>1%) on day 55 5-year EFS was 40% were associated with poor prognosis (P=0.03). Early T-cell precursor (ETP) subtype was not associated with treatment outcome in this study. Six patients abandoned therapy, 10 lost to follow-up, 22 had relapsed disease, 1 was diagnosed as having a second tumor and 20 patients died. CONCLUSION: Overall outcome for T-ALL on protocol ALL-2005 is favorable. MRD results on day 55 of induction therapy have important prognostic and therapeutic implications.","['Cai, J Y', 'Xue, H L', 'Chen, J', 'Shen, S H', 'Pan, C', 'Wang, X', 'Zhou, M', 'Tang, Y J', 'Gao, Y J', 'Wang, J M', 'Tang, J Y']","['Cai JY', 'Xue HL', 'Chen J', 'Shen SH', 'Pan C', 'Wang X', 'Zhou M', 'Tang YJ', 'Gao YJ', 'Wang JM', 'Tang JY']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,['VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'China', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lost to Follow-Up', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/06/04 06:00,2017/01/31 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1310.2016.06.014 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2016 Jun 2;54(6):456-60. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1310.2016.06.014.,10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1310.2016.06.014 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While BITEs redirect the large reservoir of resident T cells to tumors, CAR T cells rely on significant in vivo expansion to exert antitumor activity. We have shown that it is feasible to modify T cells to secrete solid tumor antigen-specific BITEs, enabling T cells to redirect resident T cells to tumor cells. To adapt this approach to CD19-positive malignancies we now generated T cells expressing secretable, CD19-specific BITEs (CD19-ENG T cells). CD19-ENG T cells recognized tumor cells in an antigen-dependent manner as judged by cytokine production and tumor killing, and redirected bystander T cells to tumor cells. Infusion of CD19-ENG T cells resulted in regression of leukemia or lymphoma in xenograft models and a survival advantage in comparison to control mice. Genetically modified T cells expressing engager molecules may present a promising addition to current CD19-targeted immunotherapies.","['Velasquez, Mireya Paulina', 'Torres, David', 'Iwahori, Kota',

These idiopathic pancytopenia cases were associated with no specific cause for their pancytopenia (n=28), aplastic anemia (n=13), pancytopenia attributable to liver disease (n=4), pancytopenia associated with autoimmune disease (n=4), and pancytopenia attributed to drug effect (n=4). We also selected 38 bone marrow aspirates from patients presenting with pancytopenia and meeting criteria for a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (n=21) or acute myeloid leukemia (n=17) as malignant comparison cases. Targeted sequencing of the 20 genes was performed on all cases. The idiopathic pancytopenia group had a lower average age (46 vs 66 years, P<0.0001) and a lower number of mutations per case that were statistically significant (0.81 vs 1.18, P=0.045). The frequency of cases with at least one mutation was higher for cases with a diagnosable myeloid neoplasm (68 vs 38%, P=0.012). Except for mutations in U2AF1, which was mutated in 5 of the 38 malignant cases (13.2%) and in none of the idiopathic pancytopenia cases (P=0.011), the frequency of mutations in the genes evaluated was not significantly different between idiopathic pancytopenia and malignant cases. Median and mean clinical follow-up for the idiopathic pancytopenia group was available for 444 and 739 days, respectively. Over this time frame, none of the idiopathic pancytopenia patients was diagnosed with a myelodysplastic syndrome or an acute myeloid leukemia. These findings provide further evidence that identification of mutations in several genes associated with myelodysplastic syndromes should not be used alone to support a diagnosis of a myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Fernandez-Pol, Sebastian', 'Ma, Lisa', 'Ohgami, Robert S', 'Arber, Daniel A']","['Fernandez-Pol S', 'Ma L', 'Ohgami RS', 'Arber DA']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160603,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Pancytopenia/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/06/04 06:00,2018/01/24 06:00,['2016/06/04 06:00'],"['2016/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2016100 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2016.100 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2016 Sep;29(9):996-1003. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2016.100.

High-intensity treatments and complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) injure normal tissues and may increase the risk of frailty even among nongeriatric HCT patients. Objective: To determine the prevalence of frailty in young adult HCT patients (18- to 64-year-olds) and siblings; and the impact of frailty on subsequent mortality in HCT survivors. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study, conducted in August 2015 examined 998 HCT survivors, who underwent transplant procedures between 1974 and 1998, who have survived at least 2 years after HCT, and 297 frequency-matched siblings. The study was performed at City of Hope or University of Minnesota with participants completing surveys at home or in the clinic. Hematopoietic cell transplantation survivors and siblings participating in the Bone Marrow Transplant Survivor Study (BMTSS) completed a frailty survey between February 13, 1999 and June 15, 2005 (median time since HCT: 7.9 years); HCT survivors were followed for subsequent mortality (median: 10.3 years from survey). Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence and predictors of frailty; impact of frailty on subsequent mortality in HCT survivors. Frailty phenotype defined as exhibiting 3 or more of the following characteristics: clinically underweight, exhaustion, low energy expenditure, slow walking speed, and muscle weakness. The national Death Index, Social Security Death Index and medical records were used for mortality assessment as of December 21, 2011. Results: The 998 HCT survivors were a mean (SD) of 42.5 (11.6) years of age, and the 297 matched siblings were 43.8 (10.9) years of age. The prevalence of frailty among young adult HCT patients exceeded 8%. The HCT survivors were 8.4 times more likely to be frail than their siblings (95% CI, 2.0-34.5; P = .003). Among HCT recipients, allogeneic HCT recipients with chronic graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) were at increased risk of frailty compared with autologous HCT (OR,15.02; 95% CI, 6.6-34.3; P < .001); resolved chronic GvHD (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-6.9; P = .04). Cumulative incidence of subsequent all-cause mortality was 39.3% and 14.7% at 10 years for HCT recipients with and without frailty, respectively (P < .001). Frailty was associated with a 2.76-fold (95% CI, 1.7-4.4; P < .001) increased risk of subsequent mortality after adjusting for relevant prognosticators. Conclusions and Relevance: The prevalence of frailty among young-adult HCT survivors approaches that seen in the elderly general population. Frail HCT survivors are at increased risk of subsequent mortality when compared with nonfrail survivors. This study identifies vulnerable populations needing close monitoring to anticipate and manage morbidity and prevent mortality.","['Arora, Mukta', 'Sun, Can-Lan', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Teh, Jennifer Berano', 'Wu, Jessica', 'Francisco, Liton', 'Armenian, Saro H', 'Schad, Amy', 'Namdar, Golnaz', 'Bosworth, Alysia', 'Kuo, Linus', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Bhatia, Smita']","['Arora M', 'Sun CL', 'Ness KK', 'Teh JB', 'Wu J', 'Francisco L', 'Armenian SH', 'Schad A', 'Namdar G', 'Bosworth A', 'Kuo L', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Forman SJ', 'Bhatia S']","['Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope, Duarte, California.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.', 'Division of Hematology/Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope, Duarte, California.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aging, Premature', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Siblings', 'Survivors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/06/03 06:00,2017/02/22 06:00,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['2526051 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.0855 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2016 Oct 1;2(10):1277-1286. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.0855.,10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.0855 [doi],['R01 CA078938/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5078990,['Disclosures: None reported.'],,,,,['NIHMS819824'],,,,,,,,,,

A current data report from Polish Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (PPLLSG).,311-316,"PURPOSE: Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are lymphoproliferative disorders derived from post-thymic cells, that occur extremely rarely in children. The optimal treatment of pediatric PTCL remains still unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten children with PTCL from 3 up to 18 years of age registered by the Polish Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (PPLLSG) were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated with different regimens including protocols: for lymphoblastic lymphoma in 7 cases, for anaplastic large cell lymphoma in 1, CHOP in 1. Five of the 10 patients with PTCL were classified as stage II; 4 as stage III and 1 as stage IV due to extralymphatic organs (bone marrow) involvement. Four histological subtypes of PTCL were recognized: extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENTNT), peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPL), Sezary syndrome (SS). After first-line therapy 9 patients initially achieved complete remission, 4 relapsed, 5 died. One patient achieved remission spontaneously. Three children (1 with stage IV and 2 in relapse) underwent high-dose chemotherapy with allogeneic bone marrow stem cell transplantation and all of them are alive and in CR. RESULTS: The cumulative probability of 5-year overall survival (OS) for our whole group was 63.9% (95%CI: 35.2-88.2%) with a median follow-up time of 48.4 months (range 24-90+ months).

The in silico analysis of the protein from Z. mobilis indicated the presence of a signal peptide in the sequence, as well as high identity to other sequences of L-asparaginases with antileukemic activity. The protein was expressed in a bioreactor with a complex culture medium, yielding 0.13 IU/mL extracellular L-asparaginase and 3.6 IU/mL intracellular L-asparaginase after 4 h of induction with IPTG.

High concentrations of butyrate (>1.5mM) have been shown to activate apoptosis in several cancer cell lines including prostate, breast, and leukemia. Butyrate is also known to influence multiple signaling pathways that are mediators of cytokine production. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of high concentrations of butyrate on the cancer microenvironment vis-a-vis apoptosis, cellular migration, and capacity to modulate cytokine expression in cancer cells. The results indicate that high concentrations of butyrate induced a 2-fold activation of caspase-3 and reduced cell viability by 60% in U937 leukemia cells. Within 24h, butyrate significantly decreased the levels of chemokines CCL2 and CCL5 in HL-60 and U937 cells, and decreased CCL5 in THP-1 leukemia cells. Differential effects were observed in treatments with valproic acid for CCL2 and CCL5 indicating butyrate-specificity. Many of the biological effects examined in this study are linked to activation of the AKT and MAPK signaling pathways; therefore, we investigated whether butyrate alters the levels of phosphorylated forms of these signaling proteins and how it correlated with the expression of chemokines. The results show that butyrate may partially regulate CCL5 production via p38 MAPK. The decrease in p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT levels correlated with the decrease in CCL2 production. These data suggest that while promoting apoptosis, butyrate has the potential to influence the cancer microenvironment by inducing differential expression of cytokines.","['Pulliam, Stephanie R', 'Pellom, Samuel T Jr', 'Shanker, Anil', 'Adunyah, Samuel E']","['Pulliam SR', 'Pellom ST Jr', 'Shanker A', 'Adunyah SE']","['School of Graduate Studies and Research, Meharry Medical College, 1005 Dr. DB Todd, Jr. Blvd., Nashville, TN 37208, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Cancer Biology, School of Medicine, Meharry Medical College, 1005 Dr. DB Todd, Jr. Blvd., Nashville, TN 37208, USA.', 'School of Graduate Studies and Research, Meharry Medical College, 1005 Dr. DB Todd, Jr. Blvd., Nashville, TN 37208, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Cancer Biology, School of Medicine, Meharry Medical College, 1005 Dr. DB Todd, Jr. Blvd., Nashville, TN 37208, USA; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Meharry Medical College, 1005 Dr. DB Todd, Jr. Blvd., Nashville, TN 37208, USA.', 'School of Graduate Studies and Research, Meharry Medical College, 1005 Dr. DB Todd, Jr. Blvd., Nashville, TN 37208, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Cancer Biology, School of Medicine, Meharry Medical College, 1005 Dr. DB Todd, Jr. Blvd., Nashville, TN 37208, USA; Host-Tumor Interactions Research Program, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.', 'School of Graduate Studies and Research, Meharry Medical College, 1005 Dr. DB Todd, Jr. Blvd., Nashville, TN 37208, USA; Department of Biochemistry and Cancer Biology, School of Medicine, Meharry Medical College, 1005 Dr. DB Todd, Jr. Blvd., Nashville, TN 37208, USA.

Thus, translational dysregulation of dyskerin could constitute a mechanism by which the CLL PB B cells acquire an aggressive phenotype and thus have a major role in oncogenesis.","['Sbarrato, T', 'Horvilleur, E', 'Poyry, T', 'Hill, K', 'Chaplin, L C', 'Spriggs, R V', 'Stoneley, M', 'Wilson, L', 'Jayne, S', 'Vulliamy, T', 'Beck, D', 'Dokal, I', 'Dyer, M J S', 'Yeomans, A M', 'Packham, G', 'Bushell, M', 'Wagner, S D', 'Willis, A E']","['Sbarrato T', 'Horvilleur E', 'Poyry T', 'Hill K', 'Chaplin LC', 'Spriggs RV', 'Stoneley M', 'Wilson L', 'Jayne S', 'Vulliamy T', 'Beck D', 'Dokal I', 'Dyer MJ', 'Yeomans AM', 'Packham G', 'Bushell M', 'Wagner SD', 'Willis AE']","['Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, PO Box 138, Lancaster Rd, Leicester LE19HN, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, PO Box 138, Lancaster Rd, Leicester LE19HN, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, PO Box 138, Lancaster Rd, Leicester LE19HN, UK.', 'The Babraham Institute, Babraham, Cambridge, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, PO Box 138, Lancaster Rd, Leicester LE19HN, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, PO Box 138, Lancaster Rd, Leicester LE19HN, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, PO Box 138, Lancaster Rd, Leicester LE19HN, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, PO Box 138, Lancaster Rd, Leicester LE19HN, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Studies, Ernest and Helen Scott Haematology Research Institute, University of Leicester, Lancaster Road, Leicester LE1 7H, UK.', 'Centre for Genomics and Child Health, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, 4 Newark Street, Whitechapel, London E1 2AT, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Studies, Ernest and Helen Scott Haematology Research Institute, University of Leicester, Lancaster Road, Leicester LE1 7H, UK.', 'Centre for Genomics and Child Health, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, 4 Newark Street, Whitechapel, London E1 2AT, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Studies, Ernest and Helen Scott Haematology Research Institute, University of Leicester, Lancaster Road, Leicester LE1 7H, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Centre, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, PO Box 138, Lancaster Rd, Leicester LE19HN, UK.', 'Department of Cancer Studies, Ernest and Helen Scott Haematology Research Institute, University of Leicester, Lancaster Road, Leicester LE1 7H, UK.', 'Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, PO Box 138, Lancaster Rd, Leicester LE19HN, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160602,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DKC1 protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Polyribosomes/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Ribosomal/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosomes/*metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/06/03 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2016148 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.148 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Jun 2;7(6):e2249. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.148.,10.1038/cddis.2016.148 [doi],"['MC_UP_A600_1023/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UP_A600_1024/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",PMC5143378,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we explored the effects of erianin on osteosarcoma (OS) in vitro and in vivo and further elucidated the underlying molecule mechanisms. In this study, we found that erianin potently suppressed cell viability in various OS cell lines. Treatment with erianin induced G2/M-phase arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy in OS cells. Further studies showed that erianin-induced apoptosis and autophagy was attributed to reactive oxygen species (ROS), as N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, attenuated them. Moreover, we found that erianin induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal pathway, which was also blocked by NAC. Downregulation of JNK by its specific inhibitor SP600125 could attenuate apoptosis and autophagy induced by erianin. Finally, erianin in vivo markedly reduced the growth with little organ-related toxicity. In conclusion, erianin induced cell cycle G2/M-phase arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy via the ROS/JNK signaling pathway in human OS. In light of these results, erianin may be a promising agent for anticancer therapy against OS.","['Wang, H', 'Zhang, T', 'Sun, W', 'Wang, Z', 'Zuo, D', 'Zhou, Z', 'Li, S', 'Xu, J', 'Yin, F', 'Hua, Y', 'Cai, Z']","['Wang H', 'Zhang T', 'Sun W', 'Wang Z', 'Zuo D', 'Zhou Z', 'Li S', 'Xu J', 'Yin F', 'Hua Y', 'Cai Z']","[""Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", 'Department of Orthopaedics, Yangpu Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai Tenth Peoples's Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", 'Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai East Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160602,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Bibenzyls)', '0 (Erianin)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '339NCG44TV (Phenol)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Bibenzyls', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Osteosarcoma/*pathology', 'Phenol', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2016/06/03 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2015/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2016138 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.138 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Jun 2;7(6):e2247. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.138.,10.1038/cddis.2016.138 [doi],,PMC5143374,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CIK cells are a heterogeneous effector cell population including T cells (CD3(+) CD56(-) ), natural killer (NK) cells (CD3(-) CD56(+) ) and natural killer T (T-NK) cells (CD3(+) CD56(+) ) that exhibit non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxicity and are generated by ex vivo expansion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the presence of interferon (IFN)-gamma, anti-CD3 antibody, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-15 (IL-15). To facilitate selective target-cell recognition and enhance specific cytotoxicity against B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we transduced CIK cells with a lentiviral vector encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that carries a composite CD28-CD3zeta domain for signaling and a CD19-specific scFv antibody fragment for cell binding (CAR 63.28.z). In vitro analysis revealed high and specific cell killing activity of CD19-targeted CIK/63.28.z cells against otherwise CIK-resistant cancer cell lines and primary B-ALL blasts, which was dependent on CD19 expression and CAR signaling. In a xenograft model in immunodeficient mice, treatment with CIK/63.28.z cells in contrast to therapy with unmodified CIK cells resulted in complete and durable molecular remissions of established primary pre-B-ALL. Our results demonstrate potent antileukemic activity of CAR-engineered CIK cells in vitro and in vivo, and suggest this strategy as a promising approach for adoptive immunotherapy of refractory pre-B-ALL.","['Oelsner, Sarah', 'Wagner, Juliane', 'Friede, Miriam E', 'Pfirrmann, Verena', 'Genssler, Sabrina', 'Rettinger, Eva', 'Buchholz, Christian J', 'Pfeifer, Heike', 'Schubert, Ralf', 'Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Ullrich, Evelyn', 'Bader, Peter', 'Wels, Winfried S']","['Oelsner S', 'Wagner J', 'Friede ME', 'Pfirrmann V', 'Genssler S', 'Rettinger E', 'Buchholz CJ', 'Pfeifer H', 'Schubert R', 'Ottmann OG', 'Ullrich E', 'Bader P', 'Wels WS']","['Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'LOEWE Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Molecular Biotechnology and Gene Therapy, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division for Allergology, Pneumology and Cystic Fibrosis, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Division of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'LOEWE Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt/Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160611,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Engineering/methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/*immunology/transplantation', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/genetics/immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-ALL', '*CD19', '*adoptive immunotherapy', '*chimeric antigen receptor', '*cytokine-induced killer cells']",2016/06/03 06:00,2017/06/10 06:00,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.30217 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2016 Oct 15;139(8):1799-809. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30217.

E. coli was the most common bacteria isolated from the blood and urine cultures (34% in blood, 32% in urine culture) while Staphylococcus Aureus was the most common in the wound culture (35%). The highest level of sensitivity in the organisms with positive blood culture was to Ciprofloxacin, while in positive urine and wound culture was to Imipenem. The highest resistance in blood, urine and wound culture was to Cotrimoxazole. CONCLUSION: According to results obtained from this study, it is necessary to conduct appropriate studies on this issue in specific conditions in our country. The findings of this study can be used in clinics for more accurate diagnosis, more effective treatment before the results of clinical tests are known and also for prevention of infection in cancer patients.","['Abdollahi, Alireza', 'Hakimi, Faezeh', 'Doomanlou, Mahsa', 'Azadegan, Azadeh']","['Abdollahi A', 'Hakimi F', 'Doomanlou M', 'Azadegan A']","['Associate Professor of Pathology, Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Imam Hospital Complex, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran; Associate Professor of Pathology, Thrombosis Hemostasis Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, Imam Hospital Complex, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'MSc in Microbiology, Central Laboratory, Imam Hospital Complex, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'MSc in Laboratory Medicine, Central Laboratory, Imam Hospital Complex, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Clinical fluids', 'Microbial profile']",2016/06/03 06:00,2016/06/03 06:01,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/03 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2016 Apr 1;10(2):61-9.,,,PMC4888150,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both the AML and their neighboring stromal cells show constitutive chemokine release, but chemokines seem to function as regulators of AML cell proliferation only for a subset of patients. Chemokine targeting is therefore considered not only for immunosuppression in allotransplanted patients but also as a possible antileukemic strategy in combination with intensive chemotherapy or as part of disease-stabilizing treatment at least for the subset of patients with chemokine-responsive AML cells. In this study, we characterized more in detail the leukemia cell phenotype of the chemokine-responsive patients. We investigated primary AML cells derived from 79 unselected patients. Standardized in vitro suspension cultures were used to investigate AML cell proliferation, and global gene expression profiles were compared for chemokine responders and non-responders identified through the proliferation assays. CCL28-induced growth modulation was used as marker of chemokine responsiveness, and 38 patients were then classified as chemokine-responsive. The effects of exogenous CCL28 (growth inhibition/enhancement/no effect) thus differed among patients and was also dependent on the presence of exogenous hematopoietic growth factors as well as constitutive AML cell cytokine release. The effect of CCR1 inhibition in the presence of chemokine-secreting mesenchymal stem cells also differed among patients. Chemokine-responsive AML cells showed altered expression of genes important for (i) epigenetic transcriptional regulation, particularly lysine acetylation; (ii) helicase activity, especially DExD/H RNA helicases; and (iii) angioregulatory proteins important for integrin binding. Thus, chemokine responsiveness is part of a complex AML cell phenotype with regard to extracellular communication and transcriptional regulation. Chemokine targeting in chemokine-responsive patients may thereby alter AML cell trafficking and increase their susceptibility toward antileukemic treatment, e.g., conventional chemotherapy or targeting of other phenotypic characteristics of the chemokine-responsive cells.","['Brenner, Annette K', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Brenner AK', 'Reikvam H', 'Bruserud O']","['Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital , Bergen , Norway.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway; Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160525,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CCL28', 'RNA', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemokine', 'epigenetic', 'helicase', 'integrin']",2016/06/03 06:00,2016/06/03 06:01,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2016.00205 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2016 May 25;7:205. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2016.00205. eCollection 2016.,10.3389/fimmu.2016.00205 [doi],,PMC4879142,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although bone marrow fibrosis is seen in a variety of malignant and non-malignant disease states, the deposition of reticulin and collagen fibrosis in the bone marrow of patients with myelofibrosis is believed to be mediated by the myelofibrosis hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell, contributing to an impaired microenvironment favoring malignant over normal hematopoiesis. Increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, lysyl oxidase, transforming growth factor-beta, impaired megakaryocyte function, and aberrant JAK-STAT signaling have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of bone marrow fibrosis. A number of studies indicate that bone marrow fibrosis is an adverse prognostic variable in myeloproliferative neoplasms. However, modern myelofibrosis prognostication systems utilized in risk-adapted treatment approaches do not include bone marrow fibrosis as a prognostic variable. The specific effect on bone marrow fibrosis of JAK2 inhibition, and other rationally based therapies currently being evaluated in myelofibrosis, has yet to be fully elucidated. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only curative therapeutic approach that reliably results in resolution of bone marrow fibrosis in patients with myelofibrosis. Here we review the pathogenesis, biological consequences, and prognostic impact of bone marrow fibrosis. We discuss the rationale of various anti-fibrogenic treatment strategies targeting the clonal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell, aberrant signaling pathways, fibrogenic cytokines, and the tumor microenvironment.","['Zahr, Abdallah Abou', 'Salama, Mohamed E', 'Carreau, Nicole', 'Tremblay, Douglas', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Mesa, Ruben', 'Hoffman, Ronald', 'Mascarenhas, John']","['Zahr AA', 'Salama ME', 'Carreau N', 'Tremblay D', 'Verstovsek S', 'Mesa R', 'Hoffman R', 'Mascarenhas J']","['Division of Hematology Oncology, Mount Sinai Beth Israel, New York, NY, USA.', 'Associated Regional University Pathologists Laboratories, Department of Pathology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA john.mascarenhas@mssm.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cellular Microenvironment', 'Disease Progression', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/*etiology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,,2016/06/03 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2015.141283 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2015.141283 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Jun;101(6):660-71. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2015.141283.,10.3324/haematol.2015.141283 [doi],['P01 CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5013940,,,,['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that lymph node (LN)-derived CLL cells possess a distinct phenotype, and exhibit enhanced capacity for T-cell activation and superior immune synapse formation when compared with paired peripheral blood (PB) samples. LN-derived CLL cells manifest a proliferative, CXCR4(dim)CD5(bright) phenotype compared with those in the PB and higher expression of T-cell activation molecules including CD80, CD86, and HLA-D-related (DR). In addition, LN-CLL cells have higher expression of alpha4beta1 (CD49d) which, as well as being a co-stimulatory molecule, is required for CLL cells to undergo transendothelial migration (TEM) and enter the proliferation centers of the LNs. Using an in vitro system that models circulation and TEM, we showed that the small population of CLL cells that migrate are CXCR4(dim)CD5(bright) with higher CD49d, CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR compared with those that remain circulating; a phenotype strikingly similar to LN-derived CLL cells. Furthermore, sorted CD49d(hi) CLL cells showed an enhanced capacity to activate T cells compared with CD49d(lo) subpopulations from the same patient. Thus, although PB-CLL cells have a reduced capacity to form immune synapses and activate CD4(+) T cells, this was not the case for LN-CLL cells or those with the propensity to undergo TEM.

Despite the causative role of the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion gene in leukaemia initiation, additional genetic lesions are required for disease development. Here we identify recurring ZBTB7A mutations in 23% (13/56) of AML t(8;21) patients, including missense and truncating mutations resulting in alteration or loss of the C-terminal zinc-finger domain of ZBTB7A. The transcription factor ZBTB7A is important for haematopoietic lineage fate decisions and for regulation of glycolysis. On a functional level, we show that ZBTB7A mutations disrupt the transcriptional repressor potential and the anti-proliferative effect of ZBTB7A. The specific association of ZBTB7A mutations with t(8;21) rearranged AML points towards leukaemogenic cooperativity between mutant ZBTB7A and the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion.","['Hartmann, Luise', 'Dutta,

Recent therapeutic approaches aim to mimic RAS extinction by interfering with critical signaling pathways downstream of the mutant protein. This study investigates the phosphoproteome of primary human melanocytes bearing mutations in the two hot spots of NRAS, NRAS(G12) and NRAS(Q61). Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture followed by mass spectrometry identified 14,155 spectra of 3,371 unique phosphopeptides mapping to 1,159 proteins (false discovery rate < 2%). Data revealed pronounced PI3K/AKT signaling in NRAS(G12V) mutant cells and pronounced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in NRAS(Q61L) variants. Computer-based prediction models for kinases involved, revealed that CK2alpha is significantly overrepresented in primary human melanocytes bearing NRAS(Q61L) mutations. Similar differences were found in human NRAS(Q61) mutant melanoma cell lines that were also more sensitive to pharmacologic CK2alpha inhibition compared with NRAS(G12) mutant cells. Furthermore, CK2alpha levels were pronounced in patient samples of NRAS(Q61) mutant melanoma at the mRNA and protein level. The preclinical findings of this study reveal that codon 12 and 61 mutant NRAS cells have distinct signaling characteristics that could allow for the development of more effective, mutation-specific treatment modalities.","['Posch, Christian', 'Sanlorenzo, Martina', 'Vujic, Igor', 'Oses-Prieto, Juan A', 'Cholewa, Brian D', 'Kim, Sarasa T', 'Ma, Jeffrey', 'Lai, Kevin', 'Zekhtser, Mitchell', 'Esteve-Puig, Rosaura', 'Green, Gary', 'Chand, Shreya', 'Burlingame, Alma L', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Renate', 'Rappersberger, Klemens', 'Ortiz-Urda, Susana']","['Posch C', 'Sanlorenzo M', 'Vujic I', 'Oses-Prieto JA', 'Cholewa BD', 'Kim ST', 'Ma J', 'Lai K', 'Zekhtser M', 'Esteve-Puig R', 'Green G', 'Chand S', 'Burlingame AL', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Rappersberger K', 'Ortiz-Urda S']","[""Department of Dermatology, Mt.

Prolonged and profound neutropenia in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia and stem cell transplantation is a major risk factor for IA. Allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients with graft-versus-host disease and corticosteroid use are also at high risk. Management in a protective environment with high efficiency particular air (HEPA) filter is generally recommended to prevent aspergillosis in patients with prolonged and profound neutropenia. Antifungal prophylaxis against Aspergillus species should be considered in patients with past history of aspergillosis or colonization of Aspergillus species, at facilities with high incidence of IA and those without a protective environment. Early diagnosis and prompt antifungal treatment is important to improve outcome. Imaging studies such as computed tomography and biomarkers such as galactomannan antigen and beta-D-glucan are useful for early diagnosis. Empirical antifungal treatment based on persistent or recurrent fever during neutropenia despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is generally recommended in high-risk patients. Alternatively, a preemptive treatment strategy has recently been proposed in the context of progress in the early diagnosis of IA based on the results of imaging studies and biomarkers. Voriconazole is recommended for initial therapy for IA. Liposomal amphotericin B is considered as alternative initial therapy. Combination antifungal therapy of echinocandin with voriconazole or liposomal amphotericin B could be a choice for refractory cases.","['Kimura, Shun-Ichi']",['Kimura S'],"['Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Med Mycol J,Medical mycology journal,101562838,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/administration & dosage', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Aspergillosis/*complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Echinocandins/administration & dosage', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Opportunistic Infections/*complications/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Voriconazole/administration & dosage']",,,2016/06/03 06:00,2017/06/09 06:00,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3314/mmj.57.J77 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Mycol J. 2016;57(2):J77-88. doi: 10.3314/mmj.57.J77.,10.3314/mmj.57.J77 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a 67-year-old man with localized cutaneous fusariosis of the scrotum, as a complication of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) under chemotherapy. An induration of 25 mm in diameter, which was covered by necrosis and black crust and with pain upon pressure, was found on the scrotum. Direct microscopic examination of the necrosis showed numerous fungal elements. Culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar with cycloheximide yielded a floccose, grayish white colony. Microscopically, crescent-shaped macroconidia and oval microconidia were abundant. The fungus was identified using gene analysis as Fusarium falciforme of the Fusarium solani species complex. The lesion was treated by voriconazole (total dose: 66,180 mg) and was reduced to 15 mm in diameter. Other metastatic lesions did not appear. After 4 months from the first visit to our department, the patient died of AML. It is believed that the treatment in the early stage of infection prevented further extension of the lesion. During examination of necrotic lesions occurring on the skin of patients with hematological malignancies, it is important to include mycological examination for opportunistic fungal infections, such as aspergillosis or fusariosis, which are easily overlooked by routine culture methods using conventional media with cycloheximide.

Large population influxes into previously isolated rural areas may foster localised epidemics of the postulated infection causing a subsequent increase of CL. While marked population growth after a period of stability was central to the formulation of the hypothesis and to the early studies on population mixing, there is a lack of objective criteria to define such growth patterns. We aimed to determine whether periods of marked population growth coincided with increases in the risk of CL in Swiss municipalities. We identified incident cases of CL aged 0-15 years for the period 1985-2010 from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. Annual data on population counts in Swiss municipalities were obtained for 1980-2010. As exposures, we defined (1) cumulative population growth during a 5-year moving time window centred on each year (1985-2010) and (2) periods of 'take-off growth' identified by segmented linear regression. We compared CL incidence across exposure categories using Poisson regression and tested for effect modification by degree of urbanisation. Our study included 1500 incident cases and 2561 municipalities. The incident rate ratio (IRR) comparing the highest to the lowest quintile of 5-year population growth was 1.18 (95 % CI 0.96, 1.46) in all municipalities and 1.33 (95 % CI 0.93, 1.92) in rural municipalities (p value interaction 0.36). In municipalities with take-off growth, the IRR comparing the take-off period (>6 % annual population growth) with the initial period of low or negative growth (<2 %) was 2.07 (95 % CI 0.95, 4.51) overall and 2.99 (1.11, 8.05) in rural areas (p interaction 0.52). Our study provides further support for the population mixing hypothesis and underlines the need to distinguish take-off growth from other growth patterns in future research.","['Lupatsch, Judith E', 'Kreis, Christian', 'Zwahlen, Marcel', 'Niggli, Felix', 'Ammann, Roland A', 'Kuehni, Claudia E', 'Spycher, Ben D']","['Lupatsch JE', 'Kreis C', 'Zwahlen M', 'Niggli F', 'Ammann RA', 'Kuehni CE', 'Spycher BD']","['Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', ""University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. ben.spycher@ispm.unibe.ch.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160601,Netherlands,Eur J Epidemiol,European journal of epidemiology,8508062,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cities/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Population Growth', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural Population', 'Switzerland/epidemiology', 'Time', 'Urban Population/*statistics & numerical data', '*Urbanization']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Childhood cancer', '*Infections', '*Leukaemia', '*Population mixing', '*Take-off growth']",2016/06/03 06:00,2018/01/30 06:00,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10654-016-0162-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s10654-016-0162-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Epidemiol. 2016 Aug;31(8):763-74. doi: 10.1007/s10654-016-0162-6.

It is hence of no surprise that when DNA methylation mechanisms are disrupted by intrinsic or extrinsic causes, the likelihood of tumourigenesis increases. Both hypermethylation and hypomethylation may predispose to cancer formation through aberrant inhibition or expression of particular genes and this is seen in different types of cancers, such as laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and acute myeloid leukaemia. By increasing our knowledge and understanding of these epigenetic mechanisms, we will be able to develop diagnostic techniques such as methylation profiling, to screen for and detect aberrant methylation patterns which may predispose to cancer formation in our patients. This would enable early diagnosis and treatment which may also involve the use of drugs developed to provide directed epigenetic therapy, shifting away from the current trend which involves the use of radical anti-cancer therapy. These diagnostic and treatment options may be the future of cancer management.","['Maresca, G', 'Wismayer, P S']","['Maresca G', 'Wismayer PS']","['University of Malta Medical School, Mater Dei Hospital Msida, Malta, Europe.', 'Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Biomedical Sciences Building, University of Malta, Msida, Malta, Europe.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Kuwait,Gulf J Oncolog,The Gulf journal of oncology,101500911,,IM,"['*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'DNA Methylation', 'Epigenetic therapy', 'Epigenetics', 'methylation profiling.']",2016/06/03 06:00,2018/09/21 06:00,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Gulf J Oncolog. 2016 May;1(21):77-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because anti-HTLV-1 immune responses are critical for suppressing infected cells, enhancing cellular immunity is beneficial for the treatment of HTLV-1-associated diseases. Using simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1) infected Japanese macaques, we analyzed the immune responses to viral antigens and the dynamics of virus-infected cells. The chemokine receptor CCR4 is expressed on STLV-1 infected cells, and administration of humanized monoclonal antibody to CCR4, mogamulizumab, dramatically decreased the number of STLV-1-infected cells in vivo. Concurrently, mogamulizumab treatment enhanced STLV-1 specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses by simultaneously targeting CCR4(+) effector regulatory T (Treg) cells and infected cells. Mogamulizumab promoted the phagocytosis of CCR4(+) infected cells by macrophages, which likely enhanced antigen presentation. Vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) expressing viral antigens suppressed the proviral load and the number of Tax-expressing cells. Enhanced T-cell responses were also observed in some ATL patients who were treated with mogamulizumab. This study shows that mogamulizumab works not only by killing CCR4(+) infected cells directly, but also by enhancing T cell responses by increasing the phagocytosis of infected cells by antigen-presenting cells and suppressing CCR4(+) effector Treg cells.","['Sugata, Kenji', 'Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Miura, Michi', 'Akari, Hirofumi', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Nosaka, Kisato', 'Watanabe, Yuko', 'Suzushima, Hitoshi', 'Koh, Ki-Ryang', 'Nakagawa, Masanori', 'Kohara, Michinori', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Sugata K', 'Yasunaga J', 'Miura M', 'Akari H', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Nosaka K', 'Watanabe Y', 'Suzushima H', 'Koh KR', 'Nakagawa M', 'Kohara M', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Evolutional Virology, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto Shinto General Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kumamoto Shinto General Hospital, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka General Hospital of West Japan Railway Company, Osaka, Japan.', 'North Medical Center, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Yosano-cho, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160602,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', 'YI437801BE (mogamulizumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Viral/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*drug therapy/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Macaca/immunology/virology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, CCR4/*metabolism', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/metabolism', 'Viral Load/drug effects']",,,2016/06/03 06:00,2018/04/27 06:00,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['srep27150 [pii]', '10.1038/srep27150 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Jun 2;6:27150. doi: 10.1038/srep27150.,10.1038/srep27150 [doi],,PMC4890010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We know little about subjective work outcomes and how cancer survivors perceive being returned to work. Therefore, we developed the Quality of Working Life Questionnaire for Cancer Survivors (QWLQ-CS). Our aim was to pre-test the items of the initial QWLQ-CS on acceptability and comprehensiveness. In addition, item retention was performed by pre-assessing the relevance scores and response distributions of the items in the QWLQ-CS. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted after cancer survivors, who had returned to work, filled in the 102 items of the QWLQ-CS. To improve acceptability and comprehensiveness, the semi-structured interview inquired about items that were annoying, difficult, confusing, twofold or redundant. If cancer survivors had difficulty explaining their opinion or emotion about an item, the interviewer used verbal probing technique to investigate the cancer survivor's underlying thoughts. The cancer survivors' comments on the items were analysed, and items were revised accordingly. Decisions on item retention regarding the relevance of items and the response distributions were made by means of pre-set decision rules. RESULTS: The 19 cancer survivors (53 % male) had a mean age of 51 +/- 11 years old. They were diagnosed between 2009 and 2013 with lymphoma, leukaemia, prostate cancer, breast cancer, or colon cancer. Acceptability of the QWLQ-CS was good - none of the items were annoying - but 73 items were considered difficult, confusing, twofold or redundant. To improve acceptability, for instance, the authors replaced the phrase 'disease' with 'health situation' in several items. Consequently, comprehensiveness was improved by the authors rephrasing and adjusting items by adding clarifying words, such as 'in the work situation'. The pre-assessment of the relevance scores resulted in a sufficient number of cancer survivors indicating the items as relevant to their quality of working life, and no evident indication for uneven response distributions. Therefore, all items were retained. CONCLUSIONS: The 104 items of the preliminary QWLQ-CS were found relevant, acceptable and comprehensible by cancer survivors who have returned to work. The QWLQ-CS is now suitable for larger sample sizes of cancer survivors, which is necessary to test the psychometric properties of this questionnaire.","['de Jong, Merel', 'Tamminga, Sietske J', 'de Boer, Angela G E M', 'Frings-Dresen, Monique H W']","['de Jong M', 'Tamminga SJ', 'de Boer AG', 'Frings-Dresen MH']","['Coronel Institute of Occupational Health, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, P.O.

Besides, upregulation of cellular autophagic responses is considered a contributing factor for MDR in cancer cells. We designed a liposome system co-encapsulating a chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin hydrochloride, DOX) and a typical autophagy inhibitior (chloroquine phosphate, CQ) at a weight ratio of 1:2 and investigated its drug resistance reversal mechanism. MTT assay showed that the IC50 of DOX/CQ co-encapsulated liposome in DOX-resistant human breast cancer cells (MCF7/ADR) was 4.7 +/- 0.2 muM, 5.7-fold less than that of free DOX (26.9 +/- 1.9 muM), whereas it was 19.5-fold in doxorubicin-resistant human acute myelocytic leukemia cancer cells (HL60/ADR) (DOX/CQ co-encapsulated liposome 1.2 +/- 0.1 muM, free DOX 23.4 +/- 2.8 muM). The cellular uptake of DOX increased upon addition of free CQ, indicating that CQ may interact with P-gp and MRP1; however, the expressions of P-gp and MRP1 remained unchanged. In contrast, the expression of the autophagy-related protein LC3-II increased remarkably. Therefore, the mechanism of MDR reversal may be closely related to autophagic inhibition. Evaluation of anti-tumor activity was achieved in an MCF-7/ADR multicellular tumor spheroid model and transgenic zebrafish model. DOX/CQ co-encapsulated liposome exerted a better anti-tumor effect in both models than that of liposomal DOX or DOX alone. These findings suggest that encapsulating CQ with DOX in liposomes significantly improves the sensitivity of DOX in DOX-resistant cancer cells.","['Gao, Menghua', 'Xu, Yuzhen', 'Qiu, Liyan']","['Gao M', 'Xu Y', 'Qiu L']","['b College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , China.', 'b College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , China.', 'a Ministry of Education (MOE) Key Laboratory of Synthesis and Functionalization, Department of Polymer Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , China and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160602,England,J Liposome Res,Journal of liposome research,9001952,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chloroquine/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Liposomes/chemistry', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Particle Size', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface Properties', 'Zebrafish']",['NOTNLM'],"['Autophagy', 'chloroquine', 'doxorubicin', 'liposome', 'multidrug resistance']",2016/06/03 06:00,2017/05/02 06:00,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08982104.2016.1185731 [doi]'],ppublish,J Liposome Res. 2017 Jun;27(2):151-160. doi: 10.1080/08982104.2016.1185731.

Methods We retrospectively analyzed 14 patients with aggressive ATL who had been treated at our institution with weekly cycles of mogamulizumab for eight weeks from 2012-2014. Results The patients (median age: 63 years old) were classified as having acute- (n=10) or lymphoma-type (n=4) ATL. The prior treatment regimens consisted of CHOP, VCAP-AMP-VECP, DeVIC and CHASE, with an average of two courses (range: 1-4). The prior disease responses were partial remission (n=3) and progressive disease (n=11). The treatment was administered in the primary refractory setting (n=8), for relapse (n=2), or as bridging therapy before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (n=4). The overall response rates were 64% and 43% after four and eight cycles (or after the final cycles), respectively. The median overall survival (OS), OS rate at six months and OS rate at 12 months were 66 days, 41.7% and 20.8%, respectively. All of the patients with acute-type ATL who showed a response to treatment had an early response. Notably, six of the 14 ATL patients showed somewhat prolonged survival (>100 days). However, relapse or disease progression in the peripheral blood, central nervous system, lymph nodes, skin, and/or bone occurred within a relatively short period after treatment. The adverse effects were tolerable, and included lymphopenia, cytomegalovirus infection and skin rash. Conclusion Mogamulizumab therapy resulted in an early and high remission rate and somewhat prolonged survival in patients with refractory ATL. However, the duration of remission was short, and there was early relapse and disease progression. This study may show the current impact of mogamulizumab in clinical practice.","['Kawano, Noriaki', 'Kuriyama, Takuro', 'Sonoda, Koh-Hei', 'Yoshida, Shuro', 'Yamashita, Kiyoshi', 'Ochiai, Hidenobu', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Ishikawa, Fumihiko', 'Ueda, Akira', 'Kikuchi, Ikuo']","['Kawano N', 'Kuriyama T', 'Sonoda KH', 'Yoshida S', 'Yamashita K', 'Ochiai H', 'Shimoda K', 'Ishikawa F', 'Ueda A', 'Kikuchi I']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160601,Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', 'YI437801BE (mogamulizumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,,2016/06/03 06:00,2017/03/28 06:00,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2169/internalmedicine.55.6312 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med. 2016;55(11):1439-45. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.55.6312.

In the last decade, reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have been developed with the aim of reducing NRM and allowing older patients and those with medical comorbidities to benefit from UCBT. The aim of the current retrospective study was to compare transplantation outcomes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients given UCBT after either RIC or MAC. Data from 894 adults with AML receiving a single or double UCBT as first allograft from 2004 to 2013 at EBMT centers were included in this study. 415 patients were given UCBT after RIC while 479 patients following a MAC. In comparison to MAC recipients, RIC recipients had a similar incidence of neutrophil engraftment and of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, RIC recipients had a higher incidence of disease relapse and a lower NRM, translating to comparable leukemia-free (LFS), GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) and overall survival (OS). These observations remained qualitatively similar after adjusting for differences between groups in multivariate analyses. In conclusion, these data suggest that LFS and OS are similar with RIC or with MAC in adults AML patients transplanted with UCBT. These observations could serve as basis for a future prospective randomized study.","['Baron, Frederic', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Beohou, Eric', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Gluckman, Eliane', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Baron F', 'Ruggeri A', 'Beohou E', 'Labopin M', 'Sanz G', 'Milpied N', 'Michallet M', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Blaise D', 'Sierra J', 'Socie G', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Schmid C', 'Giebel S', 'Gorin NC', 'Esteve J', 'Ciceri F', 'Savani BN', 'Mohty M', 'Gluckman E', 'Nagler A']","['University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Eurocord, Hospital Saint Louis, AP-HP, and IUH University Paris VII, Paris, France.', 'AP-HP, Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'EBMT Paris Office, Hospital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.', 'EBMT Paris Office, Hospital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Hospital Universitario La Fe, Servicio de Hematologia, Valencia, Spain.', 'CHU Bordeaux, Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire-Hopital Haut-leveque, Bordeaux, France.', 'University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', ""Service d' Hematologie du Centre Hospitalier de Lyon Sud, Pierre-Benite, France."", 'Ospedale San Martino, Department of Haematology II, Genova, Italy.', 'Institut Paoli Calmettes (IPC), Aix Marseille University (AMU), UM105, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie (CRCM), Inserm U1068, CNRS UMR7258 Marseille, Marseille, France.', 'Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Hematology Department, Barcelona, Spain.', 'AP-HP, Hematology Transplantation, Hospital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Erasmus Medical Center-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Klinikum Augsburg, Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Munich, Augsburg, Germany.', 'Maria Sklodowska-Curie Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, Gliwice, Poland.', 'AP-HP, Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'EBMT Paris Office, Hospital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Deptartment of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Ospedale San Raffaele, Universita degli Studi, Milano, Italy.', 'Long Term Transplant Clinic, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'AP-HP, Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre & Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'INSERM, UMRS 938, Paris, France.', 'Eurocord, Hospital Saint Louis, AP-HP, and IUH University Paris VII, France Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Monaco.', 'EBMT Paris Office, Hospital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Ramat-Gan, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Research Report', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'myeloablative', 'reduced-intensity', 'transplantation', 'unrelated cord blood']",2016/06/03 06:00,2018/01/10 06:00,['2016/06/03 06:00'],"['2016/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['9599 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9599 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 12;7(28):43027-43038. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9599.,10.18632/oncotarget.9599 [doi],,PMC5190005,['CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This disease has traditionally been treated using cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens in combination with anti-CD20 antibody treatment, and recent long-term follow-up data from multiple centers suggest that fit patients with CLL with favorable disease features-particularly mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) genes-derive very long-term benefit from the most potent of these regimens, namely the fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) regimen. The advent of oral targeted therapies, particularly ibrutinib and idelalisib, has provided generally well-tolerated and highly effective additional options that have come into widespread use in the relapsed setting. Additional agents are advancing in clinical development, with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax likely to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016. With the development of these novel therapies for patients with relapsed CLL, many unanswered questions remain, including the optimal sequence (first vs. second line), duration, discontinuation, and combination of these agents. In addition, recent publications show the emergence of a pattern of treatment resistance in certain subgroups of patients with del(17p) and complex karyotype that needs further study and improvement. Because the field of CLL management has become much more complex, we focus here on understanding the recent data and discuss many of the questions and controversies important for how we approach patients with CLL.","['Brown, Jennifer R', 'Hallek, Michael J', 'Pagel, John M']","['Brown JR', 'Hallek MJ', 'Pagel JM']","['From the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, WA.', 'From the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, WA.', 'From the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, WA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

Although an increase in biologic understanding of MDS has led to improved patient risk stratification and prognostication, advances in treatment have lagged behind. While hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative option for some, most affected patients continue to be treated with supportive care or with drugs that offer temporary palliation such as hematopoietic growth factors, DNA hypomethylating agents, or immunomodulatory therapy. For several groups, such as those with intermediate-risk disease as classified by the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) or those with higher-risk disease for whom hypomethylating agents have failed, optimal treatment remains uncertain. Inclusion of patient-related factors such as frailty and comorbid conditions into risk assessment can improve prognostication beyond the disease-associated variables included in systems such as the IPSS-R.

In this article, we highlight advances in the genetics and therapy of three key subtypes of ALL: T-cell ALL, BCR-ABL1 (Philadelphia [Ph] chromosone-positive), and Ph-like ALL. T-ALL is an aggressive disease that accounts for about 15% and 25% of ALL among pediatric and adult cohorts, respectively, and exhibits a multistep nature of cancer initiation and progression. The integration of cytogenetics, molecular biology, and immunophenotype analyses has led to the identification of defined T-ALL subgroups, such as early T-cell precursor ALL and novel lesions with a prognostic role, for which specific inhibitors are being developed. Ph-positive ALL was historically regarded as a subtype of ALL with a poor prognosis, and allogeneic stem cell transplant was recommended for all patients who could undergo this procedure. The deep complete responses seen with combination tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and chemotherapy in Ph-positive ALL, and the reports of long-term survival among some patients not undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant, has raised the question of whether there is a subset of patients who could be cured without this intervention. Ph-like ALL is a subtype of B-progenitor ALL common among older children and adults and associated with a diverse range of genetic alterations that activate kinase signaling. Ph-like ALL is also associated with poor outcome, for which precision medicine trials identifying kinase alterations and testing TKI therapy are being developed.","['Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Gianfelici, Valentina', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Chiaretti S', 'Gianfelici V', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Mullighan CG']","[""From the Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy; Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA; Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""From the Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy; Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA; Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""From the Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy; Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA; Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""From the Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy; Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA; Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

Systemic combination chemotherapy with an anthracycline and cytarabine remains the standard induction regimen for ""fit"" adults. Patients who achieve complete remission generally receive postinduction therapy with cytarabine-based chemotherapy or an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Those unfit for induction chemotherapy are treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), low-dose cytarabine, or they are offered supportive care alone with transfusions and prophylactic antimicrobials. The revolution in understanding the genetics of AML, facilitated by next-generation sequencing, has led to many new drugs against driver mutations. Better methods of identification of leukemic blasts have provided us with better means to detect the disease left behind after cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. This measurable residual disease has been correlated with poorer relapse-free survival, demonstrating the need for novel strategies to eradicate it to improve the outcome of patients with acute leukemias.

In this study, we analyzed the effect of MEK inhibitor CI-1040 on the survival of AML cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using ELISA and MTT we studied the cytotoxic effects of CI-1040 on AML U-937 cells. We studied the changes induced by CI-1040 on PUMA and p53 expression in U-937 cells by Western blotting assay. Moreover, we analyzed the cytotoxic effect of CI-1040 in U-937 cells with deleted PUMA, wt-p53 by wt-p53 siRNA and PUMA siRNA transfection. RESULTS: CI-1040 induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation in U-937 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. CI-1040 induced a significant increase in PUMA mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, we show that knockdown of PUMA by PUMA siRNA transfection inhibited CI-1040-induced apoptosis and proliferation inhibition in U-937 cells. Moreover, CI-1040 induced apoptosis and proliferation inhibition was irrespective of wt-P53 status. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that CI-1040 induce apoptosis of U-937 cells and might be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of AML.","['Wei, C-R', 'Ge, X-F', 'Wang, Y', 'Li, X-R']","['Wei CR', 'Ge XF', 'Wang Y', 'Li XR']","[""Department of Haematology, People's Hospital of Linyi, Linyi, Shandong, China. yangxinghuakq@gmail.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Benzamides)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2016/06/02 06:00,2017/08/22 06:00,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2016 May;20(10):1961-8.,10818 [pii],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, High dose MTX has been proven to cause substantial toxicity and have high intra-and inter-patient variability. Population pharmacokinetic analysis is a useful tool for identification of sources of pharmacokinetic variability during anticancer drug development and can aid the design of alternative dosing regimens to enhance their efficacy and safety. AIM: The aim of our study is to developed and validate a population pharmacokinetics model of our population. We hereby describe the clinical covariates (age, sex and clearance of the creatinine) that influence MTX pharmacokinetic for predicting optimal dose to reduce MTX toxicity. METHOD: It is a prospective study achieved between January 2005 to January 2012 in the Service of Clinical Pharmacology. Including 273 patients treated for acute lymphocytic leukaemia 2582 plasma concentration was achieved. The data have been analyzed with Nonmem(c) software (non linear regression to mixed effect). RESULTS: The age of our patients varied from 2 to 23 years with an average of 13 years. The patients received high dose MTX therapy (1 to 8 g/m2) in 24 hours infusion every 15 days. Three compartiment models describe the pharmacokinetic of MTX. The most important covariables affecting the model were clearance of the creatinine, age and weight. We obtained a good correlation between the predicted and the observed concentrations. CONCLUSION: The development of population pharmacokinetics model of MTX allows us to propose a therapeutic diagram adapted to every patient according to its morphological and pharmacological features while taking in consideration the therapeutic objective.","['Jebabli, Nadia', 'Gaies, Emna', 'El Jebari, Hanen', 'Charfi, Rim', 'Lakhal, Mohamed', 'Klouz, Anis', 'Salouage, Issam', 'Trabelsi, Sameh']","['Jebabli N', 'Gaies E', 'El Jebari H', 'Charfi R', 'Lakhal M', 'Klouz A', 'Salouage I', 'Trabelsi S']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Tunisia,Tunis Med,La Tunisie medicale,0413766,,IM,,,,2016/06/02 06:00,2016/06/02 06:01,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:01 [medline]']",['/article-medicale-tunisie.php?article=2948 [pii]'],ppublish,Tunis Med. 2015 Dec;93(12):760-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Familial forms of MDS have traditionally been considered rare, especially in adults; however, the increasing availability of somatic and germline genetic analyses has identified multiple susceptibility loci. Bone marrow failure syndromes have been well-described in the pediatric setting, e.g., Fanconi anemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita (DC), Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SBS), hallmarked by clinically-recognizable phenotypes (e.g., radial ray anomalies in FA) and significantly increased risks for MDS and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the setting of bone marrow failure. However, additional families with multiple cases of MDS or AML have long been reported in the medical literature with little known regarding potential hereditary etiologies. Over the last decade, genomic investigation of such families has revealed multiple genes conferring inherited risks for MDS and/or AML as the primary malignancy, including RUNX1, ANKRD26, DDX41, ETV6, GATA2, and SRP72. As these syndromes are increasingly appreciated in even apparently de novo presentations of MDS, it is important for hematologists/oncologists to become familiar with these newly-described syndromes. Herein, we provide a review of familial MDS syndromes and practical aspects of management in patients with predisposition syndromes.","['Bannon, Sarah A', 'DiNardo, Courtney D']","['Bannon SA', 'DiNardo CD']","['Department of Clinical Cancer Genetics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA. sabannon@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030, USA. cdinardo@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160530,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (ANKRD26 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SRP72 protein, human)', '0 (Signal Recognition Particle)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX41 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)', 'Bone Marrow failure syndromes']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Failure Disorders', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/genetics', 'Female', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genetic Testing', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*genetics', 'Heredity', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Signal Recognition Particle/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['MDS', 'familial', 'genetic counseling', 'germline', 'hereditary', 'predisposition']",2016/06/02 06:00,2017/03/17 06:00,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2016/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms17060838 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms17060838 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2016 May 30;17(6). pii: ijms17060838. doi: 10.3390/ijms17060838.,10.3390/ijms17060838 [doi] E838 [pii],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4926372,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) present with very heterogeneous disease characteristics translating into highly differential risk properties. To meet the urgent need for refinement in risk stratification at diagnosis and the search for novel therapies we studied CNR expression and response to cannabinoid treatment in CLL. Expression levels of CNR1&2 were determined in 107 CLL patients by real-time PCR and analyzed with regard to prognostic markers and survival. Cell viability of primary CLL cells was determined in suspension and co-culture after incubation in increasing cannabinoid concentrations under normal and reduced serum conditions and in combination with fludarabine. Impact of cannabinoids on migration of CLL cells towards CXCL12 was determined in transwell plates. We found CNR1&2 to be overexpressed in CLL compared to healthy B-cells. Discriminating between high and low expressing subgroups, only high CNR1 expression was associated with two established high risk markers and conferred significantly shorter overall and treatment free survival. Viability of CLL primary cells was reduced in a dose dependent fashion upon incubation with cannabinoids, however, healthy cells were similarly affected. Under serum reduced conditions, no significant differences were observed within suspension and co-culture, respectively, however, the feeder layer contributed significantly to the survival of CLL cells compared to suspension culture conditions. No significant differences were observed when treating CLL cells with cannabinoids in combination with fludarabine. Interestingly, biologic activity of cannabinoids was independent of both CNR1&2 expression. Finally, we did not observe an inhibition of CXCL12-induced migration by cannabinoids. In contrast to other tumor entities, our data suggest a limited usability of cannabinoids for CLL therapy. Nonetheless, we could define CNR1 mRNA expression as novel prognostic marker.","['Freund, Patricia', 'Porpaczy, Edit A', 'Le, Trang', 'Gruber, Michaela', 'Pausz, Clemens', 'Staber, Philipp', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'Vanura, Katrina']","['Freund P', 'Porpaczy EA', 'Le T', 'Gruber M', 'Pausz C', 'Staber P', 'Jager U', 'Vanura K']","['Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160601,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cannabinoid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Cannabinoid/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2016/06/02 06:00,2017/07/19 06:00,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2015/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0156693 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-37997 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jun 1;11(6):e0156693. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0156693. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0156693 [doi],,PMC4889125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since previous studies identified a CD33 splice variant missing exon 2 (CD33E2) and, consequently, the immune-dominant membrane-distal V-set domain, we investigated the expression and functional characteristics of CD33 transcript variants in AML. In primary AML specimens, we not only found full-length CD33 (CD33FL) and CD33E2 but also corresponding variants containing an alternate exon 7 predicted to encode a CD33 protein lacking most of the intracellular domain (CD33E7a and, not previously described, CD33E2,E7a) in almost all cases. In acute leukemia cell sublines engineered to express individual CD33 splice variants, all splice variants had endocytic properties. CD33FL and CD33E7a mediated similar degrees of GO cytotoxicity, whereas CD33E2 and CD33E2,E7a could not serve as target for GO. Co-expression of CD33E2 did not interfere with CD33FL endocytosis and did not impact CD33FL-mediated GO cytotoxicity. Together, our findings document a greater-than-previously thought complexity of CD33 expression in human AML. They identify CD33 variants that lack exon 2 and are not recognized by current CD33-directed therapeutics as potential target for future unconjugated or conjugated antibodies.","['Laszlo, George S', 'Harrington, Kimberly H', 'Gudgeon, Chelsea J', 'Beddoe, Mary E', 'Fitzgibbon, Matthew P', 'Ries, Rhonda E', 'Lamba, Jatinder K', 'McIntosh, Martin W', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Laszlo GS', 'Harrington KH', 'Gudgeon CJ', 'Beddoe ME', 'Fitzgibbon MP', 'Ries RE', 'Lamba JK', 'McIntosh MW', 'Meshinchi S', 'Walter RB']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Arcadia, CA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Aminoglycosides/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Endocytosis', 'Exons/*genetics', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Immunotoxins/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Protein Isoforms/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome']",['NOTNLM'],"['CD33', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'antigen', 'immunotherapy', 'splice variants']",2016/06/02 06:00,2017/12/30 06:00,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2016/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['9674 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9674 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 12;7(28):43281-43294. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9674.,10.18632/oncotarget.9674 [doi],"['P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA176270/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK056465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 OD020069/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5190023,"['R.B.W. has received research funding from Amgen, Inc., Amphivena Therapeutics,', 'Inc., Covagen AG, Emergent Biosolutions, Inc., Pfizer, Inc., and Seattle', 'Genetics, Inc and Seattle Genetics, Inc., and is a consultant for Amphivena', 'Therapeutics, Inc, and Covagen AG.

However, the functions of integrin in AML are needed to be clarified. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were retrieved and integrin beta3 (ITGB3) expression and prognostic significance for AML were analyzed. Integrin alphavbeta3 (alphavbeta3) in sorafenib sensitivity and signaling pathway of FLT3-ITD AML cells was evaluated in vitro. The level of ITGB3 expression was positively correlated with risk stratification and prognosis of AML patients, especially in cytogenetic-normal patients with Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutation. Integrin alphavbeta3 decreased sorafenib sensitivity when co-culture of MV4-11 cells and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), and it is crucial for osteopontin (OPN) induced sorafenib insensitivity in FLT3-ITD mutated AML cells. Mechanically, alphavbeta3 enhance beta-catenin activation through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3beta) pathway. Moreover, genetic inhibition of beta-catenin by shRNA could increase sorafenib sensitivity in MV4-11 cells. Taken together, our study revealed a novel mechanism in microenvironment influence on sorafenib sensitivity in AML with FLT3-ITD mutation that was caused by activating integrin alphavbeta3/PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta/beta-catenin pathway. Integrin alphavbeta3/beta-catenin could be considered as a new therapeutic target for AML especially for FLT3-ITD mutated AML.","['Yi, Hai', 'Zeng, Dongfeng', 'Shen, Zhaohua', 'Liao, Jun', 'Wang, Xiaoguo', 'Liu, Yao', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Kong, Peiyan']","['Yi H', 'Zeng D', 'Shen Z', 'Liao J', 'Wang X', 'Liu Y', 'Zhang X', 'Kong P']","[""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Chengdu Military Region, Chengdu, 610083, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alphaVbeta3)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (SPP1 protein, human)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaVbeta3/*metabolism', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Osteopontin/metabolism', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorafenib', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 internal tandem duplication', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'drug sensitivity', 'integrin', 'beta-catenin']",2016/10/27 06:00,2018/01/18 06:00,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2015/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['9617 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9617 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 28;7(26):40387-40397. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9617.,10.18632/oncotarget.9617 [doi],,PMC5130015,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) can be measured on an International Scale (IS), this has not become fully universal. By using a WHO international standard panel established for calibrating secondary standards based on the IS, we have previously developed an RT-qPCR kit, ODK-1201, for quantification of major BCR-ABL1. RESULTS: In this study, the reliability of kit-specific conversion factor 1.12 was validated by exchanging patients' samples between three local clinical laboratories and a reference laboratory. The mean bias of the local method after IS conversion was 1.6 fold lower than the reference method. The clinically-useful sensitivity of the kit was further evaluated for monitoring patients with deep molecular response. Based on the correlation of the IS values between ODK-1201 and the reference laboratory method, the detection level of the kit was estimated as 0.0032 % BCR-ABL1 (IS). CONCLUSIONS: ODK-1201 is a highly sensitive one-step RT-qPCR system for detecting BCR-ABL1 on the IS in 2 h after RNA extraction, thus contributing to standardization of molecular monitoring in CML.","['Yoshida, Chikashi', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Fletcher, Linda', 'Koga, Daisuke', 'Sogabe, Takayuki', 'Matsumura, Itaru', 'Kanakura, Yuzuru', 'Branford, Susan', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Yoshida C', 'Nakamae H', 'Fletcher L', 'Koga D', 'Sogabe T', 'Matsumura I', 'Kanakura Y', 'Branford S', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Mito Medical Center, 280, Sakuranosato, Ibarakimachi, Higashiibarakigun, Ibaraki, 311-3193 Japan.', 'Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Genetic and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Diagnostic Division, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Diagnostic Division, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Tokushima, Japan.', 'Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Genetic and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia ; School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia ; School of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia ; School of Molecular and Biomedical Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160510,Switzerland,Springerplus,SpringerPlus,101597967,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Conversion factor', 'International Scale', 'Real-time quantitative PCR']",2016/06/02 06:00,2016/06/02 06:01,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2016/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40064-016-2258-6 [doi]', '2258 [pii]']",epublish,Springerplus. 2016 May 10;5:569. doi: 10.1186/s40064-016-2258-6. eCollection 2016.,10.1186/s40064-016-2258-6 [doi],,PMC4864793,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) is the only curative option for adult patients with relapsed/refractory ALL, and achievement of CR is a crucial step before alloHSCT. Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE(R)) antibody construct with dual specificity for CD19 and CD3, simultaneously binding CD3-positive cytotoxic T cells and CD19-positive B cells, resulting in T-cell-mediated serial lysis of normal and malignant B cells. It recently gained accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL, based on a large phase II trial of 189 adults with relapsed/refractory B-ALL, which showed a CR/CRh (CR with partial hematologic recovery) of 43% after two cycles of treatment. Toxicities include cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events (encephalopathy, aphasia, and seizure). CRS can be alleviated by step-up dosing and dexamethasone, without affecting the cytotoxic effect of blinatumomab. The cause of neurologic toxicity is unclear but is also observed with other T-cell therapies and may relate to variable expression of CD19 within the brain. This review encompasses the preclinical rationale of using the BITE(R) class of compounds (blinatumomab being the only one that is FDA approved), with clinical data using blinatumomab in the relapsed/refractory setting (pediatrics and adults), the minimal residual disease setting (adults), as well as Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. The review also examines the main adverse events: their prevention, recognition, and management; possible mechanisms of resistance; causes of relapse.

Allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation (HCT) can improve overall survival (OS). However, myeloablative regimens can have unacceptably high transplant-related mortality (TRM) in an unselected group of older patients. Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) or nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning regimens preserve the graft-versus-leukemia effects but reduce TRM. NMA regimens result in minimal cytopenia and may not require stem cell support for restoring hematopoiesis. RIC regimens, intermediate in intensity between NMA and myeloablative regimens, can cause prolonged myelosuppresion and usually require stem cell support. A few retrospective and prospective studies suggest a possibility of lower risk of relapse with myeloablative HCT in fit older patients with lower HCT comorbidity index; however, RIC and NMA HCTs have an important role in less-fit patients and those with significant comorbidities because of lower TRM. Whether early tapering of immunosuppression, monitoring of minimal residual disease, and post-transplant maintenance therapy can improve the outcomes of RIC and NMA HCT in elderly patients will require prospective trials.","['Goyal, Gaurav', 'Gundabolu, Krishna', 'Vallabhajosyula, Saraschandra', 'Silberstein, Peter T', 'Bhatt, Vijaya Raj']","['Goyal G', 'Gundabolu K', 'Vallabhajosyula S', 'Silberstein PT', 'Bhatt VR']","['Creighton University Medical Center, 601 North 30th Street, Ste 5850, Omaha, NE 68131, USA.', 'University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'CHI Health Creighton University Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160422,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation', 'graft-versus-leukemia effect', 'myeloablative transplant', 'nonmyeloablative transplant', 'older patients', 'reduced intensity conditioning transplant']",2016/06/02 06:00,2016/06/02 06:01,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620716643493 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620716643493 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2016 Jun;7(3):131-41. doi: 10.1177/2040620716643493.

Despite its significance, a long-term future projection of cancer mortality has not been conducted; therefore, our objective was to estimate future cancer mortality in Korea by cancer site through 2032. The specially designed Nordpred software was used to estimate cancer mortality. The cancer death data from 1983 to 2012 and the population projection data from 1983 to 2032 were obtained from the Korean National Statistics Office. Based on our analysis, age-standardized rates with the world standard population of all cancer deaths were estimated to decline from 2008-2012 to 2028-2032 (men: -39.8%, women: -33.1%). However, the crude rates are predicted to rise (men: 29.8%, women: 24.4%), and the overall number of the cancer deaths is also estimated to increase (men: 35.5%, women: 32.3%). Several cancer deaths are projected to increase (lung, liver and gallbladder, colon and rectum, pancreas and leukemia in both sexes; prostate cancer in men; and breast and ovarian cancer in women), whereas other cancer deaths are expected to decrease (stomach, esophagus and larynx in both sexes and cervical cancer in women). The largest contribution to increasing cancer deaths is due to the aging of the Korean population. In conclusion, a strategy for primary prevention, early detection, and early treatment to cope with the rapidly increasing death of cancer due to population aging is urgently required.","['Son, Mia', 'Yun, Jae-Won']","['Son M', 'Yun JW']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Korea .', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Medicine, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, Korea .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160422,Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Republic of Korea', 'Survival Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['Korea', 'Mortality Forecasting', 'Neoplasms']",2016/06/02 06:00,2017/02/24 06:00,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2015/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3346/jkms.2016.31.6.892 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2016 Jun;31(6):892-901. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2016.31.6.892.

Studies of murine leukemia virus (MLV) revealed that the major host cell RNAs encapsidated by this simple retrovirus were LTR retrotransposons and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Several classes of ncRNAs appeared to be packaged by MLV shortly after synthesis, as precursors to tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, and small nucleolar RNAs were all enriched in virions. To determine the extent to which the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) packages similar RNAs, we used high-throughput sequencing to characterize the RNAs within infectious HIV-1 virions produced in CEM-SS T lymphoblastoid cells. We report that the most abundant cellular RNAs in HIV-1 virions are 7SL RNA and transcripts from numerous divergent and truncated members of the long interspersed element (LINE) and short interspersed element (SINE) families of retrotransposons. We also detected precursors to several tRNAs and small nuclear RNAs as well as transcripts derived from the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) intergenic spacers. We show that packaging of a pre-tRNA requires the nuclear export receptor Exportin 5, indicating that HIV-1 recruits at least some newly made ncRNAs in the cytoplasm. Together, our work identifies the set of RNAs packaged by HIV-1 and reveals that early steps in HIV-1 assembly intersect with host cell ncRNA biogenesis pathways.","['Eckwahl, Matthew J', 'Arnion, Helene', 'Kharytonchyk, Siarhei', 'Zang, Trinity', 'Bieniasz, Paul D', 'Telesnitsky, Alice', 'Wolin, Sandra L']","['Eckwahl MJ', 'Arnion H', 'Kharytonchyk S', 'Zang T', 'Bieniasz PD', 'Telesnitsky A', 'Wolin SL']","['Department of Cell Biology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06536, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06536, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.', 'Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10016, USA Laboratory of Retrovirology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10016, USA Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10016, USA.', 'Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10016, USA Laboratory of Retrovirology, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10016, USA Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10016, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06536, USA Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06536, USA Yale Cancer Center, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160531,United States,RNA,"RNA (New York, N.Y.)",9509184,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*noncoding RNA precursors', '*nuclear export', '*pre-tRNAs', '*retrotransposons', '*retrovirus']",2016/06/02 06:00,2017/07/07 06:00,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2016/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['rna.057299.116 [pii]', '10.1261/rna.057299.116 [doi]']",ppublish,RNA. 2016 Aug;22(8):1228-38. doi: 10.1261/rna.057299.116.

We have previously described the presence of Notch1 activating mutations and constitutive Notch1 signaling in patients with acute ATL. In this study, we report a high frequency of F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7)/hCDC4 mutations within the WD40 substrate-binding domain in 8 of 32 acute ATL patients (25%). Functionally, ATL FBXW7 mutants lost their ability to interact with intracellular Notch (NICD), resulting in increased protein stability and constitutive Notch1 signaling. Consistent with the loss-of-function found in ATL patients, expression of WT FBXW7 in several patient-derived ATL lines demonstrated strong tumor-suppressor activity characterized by reduced proliferation of ATL cells. Remarkably, two FBXW7 mutants, D510E and D527G, demonstrated oncogenic activity when expressed in the presence of HTLV-I Tax, mutated p53 R276H, or c-Myc F138C found in human cancers. Transforming activity was further demonstrated by the ability of the FBXW7 D510E mutant to provide IL-2-independent growth of Tax-immortalized human T cells and increase the tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model of ATL. This study suggests that FBXW7, normally a tumor suppressor, can act as an oncogene when mutated and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ATL.","['Yeh, Chien-Hung', 'Bellon, Marcia', 'Pancewicz-Wojtkiewicz, Joanna', 'Nicot, Christophe']","['Yeh CH', 'Bellon M', 'Pancewicz-Wojtkiewicz J', 'Nicot C']","['Department of Pathology, Center for Viral Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160.', 'Department of Pathology, Center for Viral Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160.', 'Department of Pathology, Center for Viral Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160.', 'Department of Pathology, Center for Viral Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160 cnicot@kumc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160531,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (IL2 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', '*Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*F-Box Proteins/metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Female', 'Heterografts', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/metabolism', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Protein Domains', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['FBXW7', 'HTLV', 'Notch', 'leukemia', 'oncogene']",2016/06/02 06:00,2017/01/27 06:00,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['1601537113 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1601537113 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Jun 14;113(24):6731-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1601537113.

METHODS: Sixty-eight reactive and 380 hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasms were immunohistochemically stained for syntaxin 7 (STX7), vesicle-associated membrane proteins (VAMP2, VAMP7, VAMP8), and synaptosomal-associated protein 23 (SNAP23). RESULTS: STX7 has potential for being a useful marker for distinguishing between normal B precursors (hematogones) vs B lymphoblasts, as well as between the ""popcorn"" cells of nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma vs the Reed-Sternberg cells of classic Hodgkin lymphoma or the B cells of T-cell, histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma. VAMP2 is uniquely expressed by both reactive and malignant plasma cells, in contrast to B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There is differential expression of SNARE proteins in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissue depending on lymphocyte maturation stage. CONCLUSIONS: Differential SNARE protein expression in the lymphoid system may have potential use in diagnosis and may offer clues to lymphoma biology.

The objective of the present study was to elucidate the clinical characteristics and prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia with associated DNA-methylation regulatory gene mutation. We studied 308 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. DNA-methylation regulatory gene mutations were observed in 135 of the 308 cases (43.8%). Acute myeloid leukemia associated with a DNA-methylation regulatory gene mutation was more frequent in older patients (P<0.0001) and in patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk (P<0.0001) accompanied by a high white blood cell count (P=0.0032).

Among the patients with DNA-methylation regulatory gene mutations, 26.7% were found to have two or more such mutations and prognosis worsened with increasing number of mutations. In multivariate analysis DNA-methylation regulatory gene mutation was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival (P=0.0424). However, patients with a DNA-methylation regulatory gene mutation who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation in first remission had a significantly better prognosis than those who did not undergo such transplantation (P=0.0254).

Single mismatched alleles were categorized into six HLA-A (A01, A01A03, A01A24, A02, A03, A24), six HLA-B (B07, B08, B27, B44, B58, B62), two HLA-C (C1, C2), and five HLA-DRB1 (DR1, DR3, DR4, DR5, DR9) supertypes. Supertype B mismatch was associated with increased risk of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (hazard ratio =1.78, P=0.0025) compared to supertype B match. Supertype B07-B44 mismatch was associated with a higher incidence of both grade II-IV (hazard ratio=3.11, P=0.002) and III-IV (hazard ratio=3.15, P=0.01) acute graft-versus-host disease. No significant associations were detected between supertype-matched versus -mismatched groups at other HLA loci. These data suggest that avoiding HLA-B supertype mismatches can mitigate the risk of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease in 7/8-mismatched unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation when multiple HLA-B supertype-matched donors are available. Future studies are needed to define the mechanisms by which supertype mismatching affects outcomes after alternative donor hematopoietic cell transplantation.","['Lazaryan, Aleksandr', 'Wang, Tao', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Wang, Hai-Lin', 'Pidala, Joseph', 'Nishihori, Taiga', 'Askar, Medhat', 'Olsson, Richard', 'Oudshoorn, Machteld', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham', 'Yong, Agnes', 'Gandhi, Manish', 'Dandoy, Christopher', 'Savani, Bipin', 'Hale, Gregory', 'Page, Kristin', 'Bitan, Menachem', 'Reshef, Ran', 'Drobyski, William', 'Marsh, Steven Ge', 'Schultz, Kirk', 'Muller, Carlheinz R', 'Fernandez-Vina, Marcelo A', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Horowitz, Mary M', 'Arora, Mukta', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Lee, Stephanie J']","['Lazaryan A', 'Wang T', 'Spellman SR', 'Wang HL', 'Pidala J', 'Nishihori T', 'Askar M', 'Olsson R', 'Oudshoorn M', 'Abdel-Azim H', 'Yong A', 'Gandhi M', 'Dandoy C', 'Savani B', 'Hale G', 'Page K', 'Bitan M', 'Reshef R', 'Drobyski W', 'Marsh SG', 'Schultz K', 'Muller CR', 'Fernandez-Vina MA', 'Verneris MR', 'Horowitz MM', 'Arora M', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Lee SJ']","['University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, Minneapolis, MN, USA alazarya@umn.edu.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'H.

To evaluate idelalisib as front-line therapy, we enrolled 24 subjects in a phase 2 study consisting of 2 months of idelalisib monotherapy followed by 6 months of combination therapy with idelalisib and the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab. After a median follow-up period of 14.7 months, hepatotoxicity was found to be a frequent and often severe adverse event. A total of 19 subjects (79%) experienced either grade >/=1 ALT or AST elevation during the study, and 13 subjects (54%) experienced grade >/=3 transaminitis. The median time to development of transaminitis was 28 days, occurring before ofatumumab introduction. Younger age and mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain status were significant risk factors for the development of hepatotoxicity. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that this hepatotoxicity was immune mediated. A lymphocytic infiltrate was seen on liver biopsy specimens taken from 2 subjects with transaminitis, and levels of the proinflammatory cytokines CCL-3 and CCL-4 were higher in subjects experiencing hepatotoxicity. All cases of transaminitis resolved either by holding the drug, initiating immunosuppressants, or both, and rates of recurrent toxicity were lower in patients taking steroids when idelalisib was reinitiated. A decrease in peripheral blood regulatory T cells was seen in patients experiencing toxicity on therapy, which is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism. These results suggest that caution should be taken as drugs within this class are developed for CLL, particularly in younger patients who have not received prior disease-specific therapy.

The genetic abnormalities underlying AML affect signal transduction pathways, transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers. In solid tumours, it is emerging that the genetic landscape of the tumour has a direct effect on the anti-tumour immune responses and response to immunotherapeutic treatment. However, there remains little information as to whether genetic abnormalities affect anti-leukemic immune responses. This review discusses current knowledge of AML antigens and immune responses to AML with a particular focus on the role of T cells and natural killer cells. Understanding immune responses to AML has implications for the development and use of immunotherapies to treat AML patients with distinct genetic abnormalities.","['Austin, Rebecca', 'Smyth, Mark J', 'Lane, Steven W']","['Austin R', 'Smyth MJ', 'Lane SW']","['QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, 300 Herston Road, Herston, QLD 4006, Australia.', 'QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, 300 Herston Road, Herston, QLD 4006, Australia; School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia.

To enhance the therapeutic efficacy of carfilzomib, we sought to combine carfilzomib with other novel agents. TG02, a multi-kinase inhibitor, targets JAK2 and CDK9. The rationale for co-treatment with carfilzomib and TG02 is that both independently target Mcl-1 and most myeloma cells are dependent on this anti-apoptotic protein for survival. We observed at least additive effects using the combination treatment in MM cell lines and patient samples. To determine how the bone marrow environment affects the efficacy of the combination we conducted co-culture experiments with Hs-5 stromal cells. We also examined the mechanism of increased apoptosis by determining the affect on expression of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. We found that carfilzomib increases NOXA mRNA expression, as expected, and TG02 treatment caused a decrease in Mcl-1 protein but not mRNA levels. Consistent with this possibility, we find silencing CDK9 does not change carfilzomib sensitivity in the same manner as addition of TG02. Since changes in Mcl-1 protein occur in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor we hypothesize that regulation of Mcl-1 translation is the most likely mechanism. Taken together our data suggest that dual inhibition of Mcl-1 via decreased expression and the induction of its antagonist NOXA by the combination of carfilzomib and TG02 is active in myeloma and warrants further testing preclinically and in clinical trials. Moreover, regulation of Mcl-1 by TG02 is more complex than initially appreciated.","['Ponder, Katelyn G', 'Matulis, Shannon M', 'Hitosugi, Sadae', 'Gupta, Vikas A', 'Sharp, Cathy', 'Burrows, Francis', 'Nooka, Ajay K', 'Kaufman, Jonathan L', 'Lonial, Sagar', 'Boise, Lawrence H']","['Ponder KG', 'Matulis SM', 'Hitosugi S', 'Gupta VA', 'Sharp C', 'Burrows F', 'Nooka AK', 'Kaufman JL', 'Lonial S', 'Boise LH']","['a Cancer Biology Graduate Program , Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'b Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'b Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'b Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'c Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'd Tragara Pharmaceuticals , San Diego , CA , USA.', 'b Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'c Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'b Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'c Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'b Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'c Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'b Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.', 'c Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University , Atlanta , GA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0', '(14-methyl-20-oxa-5,7,14,26-tetraazatetracyclo(19.3.1.1(2,6).1(8,12))heptacosa-1(', '25),2(26),3,5,8(27),9,11,16,21,23-decaene)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '72X6E3J5AR (carfilzomib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oligopeptides/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Bcl-2', '*plasma cell dyscrasia']",2016/06/02 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384047.2016.1192086 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2016 Jul 2;17(7):769-77. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2016.1192086.,10.1080/15384047.2016.1192086 [doi],"['R01 GM106565/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4970534,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard treatment for ALL nowadays consists of polychemotherapy. Therefore, assessment of potential chemotherapy-induced cognitive side effects becomes important. Although neurotoxicity was demonstrated in cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies remain scarce. PROCEDURE: We evaluated intellectual development of 94 pediatric ALL patients between 1990 and 1997, diagnosed before the age of 12 years, treated according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Children's Leukemia Group 58881 protocol. Three assessments of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Revised were performed since diagnosis, according to age. Using repeated measures regression analysis, we investigated the effect of gender (low versus increased) risk group, parents' education, age at diagnosis, intelligence quotient (IQ) subscale (verbal (VIQ) versus performance (PIQ) intelligence), and test session. RESULTS: PIQ scores were lower than VIQ at baseline (-5.3 points on average, p = 0.0032), yet PIQ increased more strongly (PIQ: +3.9 points per test session; VIQ: +0.8, p = 0.0079), so this baseline difference disappeared (p = 0.0079). There were no clear effects of gender (girls: +0.6 points; p = 0.78) or risk group (low risk: +1.5 points; p = 0.49), but IQ scores were higher when one parent had followed higher education (+9.5 points, p < 0.0001). Finally, diagnosis at younger age predicted lower IQ scores (-1.3 points per year, p = 0.0009). CONCLUSION: Given that IQ scores did not decline, our findings demonstrate a stable pattern. However, the lower PIQ scores at baseline may indicate that performance functioning is vulnerable to acute neurotoxicity. Also, lower scores for younger patients highlight the stronger impact of the disease and/or treatment at younger age.Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","['Sleurs, Charlotte', 'Lemiere, Jurgen', 'Vercruysse, Trui', 'Nolf, Nathalie', 'Van Calster, Ben', 'Deprez, Sabine', 'Renard, Marleen', 'Vandecruys, Els', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne']","['Sleurs C', 'Lemiere J', 'Vercruysse T', 'Nolf N', 'Van Calster B', 'Deprez S', 'Renard M', 'Vandecruys E', 'Benoit Y', 'Uyttebroeck A']","['University Hospitals Leuven, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven, Department of Development and Regeneration, Leuven, Belgium.', 'University Hospitals Leuven, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'University Hospitals Leuven, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Ghent University Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ghent, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven, Department of Development and Regeneration, Leuven, Belgium.', 'University Hospitals Leuven, Department of Radiology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven, Department of Imaging and Pathology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'University Hospitals Leuven, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Ghent University Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Ghent University Hospital, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ghent, Belgium.', 'University Hospitals Leuven, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven, Department of Development and Regeneration, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160620,England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', '*Child Development', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Intelligence', '*Intelligence Tests', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology', 'Wechsler Scales']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*cancer', '*development', '*intelligence', '*oncology', '*performance versus verbal intelligence']",2016/06/02 06:00,2017/12/21 06:00,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2015/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/26 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.4186 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2017 Apr;26(4):508-514. doi: 10.1002/pon.4186.

In a chromosomal instable p53 deficient mouse model with accelerated lymphomagenesis, we previously observed whole chromosome copy number changes affecting all lymphoma cells. This suggests that chromosome instability is somehow suppressed in the aneuploid lymphomas or that selection for frequently lost/gained chromosomes out-competes the CIN-imposed mis-segregation. RESULTS: To distinguish between these explanations and to examine karyotype dynamics in chromosome instable lymphoma, we use a newly developed single-cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS) platform that provides a complete and unbiased overview of copy number variations (CNV) in individual cells. To analyse these scWGS data, we develop AneuFinder, which allows annotation of copy number changes in a fully automated fashion and quantification of CNV heterogeneity between cells. Single-cell sequencing and AneuFinder analysis reveals high levels of copy number heterogeneity in chromosome instability-driven murine T-cell lymphoma samples, indicating ongoing chromosome instability. Application of this technology to human B cell leukaemias reveals different levels of karyotype heterogeneity in these cancers. CONCLUSION: Our data show that even though aneuploid tumours select for particular and recurring chromosome combinations, single-cell analysis using AneuFinder reveals copy number heterogeneity. This suggests ongoing chromosome instability that other platforms fail to detect. As chromosome instability might drive tumour evolution, karyotype analysis using single-cell sequencing technology could become an essential tool for cancer treatment stratification.","['Bakker, Bjorn', 'Taudt, Aaron', 'Belderbos, Mirjam E', 'Porubsky, David', 'Spierings, Diana C J', 'de Jong, Tristan V', 'Halsema, Nancy', 'Kazemier, Hinke G', 'Hoekstra-Wakker, Karina', 'Bradley, Allan', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M', 'van den Berg, Anke', 'Guryev, Victor', 'Lansdorp, Peter M', 'Colome-Tatche, Maria', 'Foijer, Floris']","['Bakker B', 'Taudt A', 'Belderbos ME', 'Porubsky D', 'Spierings DC', 'de Jong TV', 'Halsema N', 'Kazemier HG', 'Hoekstra-Wakker K', 'Bradley A', 'de Bont ES', 'van den Berg A', 'Guryev V', 'Lansdorp PM', 'Colome-Tatche M', 'Foijer F']","['European Research Institute for the Biology of Ageing, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, A.

Previous work has mostly taken either a hypothesis testing framework or a Bayesian framework. In this paper, we propose a few approaches under a frequentist variable selection framework for spatial cluster detection. The forward stepwise methods search for multiple clusters by iteratively adding currently most likely cluster while adjusting for the effects of previously identified clusters. The stagewise methods also consist of a series of steps, but with a tiny step size in each iteration. We study the features and performances of our proposed methods using simulations on idealized grids or real geographic areas. From the simulations, we compare the performance of the proposed methods in terms of estimation accuracy and power.

Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are treated at a wide variety of hospitals. We investigated if inpatient hospital volume influences outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between inpatient pediatric and pediatric oncology volume and mortality and intensive care resources (ICU care). We hypothesized an inverse relationship between volume and these outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Patients 0 to 18 years of age in the Pediatric Health Information System or Perspective Premier Database from 2009 to 2011 with ALL were included. Exposures were considered as the average inpatient pediatric and pediatric oncology volume. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality; secondary outcome was need for ICU care. RESULTS: The included population comprised 3350 patients from 75 hospitals. The inpatient mortality rate was 0.86% (95% confidence interval, 0.58%-1.2%). In the unadjusted analysis, mortality increased as pediatric oncology volume increased from low (0%) to high volume (1.3%) (P = .009). The small number of deaths precluded multivariable analysis of this outcome. Pediatric and pediatric oncology volume was not associated with ICU care when we controlled for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Induction mortality was low. We did not observe an inverse relationship between volume and mortality or ICU care. This suggests that in a modern treatment era, treatment at a low-volume center might not be associated with increased mortality or ICU care in the first portion of therapy. This relationship should be evaluated in other oncology populations with higher mortality rates and with longer-term outcomes.","['Wilkes, Jennifer J', 'Hennessy, Sean', 'Xiao, Rui', 'Rheingold, Susan', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung', 'Vendetti, Neika', 'Li, Yimei', 'Bagatell, Rochelle', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Fisher, Brian T']","['Wilkes JJ', 'Hennessy S', 'Xiao R', 'Rheingold S', 'Seif AE', 'Huang YS', 'Vendetti N', 'Li Y', 'Bagatell R', 'Aplenc R', 'Fisher BT']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.

METHODS: One thousand four hundred fourteen urban and rural survivors were recruited from five Australian population-based cancer registries and completed a self-report pen-and-paper survey on their well-being, including the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21-item version. RESULTS: A quarter of survivors were identified as reporting above normal levels of anxiety and depression, respectively, and almost one fifth (17 %) reported above normal levels of stress. There were no statistically significant differences in the percentage of rural and urban survivors reporting above normal levels of anxiety, depression, or stress. Survivors who had experienced financial burden due to their cancer or were of middle age had higher odds of reporting multiple domains of psychological distress, compared to their counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Haematological cancer survivors diagnosed during middle age or who experience increased financial burden as a result of their diagnosis may require additional support and care with regards to psychological distress.","['Hall, Alix E', 'Sanson-Fisher, Rob W', 'Carey, Mariko L', 'Paul, Chris', 'Williamson, Anna', 'Bradstock, Ken', 'Campbell, H Sharon']","['Hall AE', 'Sanson-Fisher RW', 'Carey ML', 'Paul C', 'Williamson A', 'Bradstock K', 'Campbell HS']","['Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, Faculty of Health, The University of Newcastle, W4-088 HMRI Building University Drive, Callaghan, NSW, Australia, 2308. alix.hall@newcastle.edu.au.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton Heights, NSW, Australia. alix.hall@newcastle.edu.au.', 'Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, Faculty of Health, The University of Newcastle, W4-088 HMRI Building University Drive, Callaghan, NSW, Australia, 2308.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton Heights, NSW, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, Faculty of Health, The University of Newcastle, W4-088 HMRI Building University Drive, Callaghan, NSW, Australia, 2308.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton Heights, NSW, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, Faculty of Health, The University of Newcastle, W4-088 HMRI Building University Drive, Callaghan, NSW, Australia, 2308.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton Heights, NSW, Australia.', 'The Leukaemia Foundation, Windsor, QLD, Australia.', 'Haematology Department, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, NSW, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Propel Centre for Population Health Impact, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160531,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Stress, Psychological/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/psychology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Distress', '*Geographical location', '*Haematological cancer', '*Oncology']",2016/06/02 06:00,2017/10/14 06:00,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2016/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00520-016-3282-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-016-3282-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2016 Oct;24(10):4413-22. doi: 10.1007/s00520-016-3282-3.

Recognising the importance of research in addressing the cancer burden, the Ministerial Advisory Committee on the Prevention and Control of Cancer (MACC) research working group undertook a review of the current cancer research landscape in SA and related this to the cancer burden. METHODS: Academic and research institutions in SA were contacted to provide information on the titles of all current and recently completed (2013/2014) cancer research projects. Three MACC research working group members used the project titles to independently classify the projects by type of research (basic, clinical and public health - projects could be classified in more than one category) and disease site. A more detailed classification of projects addressing the five most common cancers diagnosed in males and females in SA was conducted using an adapted Common Scientific Outline (CSO) categorisation. RESULTS: Information was available on 556 cancer research projects. Overall, 301 projects were classified as clinical, 254 as basic science and 71 as public health research. The most common cancers being researched were cancers of the breast (n=95 projects) and cervix (n=43), leukaemia (n=36), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=35) and lung cancer (n=23). Classification of the five most common cancers in males and females in SA, using the adapted CSO categories, showed that the majority of projects related to treatment, with relatively few projects on prevention, survivorship and patient perspectives. CONCLUSION: Our findings established that there is a dearth of public health cancer research in SA.","['Moodley, Jennifer', 'Stefan, D Cristina', 'Sewram, Vikash', 'Ruff, Paul', 'Freeman, Melvyn', 'Asante-Shongwe, Kwanele']","['Moodley J', 'Stefan DC', 'Sewram V', 'Ruff P', 'Freeman M', 'Asante-Shongwe K']","[""Cancer Research Initiative, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, South Africa; Women's Health Research Unit, School of Public Health and Family Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, South Africa. jennifer.moodley@uct.ac.za.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160510,South Africa,S Afr Med J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,0404520,,,,,,2016/06/02 06:00,2016/06/02 06:01,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2015/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7196/SAMJ.2016.v106i6.10314 [doi]'],epublish,S Afr Med J. 2016 May 10;106(6). doi: 10.7196/SAMJ.2016.v106i6.10314.,10.7196/SAMJ.2016.v106i6.10314 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Part of this care is provided by family physicians and non-cancer specialists, but their involvement in the first years after diagnosis has barely been studied. Studying non-oncology physician visits may provide insight into the roles of different health care providers. METHODS: We included 757 children diagnosed with cancer under age 15 between 1991 and 2001 from a Canadian provincial registry, and matched each to 10 controls of the same birth year and sex. We determined the number of family physician and non-cancer specialist visits in the 5 years after diagnosis (for patients) or inclusion (for controls) using data from the provincial health insurance plan. RESULTS: In the first year after diagnosis, almost all patients visited both a family physician and non-cancer specialist. Although after 5 years percentages decreased to 85 and 76 %, respectively, these were still significantly higher than in controls. In the first year after diagnosis, both family physicians and non-cancer specialists were often consulted for neoplasms (62 and 90 %, respectively) and to discuss results of lab tests. In addition, family physicians were often consulted for general symptoms and non-cancer specialists for nervous system problems and complications of medical care. CONCLUSIONS: Family physicians and non-cancer specialists are highly involved in the care for children with cancer in the first years after diagnosis, including for health problems related to cancer or its treatment. This necessitates good communication among all physicians.","['Heins, Marianne J', 'Lorenzi, Maria F', 'Korevaar, Joke C', 'McBride, Mary L']","['Heins MJ', 'Lorenzi MF', 'Korevaar JC', 'McBride ML']","['Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (NIVEL), P.O Box 1568, 3500 BN, Utrecht, The Netherlands. m.heins@nivel.nl.', 'BC Cancer Research Centre, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (NIVEL), P.O Box 1568, 3500 BN, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'BC Cancer Research Centre, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160601,England,BMC Fam Pract,BMC family practice,100967792,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'British Columbia', 'Cardiology/statistics & numerical data', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Family Practice/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'General Surgery/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Nervous System Diseases/therapy', 'Office Visits/*statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Pediatrics/statistics & numerical data', ""*Physician's Role"", 'Respiratory Tract Infections/therapy', 'Symptom Assessment', 'Time Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Child', '*Child health services', '*Leukemia', '*Lymphoma', '*Neoplasms', '*Primary health care']",2016/06/02 06:00,2017/11/08 06:00,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2015/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12875-016-0462-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12875-016-0462-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Fam Pract. 2016 Jun 1;17:60. doi: 10.1186/s12875-016-0462-7.,10.1186/s12875-016-0462-7 [doi],,PMC4888649,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Doubts on the bioequivalence and bioavailability of emerging generic compounds have been expressed. Adequate imatinib plasma concentration ([IPC] >/=1000 mumol/L) is associated with a better chance of optimal treatment response in patients with CML. In this study, we compared the achieved IPCs between the branded compound and its 2 generic forms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IPCs were compared in 24 consecutive patients with CML in the first chronic phase who changed from branded to generic imatinib. The median age was 49 years (range, 22-76 years). Fifteen of them were male. Six patients were switched to Neopax, 13 to Imakrebin, and 5 patients received both generics consecutively. All compounds were used in an equivalent dose of 400 mg orally once daily for at least 1 month before plasma concentrations were measured. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine imatinib plasma concentration from a specimen collected 21 to 24 hours after the last dose. RESULTS: The median IPC achieved with branded imatinib was 1454 mumol/L (range, 485-2707 mumol/L) with 18 patients (75%) having IPC >/= 1000 mumol/L. For Neopax and Imakrebin, median IPCs were 1717 mumol/L (range, 1249-3630 mumol/L) and 1458 mumol/L (range, 707-880 mumol/L), respectively, with 11 of 11 (100%) and 16 of 18 (89%) patients having IPC >/= 1000 mumol/L. No significant difference in measured IPCs between all 3 compounds was found (P > .257). CONCLUSION: When taken at equivalent doses, imatinib generics are bioequivalent and comparable in clinical efficacy and have the potential for substantial savings in the treatment cost for CML.","['Ostojic, Alen', 'Sertic, Dubravka', 'Roncevic, Pavle', 'Peric, Zinaida', 'Granic, Paula', 'Matic, Nikolina', 'Basic-Kinda, Sandra', 'Serventi-Seiwerth, Ranka', 'Radman, Ivo', 'Zadro, Renata', 'Nemet, Damir']","['Ostojic A', 'Sertic D', 'Roncevic P', 'Peric Z', 'Granic P', 'Matic N', 'Basic-Kinda S', 'Serventi-Seiwerth R', 'Radman I', 'Zadro R', 'Nemet D']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Division, University Hospital Center Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.

In patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) receiving targeted mutant IDH inhibitor therapy, neutrophil recovery within the setting of clinical differentiation syndrome (DS) has been anecdotally described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe 3 patients who developed clinically apparent DS during monotherapy with the mutant IDH1 inhibitor, AG-120, for relapsed/refractory AML. RESULTS: AG-120-induced differentiation commenced within the first 60 days of treatment, notably in the same time frame as clinical response, strengthening the purported mechanism of targeted mutant IDH inhibitor therapy via successful myeloid maturation. Symptoms of DS were nonspecific and included culture-negative fever, edema, hypotension, malaise, and pleural and/or pericardial effusions, in addition to marked neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis. CONCLUSION: DS can occur during treatment with targeted mutant IDH1 inhibitor therapy. Patients might present with nonspecific clinical manifestations often in the setting of leukocytosis related to exuberant neutrophil recovery.

A large-scale, registry-based assessment of the impact of the banking variables on the clinical outcome is currently missing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 677 single cord blood transplants (CBTs) carried out for acute leukemia in complete remission in centers affiliated with the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation were selected. An extensive set of data concerning CBU banking were collected and correlations with clinical outcome were assessed. Clinical endpoints were transplant-related mortality, engraftment, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). RESULTS: The median time between collection and CBT was 4.1 years (range, 0.2-16.3 years). Volume reduction (VR) of CBUs before freezing was performed in 59.2% of available reports; in half of these the frozen volume was less than 30 mL. Cumulative incidences of neutrophil engraftment on Day 60, 100-day acute GVHD (II-IV), and 4-year chronic GVHD were 87, 29, and 21 +/- 2%. The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days and 4-year NRM were, respectively, 16 +/- 2 and 30 +/- 2%. Neither the variables related to banking procedures nor the interval between collection and CBT influenced the clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate a satisfactory validation of the techniques associated with CBU VR across the banks. Cell viability assessment varied among the banks, suggesting that efforts to improve the standardization of CBU quality controls are needed.","['Saccardi, Riccardo', 'Tucunduva, Luciana', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Ionescu, Irina', 'Koegler, Gesine', 'Querol, Sergio', 'Grazzini, Giuliano', 'Lecchi, Lucilla', 'Nanni Costa, Alessandro', 'Navarrete, Cristina', 'Pouthiers, Fabienne', 'Larghero, Jerome', 'Regan, Donna', 'Freeman, Taryn', 'Bittencourt, Henrique', 'Kenzey, Chantal', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Baudoux, Etienne', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Gluckman, Eliane']","['Saccardi R', 'Tucunduva L', 'Ruggeri A', 'Ionescu I', 'Koegler G', 'Querol S', 'Grazzini G', 'Lecchi L', 'Nanni Costa A', 'Navarrete C', 'Pouthiers F', 'Larghero J', 'Regan D', 'Freeman T', 'Bittencourt H', 'Kenzey C', 'Labopin M', 'Baudoux E', 'Rocha V', 'Gluckman E']","['Careggi University Hospital, Firenze, Italy.', 'Eurocord, Hospital Saint Louis, AP-HP, and IUH University Paris VII, Paris, France.', 'Eurocord, Hospital Saint Louis, AP-HP, and IUH University Paris VII, Paris, France.', 'Eurocord, Hospital Saint Louis, AP-HP, and IUH University Paris VII, Paris, France.', ""Hospital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, AP-HP, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMR-S 938, CEREST-TC EBMT, Paris, France."", 'Agence de la Biomedicine, Paris, France.', 'Dusseldorf Cord Blood Bank, University of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Barcelona Cord Blood Bank, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro Nazionale Sangue, Rome, Italy.', ""Milano Cord Blood Bank, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Centro Nazionale Trapianti, Rome, Italy.', 'NHS-Cord Blood Bank, NHSBT, and University College London, London, UK.', 'Besancon Cord Blood Bank of the Etablissement Francais du Sang, Besancon, France.', 'Paris Cord Blood Bank, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'St Louis Cord Blood Bank & Cellular Therapy Laboratory, St Louis, Missouri.', 'Sydney Cord Blood Bank, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Eurocord, Hospital Saint Louis, AP-HP, and IUH University Paris VII, Paris, France.', ""Hospital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, AP-HP, UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMR-S 938, CEREST-TC EBMT, Paris, France."", 'NetCord Foundation and Liege Cord Blood Bank, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Eurocord, Hospital Saint Louis, AP-HP, and IUH University Paris VII, Paris, France.', 'Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals, Oxford, UK.', 'Eurocord, Hospital Saint Louis, AP-HP, and IUH University Paris VII, Paris, France.', 'Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Monaco.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160531,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Blood Banks/statistics & numerical data', 'Blood Transfusion/*methods', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Fetal Blood/*physiology/*transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/06/02 06:00,2017/06/20 06:00,['2016/06/02 06:00'],"['2015/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2016/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/trf.13661 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2016 Aug;56(8):2021-9. doi: 10.1111/trf.13661.

The growth characteristics of MMSCs of all patients before allo-HSCT were not altered; however, relative expression level (REL) of some genes in MMSCs, but not in CFU-Fs, from AML and ALL patients significantly changed. After allo-HSCT, CFU-F concentration and MMSC production were significantly decreased for 1 year; REL of several genes in MMSCs and CFU-F-derived colonies were also significantly downregulated.

Knowledge gaps have resulted in under diagnosis or delayed diagnosis. METHODS: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center pathology database (1991-2014) was retrospectively interrogated for the keywords ""hemophagocytosis"" and/or ""lymphohistiocytosis."" Seventy-seven adult patients were identified. All had an underlying malignancy. Sixteen patients who had insufficient documentation were excluded. RESULTS: The majority of patients who had pathologic evidence of hemophagocytosis/lymphohistiocytosis had an incomplete workup to confirm or refute HLH using the 2004 HLH criteria (HLH-2004; n = 8 variables), which is a common problem in adult HLH. Only 13 of 61 patients (21%) met the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria based on available retrospective data. To identify potentially missed cases of HLH, the published literature was reviewed, and selected additional variables known to be associated with adult HLH were selected, resulting in extended diagnostic criteria of 18 variables. Thirty-five patients met the extended criteria, and 33 had follow-up data available. The median overall survival of the 13 patients who met both the extended criteria and the HLH-2004 criteria was similar to that of the 20 patients who met the extended criteria but NOT the HLH-2004 criteria (1.43 vs 1.76 months, respectively; P = .34) indicating a similar underlying, aggressive, systemic process. Twenty-six patients did not meet either criteria, and 17 had follow-up data available. The median overall survival of the 17 patients who had pathologic hemophagocytosis or lymphohistiocytosis but met neither criteria was significantly superior to the survival of those who met both the extended criteria and the HLH-2004 criteria and those who met the extended criteria but not the HLH-2004 criteria (17.27 vs 1.43 vs 1.76, respectively; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of diagnostic laboratory variables that are more easily and rapidly available in smaller institutions and primary care settings than the HLH-2004 variables may be a good surrogate to raise early suspicion of malignancy-associated HLH.

Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is considered the mainstay of the treatment for both subtypes of leukemia due to their refractoriness to chemotherapy and high rates of relapse, it remains unclear whether allo-HSCT is curative in such cases due to their scarcity. We retrospectively examined the impact of allo-HSCT in 382 patients with M6 and 108 patients with M7 using nationwide HSCT data and found the overall survival (OS) and relapse rates of the M6 patients to be significantly better than those of the M7 patients after adjusting for confounding factors and statistically comparable with those of the patients with M0/M1/M2/M4/M5 disease. Consequently, the factors of age, gender, performance status, karyotype, disease status at HSCT and development of graft-vs.-host disease predicted the OS for the M6 patients, while the performance status and disease status at HSCT were predictive of the OS for the M7 patients. These findings substantiate the importance of distinguishing between M6 and M7 in the HSCT setting and suggest that unknown mechanisms influence the HSCT outcomes of these closely related subtypes of leukemia.","['Ishiyama, Ken', 'Yamaguchi, Takuhiro', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Miyamura, Koichi', 'Inoue, Yoshiko', 'Taguchi, Jun', 'Mori, Takehiko', 'Iwato, Koji', 'Morishima, Yasuo', 'Nagamura-Inoue, Tokiko', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Takami, Akiyoshi']","['Ishiyama K', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Eto T', 'Ohashi K', 'Uchida N', 'Kanamori H', 'Fukuda T', 'Miyamura K', 'Inoue Y', 'Taguchi J', 'Mori T', 'Iwato K', 'Morishima Y', 'Nagamura-Inoue T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Sakamaki H', 'Takami A']","['Department of Hematology, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.

Here, we further characterized the clonal composition and evolution of the AML based on the genetic information from the bulk specimen and analyses of individual bone marrow cells for mutations in CAND1, PTPRT, and DOCK6. To control for allele dropout, heterozygous polymorphisms located close to the respective mutation loci were assessed in parallel. The clonal composition concluded from exome sequencing suggested a proliferation advantage associated with the acquisition of mutations in CAND1, PTPRT, and DOCK6. Out of 102 single cell sequencing reactions on these mutations and the respective polymorphisms, analyses yielded conclusive results for at least 2 mutation sites in 12 cells. The single cell genotyping not only confirmed the co-occurrence of the PTPRT, CAND1 and DOCK6 mutations in the same AML clone but also revealed a clonal hierarchy, as the PTPRT mutation was likely acquired after the CAND1 and DOCK6 mutations. This insight had not been possible based solely on the exome sequencing data and suggests that the mutation in PTPRT, which encodes a STAT3-inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatase, contributed to the AML development at a later stage by enhancing proliferation.","['Niemoller, Christoph', 'Renz, Nathalie', 'Bleul, Sabine', 'Blagitko-Dorfs, Nadja', 'Greil, Christine', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Follo, Marie', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Claus, Rainer', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Becker, Heiko']","['Niemoller C', 'Renz N', 'Bleul S', 'Blagitko-Dorfs N', 'Greil C', 'Yoshida K', 'Pfeifer D', 'Follo M', 'Duyster J', 'Claus R', 'Ogawa S', 'Lubbert M', 'Becker H']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University Freiburg-Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Freiburg-Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Freiburg-Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Freiburg-Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Freiburg-Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Freiburg-Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Freiburg-Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Freiburg-Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Freiburg-Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Freiburg-Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Freiburg-Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Freiburg, Germany.

The mechanisms underlying resistance to TKIs are not well understood. In this study, we analyzed ceramide levels in CD34 cells derived from BP-CML patients and healthy donor bone marrow (BM) using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. We found that ceramide level was significantly lower in BP-CML CD34 compared with normal BM counterparts. BP-CML CD34 ceramide(low) were more resistant to BCR-ABL TKIs compared to BP-CML CD34 ceramide(normal). Both mRNA and proteins levels of sphingomyelin synthase 1 and 2 are lower in BP-CML CD34 ceramide(low) compared to normal BM CD34 cells, suggesting that these two ceramide synthesis enzymes maybe the mechanism of how ceramide level is suppressed. Importantly, up-regulation of cellular ceramide level induces apoptosis of multiple CML cell lines and BP-CML CD34 progenitors. Combination of BCR-ABL TKIs with ceramide analog is synergistic in targeting BP-CML 34 progenitors. Collectively, our work provides evidence that down-regulation of ceramide level is involved in the resistance of BP-CML CD34 progenitors to TKIs treatment. Targeting ceramide metabolism together with BCR-ABL inhibition makes it an attractive addition to the armamentarium in BP-CML treatment.","['Wang, Jiaqiao', 'Hu, June', 'Jin, Zhiliang', 'Wan, Huihui']","['Wang J', 'Hu J', 'Jin Z', 'Wan H']","[""Department of Oncology, JingZhou Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Jing Zhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, JingZhou Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Jing Zhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, JingZhou Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Jing Zhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, JingZhou Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Jing Zhou, People's Republic of China.

They are thought to exert their therapeutic effects through multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenases, modulation of NF-kappaB activity, and direct activation of AMPK. However, the full spectrum of their activities is incompletely understood. Here we show that salicylate specifically inhibits CBP and p300 lysine acetyltransferase activity in vitro by direct competition with acetyl-Coenzyme A at the catalytic site. We used a chemical structure-similarity search to identify another anti-inflammatory drug, diflunisal, that inhibits p300 more potently than salicylate. At concentrations attainable in human plasma after oral administration, both salicylate and diflunisal blocked the acetylation of lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins in cells. Finally, we found that diflunisal suppressed the growth of p300-dependent leukemia cell lines expressing AML1-ETO fusion protein in vitro and in vivo. These results highlight a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism of action for salicylate and derivative drugs.","['Shirakawa, Kotaro', 'Wang, Lan', 'Man, Na', 'Maksimoska, Jasna', 'Sorum, Alexander

In addition to musculoskeletal and neurodevelopmental abnormalities, children with DS exhibit various hematologic disorders and have an increased risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute megakaryocytic leukemia. Using the Ts65Dn mouse model, we investigated bone marrow defects caused by trisomy for 132 orthologs of the genes on human chromosome 21. The results showed that, although the total bone marrow cellularity as well as the frequency of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) was comparable between Ts65Dn mice and their age-matched euploid wild-type (WT) control littermates, human chromosome 21 trisomy led to a significant reduction in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) numbers and clonogenic function in Ts65Dn mice. We also found that spontaneous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were significantly increased in HSCs from the Ts65Dn mice, which was correlated with the significant reduction in HSC clonogenic activity compared to those from WT controls. Moreover, analysis of the repair kinetics of radiation-induced DSBs revealed that HSCs from Ts65Dn mice were less proficient in DSB repair than the cells from WT controls. This deficiency was associated with a higher sensitivity of Ts65Dn HSCs to radiation-induced suppression of HSC clonogenic activity than that of euploid HSCs. These findings suggest that an additional copy of genes on human chromosome 21 may selectively impair the ability of HSCs to repair DSBs, which may contribute to DS-associated hematological abnormalities and malignancies.","['Wang, Yingying', 'Chang, Jianhui', 'Shao, Lijian', 'Feng, Wei', 'Luo, Yi', 'Chow, Marie', 'Du, Wei', 'Meng, Aimin', 'Zhou, Daohong']","['Wang Y', 'Chang J', 'Shao L', 'Feng W', 'Luo Y', 'Chow M', 'Du W', 'Meng A', 'Zhou D']","['a Tianjin Key Laboratory of Radiation Medicine and Molecular Nuclear Medicine, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Collage, Tianjin 300192, China; and.', 'b Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', 'b Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', 'b Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', 'b Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', 'b Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', 'c Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas 72205.', 'b Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.', 'a Tianjin Key Laboratory of Radiation Medicine and Molecular Nuclear Medicine, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical Collage, Tianjin 300192, China; and.', 'b Division of Radiation Health, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160531,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/radiation effects', '*DNA Repair/radiation effects', 'Down Syndrome/*genetics/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Mice']",,,2016/06/01 06:00,2017/05/11 06:00,['2016/06/01 06:00'],"['2016/06/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1667/RR14407.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2016 Jun;185(6):630-7. doi: 10.1667/RR14407.1.

NK cells belong to the expanding family of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). At variance with NK cells, the other ILC populations (ILC1/2/3) are non-cytolytic, while they secrete different patterns of cytokines. ILCs provide host defenses against viruses, bacteria, and parasites, drive lymphoid organogenesis, and contribute to tissue remodeling. In haplo-HSCT patients, the extensive T-cell depletion is required to prevent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) but increases risks of developing a wide range of life-threatening infections. However, these patients may rely on innate defenses that are reconstituted more rapidly than the adaptive ones. In this context, ILCs may represent important players in the early phases following transplantation. They may contribute to tissue homeostasis/remodeling and lymphoid tissue reconstitution. While the reconstitution of NK cell repertoire and its role in haplo-HSCT have been largely investigated, little information is available on ILCs. Of note, CD34(+) cells isolated from different sources of HSC may differentiate in vitro toward various ILC subsets. Moreover, cytokines released from leukemia blasts (e.g., IL-1beta) may alter the proportions of NK cells and ILC3, suggesting the possibility that leukemia may skew the ILC repertoire.

METHODS: The pathologic profiles of 92 patients with CD5 positive SBL were retrospectively analyzed. The morphologic and immunophenotypic features were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. IgH/CCND1 was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: A total of 92 patients with CD5 positive SBL were enrolled in this study, including 56 (60.9%) chronic lymphocytic leukemia /small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), 23 (25.0%) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and 13 other SBL (14.1%). Among the 13 other cases, 5, 4 and 4 cases were follicular lymphoma (FL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), respectively. The frequency of patterns for bone marrow infiltration was as follow: diffuse pattern (19/92), mixed pattern (15/92), nodular pattern (9/92), interstitial pattern (8/92), and intrasinusodial pattern (2/92). All patients expressed CD19, CD20 and CD5. According to the immunophenotypic score system, all the CLL patients had 4-5 scores, while SMCL and other SBL patients had less than 3 scores. For the other SBL patients, 5 FL expressed CD10, while 3 FL, 1 LPL and 3 SMZL expressed CD23. There was a significant difference in the expression of CD23, sIgM, FMC7, CD11C and CD22 between the CLL and MCL groups (P<0.01). All 23 MCL patients expressed cyclin D1 and showed IgH/CCND1 gene translocation by FISH detection. CONCLUSION: CD5 positive SBL includes a variety of types of lymphoma. Patterns of bone marrow for CD5 positive SBL are diversity. Immunophenotypic analysis by flow cytometry is essential in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of CD5 positive SBL, especially for CLL.","['Peng, Shusong', 'Zhu, Fuqiang', 'You, Sijing', 'Gong, Minna', 'Wen, Zhonglian']","['Peng S', 'Zhu F', 'You S', 'Gong M', 'Wen Z']","[""Department of Pathology, Shenzhen People's Hospital, Shenzhen Guangdong 518020, China."", ""Department of Pathology, Shenzhen People's Hospital, Shenzhen Guangdong 518020, China."", ""Department of Pathology, Shenzhen People's Hospital, Shenzhen Guangdong 518020, China."", ""Department of Pathology, Shenzhen People's Hospital, Shenzhen Guangdong 518020, China."", ""Department of Pathology, Shenzhen People's Hospital, Shenzhen Guangdong 518020, China.""]",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

If the disease progresses into acute myeloid leukemia (AML), it is often refractory to treatment. To gain insight into genetic alterations associated with disease progression, whole exome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays were used to characterize the bone marrow and blood samples from a 39-year-old woman at MDS/MPN-U diagnosis and at AML progression, in which routine genetic diagnostics had not identified any genetic alterations. The data revealed the presence of a partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene as the only detectable copy number change and 11 non-silent somatic mutations, including DNMT3A R882H and NRAS G13D. All somatic lesions were present both at initial MDS/MPN-U diagnosis and at AML presentation at similar mutant allele frequencies. The patient has since had two extramedullary relapses and is at high risk of a future bone marrow relapse. A directed ex vivo drug sensitivity analysis showed that the patient's AML cells are sensitive to, for example, the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, indicating that she may benefit from treatment with these drugs.

We have found that the treatment of cancer cells with binase leads to a reduction in reactive oxygen species and transcription factor NFkappaB levels, and demonstrated that these effects are a common feature of the action of RNases on cancer cells.","['Burnysheva, K M', 'Petrushanko, I Yu', 'Spirin, P V', 'Prassolov, V S', 'Makarov, A A', 'Mitkevich, V A']","['Burnysheva KM', 'Petrushanko IY', 'Spirin PV', 'Prassolov VS', 'Makarov AA', 'Mitkevich VA']","['Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991, Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991, Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991, Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991, Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991, Russia.', 'Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991, Russia.', 'mitkevich@gmail.com.']",['rus'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Mol Biol (Mosk),Molekuliarnaia biologiia,0105454,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.27.1 (ribonuclease T(2))']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bacillus/enzymology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Endoribonucleases/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Ribonuclease', 'apoptosis', 'cytotoxicity', 'mitochondrial membrane potential', 'reactive oxygen species', 'transcription factor NFkappaB']",2016/05/31 06:00,2016/07/01 06:00,['2016/05/31 06:00'],"['2015/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7868/S0026898416020038 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol (Mosk). 2016 Mar-Apr;50(2):347-52. doi: 10.7868/S0026898416020038.,10.7868/S0026898416020038 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 47 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who were in complete remission as they underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with myeloablative conditioning with PBSC as stem cell source were enrolled in the study. Blood samples for the quantitative analysis of circulating EPC levels were drawn at different time points in patients with and without aGvHD. CD34+ VEGFR2/KDR+ CD133+ triple-positive cells identified among CD34+ cells by FACS. EPC were quantified and data are presented as cells/ml whole blood. RESULTS: Circulating EPC levels were not significantly different in patients with and without aGvHD prior to conditioning (baseline) and at the time of engraftment. However, at diagnosis of aGvHD>/=grade 2, EPC levels increased whereas in patients without aGvHD the EPC levels remained significantly lower (3021+/-278 versus 2322+/-195 cells/ml; p<0.001). Patients with steroid-refractory aGvHD had high levels of EPC throughout. EPC levels fell in responding patients. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that the number of circulating EPCs is increased in patients with aGvHD compared to patients without aGvHD.","['Medinger, Michael', 'Heim, Dominik', 'Gerull, Sabine', 'Halter, Jorg', 'Krenger, Werner', 'Buser, Andreas', 'Lengerke, Claudia', 'Bucher, Christoph', 'Passweg, Jakob']","['Medinger M', 'Heim D', 'Gerull S', 'Halter J', 'Krenger W', 'Buser A', 'Lengerke C', 'Bucher C', 'Passweg J']","['Divisions of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Petersgraben 4, 4031 Basel, Switzerland; Divisions of Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Petersgraben 4, 4031 Basel, Switzerland.

Re-expression of IGF2BP1 is frequently found in different tumors and has been associated with aggressive disease phenotypes. IGF2BP1 has also been identified to be exclusively specific for t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but biological significance of IGF2BP1 overexpression has not been investigated to date. We have recently reported that ETV6/RUNX1 transcript is a target of RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL suggesting a direct role of IGF2BP1 in ETV6/RUNX1-mediated leukemogenesis. To address this question we have employed stable clones of REH cells - a model cell line of t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL - with downregulated IGF2BP1 expression. Here we show that downregulation of IGF2BP1 impairs proliferation by attenuating cell cycle progression and increasing the rate of spontaneous cell death. We also provide evidence that downregulation of IGF2BP1 induce reduction of STAT3 mRNA levels and augments sensitivity to STAT3 selective inhibitor S3I-201. These data imply that IGF2BP1 indirectly potentiates ETV6/RUNX1-RAC1-STAT3 signaling axis by sustaining appropriate ETV6/RUNX1 and STAT3 transcript levels in REH cells. Further studies are warranted to specify the role of IGF2BP1 in t(12;21)(p13;q22)-positive ALL.","['Stoskus, Mindaugas', 'Eidukaite, Audrone', 'Griskevicius, Laimonas']","['Stoskus M', 'Eidukaite A', 'Griskevicius L']","['Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine Center, Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Klinikos, Santariskiu 2, Vilnius 08661, Lithuania; Department of Immunology, State Research Institute Centre for Innovative Medicine, Santariskiu 5, Vilnius 08406, Lithuania.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) has been proposed as a treatment for T-AML; however, data comparing outcomes of transplants for patients with de novo AML and T-AML are limited. Sixteen adult patients with T-AML during first complete remission after malignant disease received allo-HCT at the Peking University Institute of Hematology between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2014. Eighty patients with de novo AML were selected using the case-pair method. The 3-year overall survival and leukemia-free survival for T-AML versus de novo AML patients were 66% vs. 79% (P=0.14) and 64% vs. 77% (P=0.13), respectively. The 3-year cumulative non-relapse mortality rates for T-AML versus de novo AML patients were 13% vs. 9% (P=0.47), respectively; the relapse rates were 20% vs. 13% (P=0.25), respectively. Our results suggest that the prognosis of T-AML is comparable to that of de novo AML after transplantation.

This report describes this unique ophthalmic presentation, highlights the associated diagnostic challenges, and reviews the literature. METHODS: Two cases are described and an extensive literature review was conducted. RESULTS: A 59-year-old male with acute lymphoid leukemia, in remission for 18 months, presented with unilateral scleritis, exudative retinal detachment, and choroidal thickening. A 57-year-old male with a history of acute myeloid leukemia, in remission for 4 years, presented with unilateral choroidal thickening leading to secondary angle closure. In both cases, there was a significant lag from the onset of eye symptoms to establishing a systemic diagnosis of acute leukemia, leading to a delay in definitive systemic treatment, despite a high suspicion of disease based on ophthalmic findings. CONCLUSIONS: These two cases illustrate the fundus findings consistent with leukemic choroidal infiltration that can represent the first sign of relapsed leukemia.

Hallmarks of A-T are progressive ataxia and a dramatic increased risk of developing malignancies (25%), especially of hematological origin. In children these malignancies mainly concern aggressive Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute leukemias and Hodgkin lymphoma. Of the acute leukemias, T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is by far the most common. Since patients with A-T experience increased toxicity to radio- and chemotherapeutic treatment, the optimal treatment strategy of acute leukemia remains subject of debate. Review of literature of treatment of T-ALL in patients with A-T (n = 18) showed that many patients are not diagnosed with A-T at time of presentation of T-ALL. This implicates that physicians must be aware of symptoms of A-T in young patients presenting with T-ALL. Complete remission rates are high following upfront modified as well as unmodified treatment strategies. Treatment of ALL in children with A-T is feasible and should be performed.

Crossing the Value Rubicon in Precision Cancer Care.,132-6,"In his last two State of the Union addresses, President Barack Obama has focused on the need to deliver innovative solutions to improve human health, through the Precision Medicine Initiative in 2015 and the recently announced Cancer Moonshot in 2016. Precision cancer care has delivered clear patient benefit, but even for high-impact medicines such as imatinib mesylate (Glivec) in chronic myeloid leukaemia, the excitement at the success of this practice-changing clinical intervention has been somewhat tempered by the escalating price of this 'poster child' for precision cancer medicine (PCM). Recent studies on the costs of cancer drugs have revealed significant price differentials, which are a major causative factor behind disparities in the access to new generations of immunological and molecularly targeted agents. In this perspective, we will discuss the benefits of PCM to modern cancer control, but also emphasise how increasing costs are rendering the current approaches to integrating the paradigm of PCM unsustainable. Despite the ever increasing pressure on cancer and health care budgets, innovation will and must continue. Value-based frameworks offer one of the most rational approaches for policymakers committed to improving cancer outcomes through a public health approach.","['Lawler, Mark', 'French, Declan', 'Henderson, Raymond', 'Aggarwal, Ajay', 'Sullivan, Richard']","['Lawler M', 'French D', 'Henderson R', 'Aggarwal A', 'Sullivan R']","[""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University, Belfast, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160601,Switzerland,Public Health Genomics,Public health genomics,101474167,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Delivery of Health Care', '*Goals', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', '*Precision Medicine']",,,2016/05/31 06:00,2017/02/24 06:00,['2016/05/31 06:00'],"['2016/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['000446530 [pii]', '10.1159/000446530 [doi]']",ppublish,Public Health Genomics. 2016;19(3):132-6. doi: 10.1159/000446530.

PROCEDURES: MK-8242 was tested against the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) in vitro cell line panel at concentrations from 1.0 nM to 10.0 muM and against the PPTP in vivo xenograft panels using oral gavage on Days 1-5 and Day 15-19 at a dose of 125 mg/kg (solid tumors) or 75 mg/kg (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] models). RESULTS: The median IC50 for MK-8242 was 0.07 muM for TP53 wild-type cell lines versus >10 muM for TP53 mutant cell lines. MK-8242 induced a twofold or greater delay in time to event in 10 of 17 (59%) of TP53 wild-type solid tumor xenografts, excluding osteosarcoma xenografts that have very low TP53 expression. Objective responses were observed in seven solid tumor xenografts representing multiple histotypes. For the systemic-disease ALL panel, among eight xenografts there were two complete responses (CRs) and six partial responses (PRs). Two additional MLL-rearranged xenografts (MV4;11 and RS4;11) grown subcutaneously showed maintained CR and PR, respectively. The expected pharmacodynamic responses to TP53 activation were observed in TP53 wild-type models treated with MK-8242. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that MK-8242 drug exposure in SCID mice appears to exceed that was observed in adult phase 1 trials. CONCLUSIONS: MK-8242-induced tumor regressions across multiple solid tumor histotypes and induced CRs or PRs for most ALL xenografts. This activity was observed at MK-8242 drug exposures that appear to exceed those observed in human phase 1 trials.","['Kang, Min H', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Lock, Richard', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Maris, John M', 'Wu, Jianwrong', 'Lyalin, Dmitry', 'Kurmasheva, Raushan T', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Smith, Malcolm A']","['Kang MH', 'Reynolds CP', 'Kolb EA', 'Gorlick R', 'Carol H', 'Lock R', 'Keir ST', 'Maris JM', 'Wu J', 'Lyalin D', 'Kurmasheva RT', 'Houghton PJ', 'Smith MA']","['Cancer Center, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas.', 'Cancer Center, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock, Texas.', 'A.I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, Delaware.', ""The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, New York."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Randwick, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Randwick, NSW, Australia."", 'Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.', ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", ""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", 'Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, NCI, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160530,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*developmental therapeutics', '*pi3k inhibitor', '*preclinical testing']",2016/05/31 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2016/05/31 06:00'],"['2016/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/29 00:00 [revised]', '2016/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.26064 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Oct;63(10):1744-52. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26064.

Here, we determined the incidence of NHL and risk of second solid tumours and haematological malignancies among survivors of NHL diagnosed in Israel during 1980-2011. Data were collected from the records of the Israeli National Cancer Registry. The total cohort of 24 666 NHL-patients included 22 601 Jews and 2065 Arabs. Median age of diagnosis for Jews was 61.3 years and 48.2 for Arab patients. Of the Jews with NHL, 11 265 (50%) were of European-American origin, 5005 (22%) Asian or African and 6114 (27%) were born in Israel. Second cancers were recorded in 2010 NHL survivors, 1918 Jews and 92 Arabs, representing a rate of 8.5%, and 4.5% o, respectively. Second malignancies in all recorded sites were more frequent than in the general population, with a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.28 for Jewish men, 1.25 for Jewish women, 1.73 for Arab men and 1.98 for Arab women. This higher risk was even more pronounced for the 309 cases with secondary haematological malignancies (secondary haematological malignancies of 1.97, 1.81, 4.48 and 4.15, respectively). Our findings show that there is an increased risk of second malignancies occurring after diagnosis of NHL in Israel, particularly for haematological malignancies such as leukaemia and NHL. The differences we report in the incidence of NHL and the types of second malignancies occurring among Jews and Arabs suggest that ethnicity and genetic susceptibility may be important relevant risk factors.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present report describes the findings from a single tertiary medical center retrospective study, including the clinical features of 35 patients with NXG and monoclonal gammopathy from 2000 to 2015 and their subsequent disease course and treatment response. The median age at diagnosis was 56 years (range, 26-88 years). RESULTS: Most patients had a plasma cell dyscrasia consisting of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance in 28 patients and smoldering multiple myeloma in 5 patients; the remaining 2 patients had chronic lymphocytic leukemia. An IgG isotype of monoclonal gammopathy was present in almost all the patients (97%). The most common site of cutaneous involvement of NXG was periorbital (66%). The treatments were heterogeneous and included excision, intralesional injection, radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy. The median follow-up period was 46 months (range, 4 to 234 months). The median overall survival had not been reached at the analysis, and 80% of the patients were still alive. Eight patients (23%) had disease progression to multiple myeloma at a median of 67 months (range, 21 to 107 months), demonstrating that although the clinical course is generally indolent, malignant transformation is not uncommon. At the last follow-up visit, 80% had signs of either clinical improvement or stable skin disease.

Therefore, they have been employed in many clinical trials as cancer vaccines for patients with cancer. This review focuses on the use of DCs in leukemia patients expressing leukemia-associated antigens (LAAs). AREAS COVERED: The contribution of both stimulating vs. tolerogenic DCs as well as of other factors to the milieu of anti-leukemia immune responses are discussed. Several DC vaccination strategies like leukemia lysate, proteins and peptides have been developed. Next generation DC vaccines comprise transduction of DCs with retroviral vectors encoding for LAAs, cytokines and costimulatory molecules as well as transfection of DCs with naked RNA encoding for LAAs. Published as well as ongoing clinical trials are reported and critically reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Future results will demonstrate whether next-generation DCs are really superior to conventional pulsing with peptide, protein or tumor lysate. However, currently available methods based on nucleic acid transfection/transduction are tempting in terms of material production costs and time for clinical application according to good manufacturing practice (GMP).","['Ni, Ming', 'Hoffmann, Jean-Marc', 'Schmitt, Michael', 'Schmitt, Anita']","['Ni M', 'Hoffmann JM', 'Schmitt M', 'Schmitt A']","['a Cellular Immunotherapy, GMP Core Facility, Department of Internal Medicine V , Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Cellular Immunotherapy, GMP Core Facility, Department of Internal Medicine V , Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Cellular Immunotherapy, GMP Core Facility, Department of Internal Medicine V , Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'a Cellular Immunotherapy, GMP Core Facility, Department of Internal Medicine V , Heidelberg University Hospital , Heidelberg , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160609,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/metabolism/*transplantation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Humans', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Vaccination/methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Dendritic cells (DCs)', '*cancer antigens', '*cancer vaccines', '*gene transfer', '*leukemia']",2016/05/31 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/05/31 06:00'],"['2016/05/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/14712598.2016.1196181 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2016 Sep;16(9):1113-23. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2016.1196181.

AYAs have longer survival than that of adults for most cancers. We used the latest definition of AYAs (aged 15-39 years) and provided estimates of 5-year relative survival for European AYAs with cancer diagnosed in 2000-07, compared with children and adults (40-69 years) with cancer, and assessed survival improvements over time. METHODS: We analysed data from population-based cancer registries of 27 European countries participating in EUROCARE-5. We used the so-called complete method to estimate 5-year, population-weighted relative survival for 19 cancers affecting AYAs and children, and for 27 cancers affecting AYAs and adults. We assessed relative-survival differences between children versus AYAs, and between AYAs versus adults, using the Z test. We used the period approach to estimate 5-year relative survival over time for children and AYAs, and used a generalised linear model to model survival time trends (1999-2007) and to assess the significance of changes over time. FINDINGS: We analysed 56 505 cancer diagnoses in children, 312 483 in AYAs, and 3 567 383 in adults. For all cancers combined, survival improved over time for AYAs (from 79% [95% CI 78.1-80.5] in 1999-2002 to 82% [81.1-83.3] in 2005-07; p<0.0001) and children (from 76% [74.7-77.1] to 79% [77.2-79.4]; p<0.0001). Survival improved significantly in children and AYAs for acute lymphoid leukaemia (p<0.0001) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (p<0.0001 in AYAs and p=0.023 in children). Survival improved significantly in AYAs only for CNS tumours (p=0.0046), astrocytomas (p=0.040), and malignant melanomas (p<0.0001). Survival remained significantly worse in AYAs than in children for eight important cancers: acute lymphoid leukaemias, acute myeloid leukaemias, Hodgkin's lymphomas, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, astrocytomas, Ewing's sarcomas, and rhabdomyosarcomas (p<0.0001 in all cases), and osteosarcomas (p=0.011). INTERPRETATION: Notwithstanding the encouraging results for some cancers, and overall, we showed poorer survival in AYAs than in children for the eight important cancers. Recent European initiatives to improve outcomes in AYAs might reduce the survival gap between children and AYAs, but this reduction can only be verified by future population-based studies.

In addition to tumor-associated antigens and tumor-specific neoantigens, tumors expressing viral peptides can also be recognized by specific T cells and are attractive targets for cell therapy. Hepatocellular carcinoma cells often have hepatitis B virus DNA integration and can be targeted by hepatitis B virus-specific T cells. Here, we describe a method to engineer hepatitis B virus-specific T cell receptors in primary human T lymphocytes based on electroporation of hepatitis B virus T cell receptor messenger RNA. This method can be extended to a large scale therapeutic T cell production following current good manufacturing practice compliance and is applicable to the redirection of T lymphocytes with T cell receptors of other virus specificities such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and chimeric receptors specific for other antigens expressed on cancer cells.","['Koh, Sarene', 'Shimasaki, Noriko', 'Bertoletti, Antonio']","['Koh S', 'Shimasaki N', 'Bertoletti A']","['Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, Brenner Center for Molecular Medicine, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, (A*STAR), 30 Medical Drive, Singapore, Singapore. sarene_koh@sics.a-star.edu.sg.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Emerging Infectious Diseases Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electroporation', 'Hepatitis B virus/immunology', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell therapy', '*Electroporation', '*Hepatitis B virus', '*Hepatocellular carcinoma', '*Messenger RNA', '*T cell receptor', '*T cells']",2016/05/30 06:00,2017/12/14 06:00,['2016/05/30 06:00'],"['2016/05/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-3625-0_19 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2016;1428:285-96. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-3625-0_19.,10.1007/978-1-4939-3625-0_19 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate vosaroxin pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays to quantify vosaroxin and the two metabolites N-desmethylvosaroxin and O-desmethylvosaroxin in human plasma and urine were developed and validated. Immediately after collection the samples were stored at -80 degrees C. Prior to analysis, the plasma samples were subjected to protein precipitation and the urine samples were diluted. For both assays the reconstituted extracts were injected on a Symmetry Shield RP8 column and gradient elution was applied using 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile-methanol (50:50, v/v). Analyses were performed with a triple quadruple mass spectrometer in positive-ion mode. A deuterated isotope of vosaroxin was used as internal standard for the quantification. The validated assays quantify vosaroxin and N-desmethylvosaroxin in the concentration range of 2-500ng/mL in plasma and urine. For O-desmethylvosaroxin the concentration range of 4-500ng/mL in plasma and urine was validated. Dilution integrity experiments show that samples can be diluted 25 fold in control matrix prior to analysis. The expanded concentration range for plasma and urine for vosaroxin and N-desmethylvosaroxin is therefore from 2 to 15,000ng/mL and in plasma for O-desmethylvosaroxin from 4 to 15,000ng/mL.","['Nijenhuis, C M', 'Lucas, L', 'Rosing, H', 'Jamieson, G', 'Fox, J A', 'Schellens, J H M', 'Beijnen, J H']","['Nijenhuis CM', 'Lucas L', 'Rosing H', 'Jamieson G', 'Fox JA', 'Schellens JH', 'Beijnen JH']","['Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek/The Netherlands Cancer Institute and MC Slotervaart, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

After high-dose TBI, mice died from ""primary disease"" or bone marrow (BM) aplasia. Intravenous administration of allogeneic BM cells delayed mortality but did not prevent it. Initially the delayed deaths were said to be caused by ""secondary disease,"" which was later renamed graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). GvHD is caused by donor T lymphocytes that destroy recipient cells in skin, intestinal mucosa, bile ducts, and lymph nodes. GvHD is opposed by host-versus-graft disease (HvGD), in which host T lymphocytes destroy the administered allogeneic BM cells, including the administered T lymphocytes of the BM donor. In 1960, van Bekkum became the director of the Radiobiological Institute of the Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research TNO, Rijswijk, The Netherlands, where he built a multidisciplinary team that defined the variables controlling the outcome of a BM transplant. The team published their early results in the Journal of Experimental Hematology [1981;9:904-916 and 1956;4:482-488]. Later, protocols were established for BM transplantation (BMT) in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disease, leukemia, lymphoma, and other diseases of the hematopoietic system. This review honors the scientific contributions made by Dick van Bekkum and his team in defining the four dominant variables for improving the therapeutic ratio of allogeneic BMT and in fostering the international collaboration necessary to translate this knowledge into current clinical practice.","['Vriesendorp, Huib M', 'Heidt, Peter J']","['Vriesendorp HM', 'Heidt PJ']","['Phase2Therapy, Den Haag, The Netherlands.

The putative benefits of its combination with glucocorticoids were evaluated here. We compared the effects of dexamethasone (DXM), ibrutinib and their in vitro combination on proliferation and metabolic stress markers in stimulated normal B-lymphocytes and in malignant lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. In both cellular models, cell cycle progression was globally inhibited by DXM and/or ibrutinib. This inhibition was significantly amplified by DXM addition to ibrutinib and was related to a significant decrease in the expression of the cell cycle regulatory proteins CDK4 and cyclin E. Apoptosis increased especially with DXM/ibrutinib combination and was associated with a significant decrease in Mcl-1 expression. Treatment effects on metabolic stress were evaluated by DNA damage recognition after 53BP1 foci labeling. The percentage of cells with more than five 53BP1 foci decreased significantly with ibrutinib in normal and CLL lymphocytes. This decrease was strongly reinforced, in CLL, by DXM addition. Our data indicated that, in vitro, DXM potentiated antiproliferative effects of ibrutinib and decreased DNA damage in lymphoid B-cells. Thus their combination may be proposed for CLL treatment.","['Manzoni, Delphine', 'Catallo, Regine', 'Chebel, Amel', 'Baseggio, Lucile', 'Michallet, Anne-Sophie', 'Roualdes, Olivier', 'Magaud, Jean-Pierre', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Ffrench, Martine']","['Manzoni D', 'Catallo R', 'Chebel A', 'Baseggio L', 'Michallet AS', 'Roualdes O', 'Magaud JP', 'Salles G', 'Ffrench M']","['Laboratory ""Proliferations B indolentes"", Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5239-Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS)-Hospices Civil de Lyon (HCL), Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, France; Hematology laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL), France.', 'Laboratory ""Proliferations B indolentes"", Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5239-Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS)-Hospices Civil de Lyon (HCL), Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, France.', 'Laboratory ""Proliferations B indolentes"", Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5239-Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS)-Hospices Civil de Lyon (HCL), Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, France.', 'Laboratory ""Proliferations B indolentes"", Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5239-Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS)-Hospices Civil de Lyon (HCL), Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, France; Hematology laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL), France.', 'Hematology department, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL), France.', 'Laboratory ""Proliferations B indolentes"", Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5239-Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS)-Hospices Civil de Lyon (HCL), Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, France; Hematology laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL), France.', 'Hematology laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL), France.', 'Laboratory ""Proliferations B indolentes"", Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5239-Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS)-Hospices Civil de Lyon (HCL), Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, France; Hematology department, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL), France.', 'Laboratory ""Proliferations B indolentes"", Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5239-Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS)-Hospices Civil de Lyon (HCL), Faculte de Medecine Lyon Sud, France; Hematology laboratory, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL), France; Hematology department, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon (HCL), France.

A series of DNA ligase inhibitors with differing selectivity for the three human DNA ligases were identified using a structure-based approach with one of these inhibitors being used to inhibit abnormal DNA ligase IIIalpha-dependent repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB)s in breast cancer, neuroblastoma and leukemia cell lines. Raghavan and colleagues reported the characterization of a derivative of one of the previously identified DNA ligase inhibitors, which they called SCR7 (designated SCR7-R in our experiments using SCR7). SCR7 appeared to show increased selectivity for DNA ligase IV, inhibit the repair of DSBs by the DNA ligase IV-dependent non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, reduce tumor growth, and increase the efficacy of DSB-inducing therapeutic modalities in mouse xenografts. In attempting to synthesize SCR7, we encountered problems with the synthesis procedures and discovered discrepancies in its reported structure. We determined the structure of a sample of SCR7 and a related compound, SCR7-G, that is the major product generated by the published synthesis procedure for SCR7. We also found that SCR7-G has the same structure as the compound (SCR7-X) available from a commercial vendor (XcessBio). The various SCR7 preparations had similar activity in DNA ligation assay assays, exhibiting greater activity against DNA ligases I and III than DNA ligase IV. Furthermore, SCR7-R failed to inhibit DNA ligase IV-dependent V(D)J recombination in a cell-based assay. Based on our results, we conclude that SCR7 and the SCR7 derivatives are neither selective nor potent inhibitors of DNA ligase IV.","['Greco, George E', 'Matsumoto, Yoshihiro', 'Brooks, Rhys C', 'Lu, Zhengfei', 'Lieber, Michael R', 'Tomkinson, Alan E']","['Greco GE', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Brooks RC', 'Lu Z', 'Lieber MR', 'Tomkinson AE']","['Department of Chemistry, Goucher College, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine and Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, and University of New Mexico Cancer Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, United States.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine and Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, and University of New Mexico Cancer Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, United States.', 'Departments of Pathology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biological Sciences, and Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.', 'Departments of Pathology, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biological Sciences, and Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, CA, United States.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine and Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, and University of New Mexico Cancer Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131, United States.

To increase immune responses against the peptide antigens can be potentiated with polymer-based nanoparticles, like chitosan (CHT) and trimethylchitosan (TMC), as delivery system/adjuvant. CHT and TMC nanoparticles loaded with recombinant proteins (env23 & env13) of gp46 were prepared by direct coating of antigens with positively charged polymers. The size of CHT and TMC nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with each antigen was about 400 nm. The physical stability of NPs was followed for 4 weeks. Both formulations showed to be stable for about 15 days. The immunogenicity of NPs loaded with antigens was studied after nasal and subcutaneous immunization in mice. Three immunizations (7.5 mug antigen) were performed with 2 weeks intervals. Two weeks after the last booster dose, sera IgG subtypes were measured. After subcutaneous administration, for both nanoparticulate antigens, serum IgG1 and IgGtotal levels were higher than antigen solution (P < 0.001). After nasal administration, for env23, IgG2a levels and IgG2a/IgG1 ratio was significantly higher than groups with subcutaneous administration (P < 0.001). Both nanoparticles showed good immunoadjuvant potential. Env23 antigen was a better candidate for vaccination against HTLV-I, as it induced higher cellular immune responses, compared with env13.","['Amirnasr, Maryam', 'Fallah Tafti, Tannan', 'Sankian, Mojtaba', 'Rezaei, Abdorrahim', 'Tafaghodi, Mohsen']","['Amirnasr M', 'Fallah Tafti T', 'Sankian M', 'Rezaei A', 'Tafaghodi M']","['Student Research Committee, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.

The currently applied inhibitors ibrutinib and idelalisib have limited capacity however to induce cell death as monotherapy and are unlikely to eradicate the disease. Acquired resistance to therapy in CLL is often caused by mutations in the response network being targeted, both for DNA damage or BCR signaling pathways. Thus, drugs with dual targeting capacity could offer improved therapeutic value. Here, the potency of CC-115, a novel inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin kinase (TORK) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), was evaluated in primary CLL cells in vitro and in CLL patients. Combined TORK and DNA-PK inhibition in vitro resulted in caspase-dependent cell killing irrespective of p53, ATM, NOTCH1, or SF3B1 status. Proliferation induced by CD40(+) interleukin-21 stimulation was completely blocked by CC-115, and CD40-mediated resistance to fludarabine and venetoclax could be reverted by CC-115. BCR-mediated signaling was inhibited by CC-115 and also in CLL samples obtained from patients with acquired resistance to idelalisib treatment. Clinical efficacy of CC-115 was demonstrated in 8 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma harboring ATM deletions/mutations; all but 1 patient had a decrease in lymphadenopathy, resulting in 1 IWCLL partial response (PR) and 3 PRs with lymphocytosis. In conclusion, these preclinical results, along with early promising clinical activity, suggest that CC-115 may be developed further for treatment of CLL.

Currently, only approximately 40% of younger and 10% of older adults are long-term survivors. If untreated, the overall prognosis of AML remains dismal. Initiation of therapy at diagnosis is usually urgent. Barriers to successful therapy for AML are the attendant toxicities directly related to chemotherapy or those associated with inevitable aplasia. Organ dysfunction often further complicates such toxicities and may even be prohibitive. There are few guidelines to manage such patients and the fear of crossing the medico-legal abyss may dominate. Such clinical scenarios provide particular challenges and require experience for optimal management. Herein, we discuss select examples of common pretreatment comorbidities, including cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease; chronic renal failure, with and without dialysis; hepatitis and cirrhosis; chronic pulmonary insufficiency; and cerebral vascular disease. These comorbidities usually render patients ineligible for clinical trials and enormous uncertainty regarding management reigns, often to the point of withholding definitive therapy. The scenarios described herein emphasize that with appropriate subspecialty support, many AML patients with comorbidities can undergo therapy with curative intent and achieve successful long-term outcome.","['Ofran, Yishai', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Ofran Y', 'Tallman MS', 'Rowe JM']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel; Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel;', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY; and.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel; Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel; Department of Hematology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160527,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Cardiomyopathies/*drug therapy', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Liver Cirrhosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Myocardial Ischemia/*drug therapy', 'Renal Insufficiency, Chronic/*drug therapy']",,,2016/05/29 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/05/29 06:00'],"['2016/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34302-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-01-635060 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jul 28;128(4):488-96. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-01-635060.

Overlap forms of histiocytoses are frequent. Technetium bone scintigraphy showing nearly constant tracer uptake by the long bones is highly suggestive of ECD and a 'hairy kidney' appearance on abdominal CT scan is observed in more than half ECD cases. CNS involvement is a strong prognostic factor and an independent predictor of death in cases of ECD. Optimal initial therapy for ECD appears to be administration of IFN-alpha (and/or pegylated IFN-alpha) and prolonged treatment significantly improves survival; however, tolerance may be poor. Best alternative therapies are anakinra, mainly effective for mild forms of the disease, infliximab, and sirolimus. Cases of ECD present with strong systemic immune activation, involving IFN-alpha, IL-1/IL1-RA, IL-6, IL-12, and MCP-1, consistent with the systemic immune Th-1-oriented disturbance associated with the disease. Between 57 and 75 % of ECD patients carry the BRAF(V600E) mutation, an activating mutation of the proto-oncogene BRAF. More than 50 cases harboring BRAF mutation and with severe multisystemic and refractory ECD (sometimes associated with LCH) have been treated worldwide with vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor that proved to be very beneficial. Other recurrent mutations of the MAPK (NRAS, MAP2K1) and PIK3 pathways (PIK3CA) have been found among ECD patients. As recurrent mutations in the MAPK pathway are found in ECD and LCH on a background of chronic inflammation, we believe that both conditions should be redefined as an inflammatory myeloid neoplasia.","['Haroche, Julien', 'Papo, Matthias', 'Cohen-Aubart, Fleur', 'Charlotte, Frederic', 'Maksud, Philippe', 'Grenier, Philippe A', 'Cluzel, Philippe', 'Mathian, Alexis', 'Emile, Jean-Francois', 'Amoura, Zahir']","['Haroche J', 'Papo M', 'Cohen-Aubart F', 'Charlotte F', 'Maksud P', 'Grenier PA', 'Cluzel P', 'Mathian A', 'Emile JF', 'Amoura Z']","['Assistance publique-Hopitaux de Paris, hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, universite Pierre-et-Marie-Curie Paris 6, institut E3M, centre de reference des maladies rares auto-immunes et systemiques, service de medecine interne 2, Paris, France.

The aim of this prospective study was to analyse the impact of increasing the frequency of posaconazole administration on optimal plasma concentrations in adult patients with haematological malignancy. A total of 133 adult patients receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who received posaconazole syrup 200 mg three times daily for fungal prophylaxis were enrolled in this study. Drug trough levels were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In 20.2% of patients (23/114) the steady-state concentration of posaconazole was suboptimal (<500 ng/mL) on Day 8. In these patients, the frequency of posaconazole administration was increased to 200 mg four times daily. On Day 15, the median posaconazole concentration was significantly increased from 368 ng/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 247-403 ng/mL] to 548 ng/mL (IQR, 424-887 ng/mL) (P = 0.0003). The median increase in posaconazole concentration was 251 ng/mL (IQR, 93-517 ng/mL). Among the patients with initially suboptimal levels, 79% achieved the optimal level unless the steady-state level was <200 ng/mL.

This process is the result of careful cooperation not only among members of the Bcl-2 family but also dynamin-related proteins. These events are often accompanied by fission of the organelle, thus linking mitochondrial dynamics to apoptosis. Emerging evidences are suggesting a fine regulation of mitochondrial morphology by Bcl-2 family members and active participation of fission-fusion proteins in apoptosis. The debate whether in mitochondrial morphogenesis the role of Bcl-2 family members is functionally distinct from their role in apoptosis is still open and, above all, which morphological changes are associated with cell death sensitisation. This review will cover the findings on how the mitochondrial fission and fusion machinery may intersect apoptotic pathways focusing on recent advances on the key role played by Mcl-1.","['Morciano, Giampaolo', 'Pedriali, Gaia', 'Sbano, Luigi', 'Iannitti, Tommaso', 'Giorgi, Carlotta', 'Pinton, Paolo']","['Morciano G', 'Pedriali G', 'Sbano L', 'Iannitti T', 'Giorgi C', 'Pinton P']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, Laboratory for Technologies of Advanced Therapies (LTTA), University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, Laboratory for Technologies of Advanced Therapies (LTTA), University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, Laboratory for Technologies of Advanced Therapies (LTTA), University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SITraN), University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, Laboratory for Technologies of Advanced Therapies (LTTA), University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy. carlotta.giorgi@unife.it.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, Laboratory for Technologies of Advanced Therapies (LTTA), University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy. paolo.pinton@unife.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/pathology', '*Mitochondrial Dynamics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/analysis/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Bcl-2', 'Cancer', 'Drp1', 'Mcl-1', 'Mitochondrial dynamics']",2016/05/29 06:00,2017/01/24 06:00,['2016/05/29 06:00'],"['2016/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/boc.201600019 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Cell. 2016 Oct;108(10):279-293. doi: 10.1111/boc.201600019.,10.1111/boc.201600019 [doi],,,,,,"['(c) 2016 Societe Francaise des Microscopies and Societe de Biologie Cellulaire de', 'France.

The objective of this analysis was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of venetoclax and identify demographic, pathophysiologic, and treatment factors that influence its pharmacokinetics. Plasma concentration samples from 505 subjects enrolled in 8 clinical studies were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Venetoclax plasma concentrations were best described by a two-compartment PK model with first-order absorption and elimination. The terminal half-life in cancer subjects was estimated to be approximately 26 h. Moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors decreased venetoclax apparent clearance by 19% and 84%, respectively, while weak CYP3A inhibitors and inducers did not affect clearance. Additionally, concomitant rituximab administration was estimated to increase venetoclax apparent clearance by 21%. Gastric acid-reducing agent co-administration had no impact on the rate or extent of venetoclax absorption. Females had 32% lower central volume of distribution when compared to males. Food increased the bioavailability by 2.99- to 4.25-fold when compared to the fasting state. Mild and moderate renal and hepatic impairment, body weight, age, race, weak CYP3A inhibitors and inducers as well as OATP1B1 transporter phenotype and P-gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1/OATP1B3 modulators had no impact on venetoclax pharmacokinetics. Venetoclax showed minimal accumulation with accumulation ratio of 1.30-1.44. In conclusion, the concomitant administration of moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors and rituximab as well as food were the main factors impacting venetoclax pharmacokinetics, while patient characteristics had only minimal impact.","['Jones, Aksana K', 'Freise, Kevin J', 'Agarwal, Suresh K', 'Humerickhouse, Rod A', 'Wong, Shekman L', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed']","['Jones AK', 'Freise KJ', 'Agarwal SK', 'Humerickhouse RA', 'Wong SL', 'Salem AH']","['Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Inc., 1 N.

In leukemia cells, Ph not only impairs the physiological signaling pathways but also disrupts genomic stability. This aberrant fusion gene encodes the breakpoint cluster region-proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase (BCR-ABL1) oncogenic protein with persistently enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. The kinase activity is responsible for maintaining proliferation, inhibiting differentiation, and conferring resistance to cell death. During the progression of CML from the chronic phase to the accelerated phase and then to the blast phase, the expression patterns of different BCR-ABL1 transcripts vary. Each BCR-ABL1 transcript is present in a distinct leukemia phenotype, which predicts both response to therapy and clinical outcome. Besides CML, the Ph is found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and mixed-phenotype acute leukemia. Here, we provide an overview of the clinical presentation and cellular biology of different phenotypes of Ph-positive leukemia and highlight key findings regarding leukemogenesis.","['Kang, Zhi-Jie', 'Liu, Yu-Fei', 'Xu, Ling-Zhi', 'Long, Zi-Jie', 'Huang, Dan', 'Yang, Ya', 'Liu, Bing', 'Feng, Jiu-Xing', 'Pan, Yu-Jia', 'Yan, Jin-Song', 'Liu, Quentin']","['Kang ZJ', 'Liu YF', 'Xu LZ', 'Long ZJ', 'Huang D', 'Yang Y', 'Liu B', 'Feng JX', 'Pan YJ', 'Yan JS', 'Liu Q']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Institute of Cancer Stem Cell, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, 116023, Liaoning, P.

However, less evidence exists for solid non-CNS-tumor patients. To get a better understanding of the potential neurotoxic mechanisms of non-CNS-directed chemotherapy during childhood, we performed a comprehensive literature review of this topic. Here, we provide an overview of preclinical and clinical studies investigating neurotoxicity associated with chemotherapy in the treatment of pediatric solid non-CNS tumors. Research to date suggests that chemotherapy has deleterious biological and psychological effects, with animal studies demonstrating histological evidence for neurotoxic effects of specific agents and human studies demonstrating acute neurotoxicity. Although the existing literature suggests potential neurotoxicity throughout neurodevelopment, research into the long-term neurocognitive sequelae in survivors of non-CNS cancers remains limited. Therefore, we stress the critical need for neurodevelopmental focused research in children who are treated for solid non-CNS tumors, since they are at risk for potential neurocognitive impairment.","['Sleurs, Charlotte', 'Deprez, Sabine', 'Emsell, Louise', 'Lemiere, Jurgen', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne']","['Sleurs C', 'Deprez S', 'Emsell L', 'Lemiere J', 'Uyttebroeck A']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Radiology, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.

However, more than 20% of patients will still need to undergo salvage therapy, and most will have a poor prognosis. Determining the specificity of drugs to leukemia cells is important since this will maximize the dose of chemotherapeutic agents that can be administered to AML patients. In turn, this would be expected to lead to reduced drug toxicity and its increased efficacy. We targeted Notch-1 positive AML cells utilizing fucose-bound liposomes, since activation of Notch-1 is required for O-fucosylation. Herein, we report that intravenously injected, L-fucose-bound liposomes containing daunorubicin can be successfully delivered to AML cells that express fucosylated antigens. This resulted in efficient tumor growth inhibition in tumor-bearing mice and decreased proliferation of AML patient-derived leukemia cells. Thus, biological targeting by fucose-bound liposomes that takes advantage of the intrinsic characteristics of AML cells could be a promising new strategy for Notch-1 positive-AML treatment.","['Ono,

Genome wide association studies have linked Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 (IRF4) to the development of CLL. We recently established a causal relationship between low levels of IRF4 and development of CLL. However, the molecular mechanism through which IRF4 suppresses CLL development remains unclear. Deregulation of Notch signaling pathway has been identified as one of the most recurrent molecular anomalies in the pathogenesis of CLL. Yet, the role of Notch signaling as well as its regulation during CLL development remains poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that IRF4 deficient mice expressing immunoglobulin heavy chain Vh11 (IRF4-/-Vh11) developed spontaneous CLL with complete penetrance. In this study, we show that elevated Notch2 expression and the resulting hyperactivation of Notch signaling are common features of IRF4-/-Vh11 CLL cells. Our studies further reveal that Notch signaling is indispensable for CLL development in the IRF4-/-Vh11 mice.

Here, we show that contrary to what has been reported in solid tumors, in K562 leukemia cells elevated Sirt3 was associated with mitochondrial stress, and depletion of Sirt3 decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid oxidation, but increased the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG), suggesting an opposite role of Sirt3 in regulating oxidative stress in the leukemia cells. Notably, loss of autophagy by deletion of autophagy essential gene or by pharmacological inhibition on autophagic degradation caused a significant accumulation of Sirt3. However, induced activation of autophagy did not cause autophagic degradation of Sirt3. Furthermore, inhibiting proteasome activity accumulated Sirt3 in autophagy-intact but not autophagy-defective cells, and disrupting functional autophagy either genetically or pharmacologically caused significantly less ubiquitination of Sirt3. Therefore, our data suggest that basal but not enhanced autophagy activity maintains ubiquitination-proteasomal degradation of Sirt3 to limit lipid oxidative stress, representing an adaptive mechanism by which autophagy, in collaboration with the ubiquitination-proteasomal system, controls oxidative stress by controlling the levels of certain proteins in K562 leukemia cells.","['Fang, Yixuan',

OBJECTIVES: -To investigate whether interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) clone size at initial diagnosis of MDS is correlated with survival and whether changes in clonal fraction by iFISH are concordant with the MDS International Working Group response criteria during follow-up. DESIGN: -A tailored FISH panel (-5/5q-, -7/7q-, +8, -20/20q-, and +1/1q+), based on reported cytogenetic changes in Korean patients with MDS, was performed in 81 patients with MDS at initial diagnosis and in 28 patients during follow-up. RESULTS: -During follow-up, absolute increases in the clone size by iFISH by 20% or more, with relative increases of 50% or more, compared with previous specimens, were associated with transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (P = .001 and P = .002, respectively). Of the 28 patients with abnormal iFISH results, 7 (25%) showed discordance between iFISH and MDS International Working Group responses. Concordance between clone size by G-banding and iFISH was higher in the refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia/refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia group during follow-up, whereas the group with refractory anemia with excess blasts showed higher correlation at initial diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: -We conclude that iFISH can provide additional prognostic information and can predict the response to therapy in MDS.","['Park, Jae Hyeon', 'Kim, Miyoung', 'Kong, Sun-Young', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Lee, Dong Soon']","['Park JH', 'Kim M', 'Kong SY', 'Yoon SS', 'Lee DS']","['From the Departments of Laboratory Medicine (Drs Park and Lee), Internal Medicine (Dr Yoon), and the Cancer Research Institute (Drs Yoon and Lee), Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Cancer Center, Goyang-si, Korea (Dr Kong); and the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hallym University College of Medicine, Anyang, Korea (Dr Kim).']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/05/28 06:00,2017/02/24 06:00,['2016/05/28 06:00'],"['2016/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5858/arpa.2015-0150-OA [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2016 Jun;140(6):560-9. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2015-0150-OA.,10.5858/arpa.2015-0150-OA [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are increasing evidences that the apoptotic nuclease caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (CAD) is one of the players leading to translocation in leukemia. Oxidative stress, which has been strongly implicated in carcinogenesis, is a potent apoptotic inducer. Most of the NPC etiological factors are known to induce oxidative stress. Although apoptosis is a cell death process, cells possess the potential to survive apoptosis upon DNA repair. Eventually, the surviving cells may carry rearranged chromosomes. We hypothesized that oxidative stress-induced apoptosis may cause chromosomal breaks mediated by CAD. Upon erroneous DNA repair, cells that survive apoptosis may harbor chromosomal rearrangements contributing to NPC pathogenesis. This study focused on the AF9 gene at 9p22, a common deletion region in NPC. We aimed to propose a possible model for molecular mechanism underlying the chromosomal rearrangements in NPC. RESULTS: In the present study, we showed that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced apoptosis in NPC (HK1) and normal nasopharyngeal epithelial (NP69) cells, as evaluated by flow cytometric analyses. Activity of caspases 3/7 was detected in H2O2-treated cells. This activity was inhibited by caspase inhibitor (CI). By nested inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR), we demonstrated that oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in HK1 and NP69 cells resulted in cleavages within the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) of the AF9 gene. The gene cleavage frequency detected in the H2O2-treated cells was found to be significantly higher than untreated control. We further found that treatment with CI, which indirectly inhibits CAD, significantly reduced the chromosomal breaks in H2O2-cotreated cells. Intriguingly, a few breakpoints were mapped within the AF9 region that was previously reported to translocate with the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our findings suggested that oxidative stress-induced apoptosis could be one of the mechanisms underlying the chromosomal rearrangements in NPC. CAD may play an important role in chromosomal cleavages mediated by oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. A potential model for oxidative stress-induced apoptosis mediating chromosomal rearrangements in NPC is proposed.","['Tan, Sang-Nee', 'Sim, Sai-Peng', 'Khoo, Alan S B']","['Tan SN', 'Sim SP', 'Khoo AS']","['Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Paraclinical Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak, Malaysia.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Department of Paraclinical Sciences, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, Sarawak, Malaysia.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160525,England,Cell Biosci,Cell & bioscience,101561195,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AF9 gene', 'Apoptosis', 'CAD', 'H2O2', 'NPC', 'Oxidative stress']",2016/05/28 06:00,2016/05/28 06:01,['2016/05/28 06:00'],"['2015/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13578-016-0103-9 [doi]', '103 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Biosci. 2016 May 25;6:35. doi: 10.1186/s13578-016-0103-9. eCollection 2016.,10.1186/s13578-016-0103-9 [doi],,PMC4880972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By focusing on the anti-leukemia effects of eyes absent 4 (EYA4) gene on AML cells, we investigated the biologic and molecular mechanism associated with AML1-ETO expressed in t(8;21) AML. METHODS: Qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and Western blotting analysis were used to observe the mRNA and protein expression levels of EYA4 in cell lines. Different plasmids (including mutant plasmids) of dual luciferase reporter vector were built to study the binding status of AML1-ETO to the promoter region of EYA4. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was used to study the epigenetic silencing mechanism of EYA4. Bisulfite sequencing was applied to detect the methylation status in EYA4 promoter region. The influence of EYA4 gene in the cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell clone-forming ability was detected by the technique of Cell Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry, and clonogenic assay. RESULTS: EYA4 gene was hypermethylated in AML1-ETO+ patients and its expression was down-regulated by 6-fold in Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells, compared to HL-60 and SKNO-1-siA/E cells, respectively. We demonstrated that AML1-ETO triggered the epigenetic silencing of EYA4 gene by binding at AML1-binding sites and recruiting histone deacetylase 1 and DNA methyltransferases. Enhanced EYA4 expression levels inhibited cellular proliferation and suppressed cell colony formation in AML1-ETO+ cell lines. We also found EYA4 transfection increased apoptosis of Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells by 1.6-fold and 1.4-fold compared to negative control, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified EYA4 gene as targets for AML1-ETO and indicated it as a novel tumor suppressor gene. In addition, we provided evidence that EYA4 gene might be a novel therapeutic target and a potential candidate for treating AML1-ETO+ t (8;21) AML.","['Huang, Sai', 'Jiang, Meng-Meng', 'Chen, Guo-Feng', 'Qian, Kun', 'Gao, Hong-Hao', 'Guan, Wei', 'Shi, Jin-Long', 'Liu, An-Qi', 'Liu, Jing', 'Wang, Bian-Hong', 'Li, Yong-Hui', 'Yu, Li']","['Huang S', 'Jiang MM', 'Chen GF', 'Qian K', 'Gao HH', 'Guan W', 'Shi JL', 'Liu AQ', 'Liu J', 'Wang BH', 'Li YH', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', ""State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology, First Hospital Affiliated to The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710032, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (EYA4 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics/physiology', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Gene Silencing', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2016/05/28 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2016/05/28 06:00'],"['2016/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ChinMedJ_2016_129_11_1355_182838 [pii]', '10.4103/0366-6999.182838 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2016 Jun 5;129(11):1355-62. doi: 10.4103/0366-6999.182838.,10.4103/0366-6999.182838 [doi],,PMC4894048,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to systemically analyze the cytogenetics of Korean AML patients and to compare the cytogenetic profiles of various races to identify possible geographic heterogeneity. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 2806 AML patients diagnosed at 11 tertiary teaching hospitals in Korea between January 2007 and December 2011. The most common recurrent chromosomal abnormality was t(8;21) (8.8 %, 238/2717), but t(15;17) showed an almost same number (8.6 %,235/2717). Among de novo AML, the most frequent aberrations were t(15;17), observed in 229 (10.7 %). The most common French-American-British (FAB) classification type was M2 (32.2 %), and recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities correlated with the FAB subtypes. Among 283 secondary AML cases, myelodysplastic syndrome was the most common predisposing factor. About 67.1 % of the secondary AML cases were associated with chromosomal aberrations, and chromosome 7 abnormalities (n = 45, 15.9 %) were most common. The incidence of FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutation was relatively low at 15 %. Our study reports certain similarities and differences in comparison to previous reports. Such discrepancies call for extensive epidemiological studies to clarify the role of genetic as well as geographic heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of AML.","['Byun, Ja Min', 'Kim, Young Jin', 'Yoon,

Although mutations in a few causative genes are directly linked to key signaling pathways perturbation, a global understanding of how known cancer genes drive oncogenesis in human is difficult to assess. METHODS: We collected available information about mutated genes in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Validated human protein interactions (PPI) were collected from IntAct, HPRD and BioGRID interactomics databases, or obtained using yeast two-hybrid screening assay. RESULTS: We have mapped interconnections between 116 cancer census gene products associated with ALL. Combining protein-protein interactions data and cancer-specific gene mutations information, we observed that 63 ALL-gene products are interconnected and identified 37 human proteins interacting with at least 2 ALL-gene products. We highlighted exclusive and coexistence genetic alterations in key signaling pathways including the PI3K/AKT and the NOTCH pathways. We then used different cell lines and reporter assay systems to validate the involvement of EXT1 in the Notch pathway. CONCLUSION: We propose that novel ALL-gene candidates can be identified based on their functional association with well-known cancer genes. We identified EXT1, a gene not previously linked to ALL via mutations, as a common interactor of NOTCH1 and FBXW7 regulating the NOTCH pathway in an FBXW7-dependend manner.","['Daakour, Sarah', 'Hajingabo, Leon Juvenal', 'Kerselidou, Despoina', 'Devresse, Aurelie', 'Kettmann, Richard', 'Simonis, Nicolas', 'Dequiedt, Franck', 'Twizere, Jean-Claude']","['Daakour S', 'Hajingabo LJ', 'Kerselidou D', 'Devresse A', 'Kettmann R', 'Simonis N', 'Dequiedt F', 'Twizere JC']","['Laboratory of Protein Signaling and Interactions, Molecular Biology in Diseases Unit, GIGA-Research, University of Liege, Liege, B-4000, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Protein Signaling and Interactions, Molecular Biology in Diseases Unit, GIGA-Research, University of Liege, Liege, B-4000, Belgium.', 'Laboratoire de Bioinformatique des Genomes et des Reseaux (BiGRe), Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Bruxelles, B-1050, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Protein Signaling and Interactions, Molecular Biology in Diseases Unit, GIGA-Research, University of Liege, Liege, B-4000, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Protein Signaling and Interactions, Molecular Biology in Diseases Unit, GIGA-Research, University of Liege, Liege, B-4000, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Protein Signaling and Interactions, Molecular Biology in Diseases Unit, GIGA-Research, University of Liege, Liege, B-4000, Belgium.', 'Laboratoire de Bioinformatique des Genomes et des Reseaux (BiGRe), Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Bruxelles, B-1050, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Protein Signaling and Interactions, Molecular Biology in Diseases Unit, GIGA-Research, University of Liege, Liege, B-4000, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Protein Signaling and Interactions, Molecular Biology in Diseases Unit, GIGA-Research, University of Liege, Liege, B-4000, Belgium. jean-claude.twizere@ulg.ac.be.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160526,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.224 (exostosin-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Zebrafish']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Cancer genes', '*EXT1', '*Interactome', '*Notch pathway']",2016/05/28 06:00,2017/10/03 06:00,['2016/05/28 06:00'],"['2016/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-016-2374-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-016-2374-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2016 May 26;16:335. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2374-2.,10.1186/s12885-016-2374-2 [doi],,PMC4882867,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively analyzed 95 patients, 85 with multiple myeloma and 10 with plasma cell leukemia, receiving single or double umbilical cord blood transplantation from 2001 to 2013. Median follow up was 41 months. The majority of patients received a reduced intensity conditioning. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was 97%+/-3% at 60 days, and that of 100-day acute graft-versus-host disease grade II-IV was 41%+/-5%. Chronic graft-versus-host disease at two years was 22%+/-4%. Relapse and non-relapse mortality was 47%+/-5% and 29%+/-5% at three years, respectively. Three-year progression-free survival and overall survival were 24%+/-5% and 40%+/-5%, respectively. Anti-thymocyte globulin was associated with decreased incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease, higher non-relapse mortality, decreased overall and progression-free survival.

The presence of the ETV6-ABL1 fusion was ascertained by cytogenetics, fluorescence in-situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and RNA sequencing. Genomic and gene expression profiling was performed by single nucleotide polymorphism and expression arrays. Systematic screening of more than 4,500 cases revealed that in acute lymphoblastic leukemia ETV6-ABL1 is rare in childhood (0.17% cases) and slightly more common in adults (0.38%). There is no systematic screening of myeloproliferative neoplasms; however, the number of ETV6-ABL1-positive cases and the relative incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myeloproliferative neoplasms suggest that in adulthood ETV6-ABL1 is more common in BCR-ABL1-negative chronic myeloid leukemia-like myeloproliferations than in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The genomic profile of ETV6-ABL1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia resembled that of BCR-ABL1 and BCR-ABL1-like cases with 80% of patients having concurrent CDKN2A/B and IKZF1 deletions. In the gene expression profiling all the ETV6-ABL1-positive samples clustered in close vicinity to BCR-ABL1 cases. All but one of the cases of ETV6-ABL1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia were classified as BCR-ABL1-like by a standardized assay. Over 60% of patients died, irrespectively of the disease or age subgroup examined. In conclusion, ETV6-ABL1 fusion occurs in both lymphoid and myeloid leukemias; the genomic profile and clinical behavior resemble BCR-ABL1-positive malignancies, including the unfavorable prognosis, particularly of acute leukemias. The poor outcome suggests that treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors should be considered for patients with this fusion.","['Zaliova, Marketa', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni',

The phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is constitutively hyperactivated in MM to promote disease progression and drug resistance. While inhibiting PI3K induces apoptosis in MM and is predicted to increase tumor susceptibility to anticancer therapy, early-generation pan-PI3K inhibitors display poor clinical efficacy as well as intolerable side effects. Here, we found that PI3K activity is significantly upregulated in MM cell lines and patient tumor cells resistant to bortezomib and that the majority of PI3K activity in MM cells is dependent upon the p110-delta isoform. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of p110-delta substantially reduced myeloma viability and enhanced cellular sensitivity to bortezomib. Chemical library screens then identified a novel compound, DT97, that potently inhibited p110-delta kinase activity and induced apoptosis in MM cells. DT97 was evaluated in the NCI-60 panel of human cancer cell types and anticancer activity was greatest against MM, leukemia and lymphoma cells. Co-treatment with DT97 and bortezomib synergistically induced apoptosis in MM patient cells and overcame bortezomib-resistance. Although bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) promote MM growth, the pro-survival effects of BMSCs were significantly reduced by DT97 treatment. Co-treatment with bortezomib and DT97 reduced the growth of myeloma xenotransplants in murine models and prolonged host survival. Taken together, the results provide the basis for further clinical evaluation of p110-delta inhibitors, as monotherapy or in synergistic combinations, for the benefit of MM patients.","['Malek, Ehsan', 'Driscoll, James J']","['Malek E', 'Driscoll JJ']","['Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'The Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'University of Cincinnati Cancer Institute, Cincinnati, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CD protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bortezomib/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['bortezomib resistance', 'multiple myeloma', 'p110-delta', 'phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase', 'proteasome']",2016/10/23 06:00,2018/02/28 06:00,['2016/05/28 06:00'],"['2016/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/28 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['9568 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9568 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 21;7(25):38523-38538. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9568.,10.18632/oncotarget.9568 [doi],"['K12 CA076917/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001425/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5122408,['The authors report no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The measured signals are correlated to cell volume, membrane capacity and optical properties of single cells. For an improved signal to noise ratio, the microfluidic sensor incorporates two electrode pairs for differential impedance detection. One-dimensional sheath flow focusing was implemented, which allows single particle analysis at kHz count rates. Various monodisperse particles and differentiation of leukocytes in haemolysed samples served to benchmark the microdevice applying combined AC impedance and side scatter analyses. In what follows, we demonstrate that AC impedance measurements at selected frequencies allow label-free discrimination of platelets, erythrocytes, monocytes, granulocytes and lymphocytes in whole blood samples involving dilution only. Immunofluorescence staining was applied to validate the results of the label-free cell analysis. Reliable differentiation and enumeration of cells in whole blood by AC impedance detection have the potential to support medical diagnosis for patients with haemolysis resistant erythrocytes or abnormally sensitive leucocytes, i.e. for patients suffering from anaemia or leukaemia.","['Simon, Peter', 'Frankowski, Marcin', 'Bock, Nicole', 'Neukammer, Jorg']","['Simon P', 'Frankowski M', 'Bock N', 'Neukammer J']","['Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Abbestrasse 2-12, 10587 Berlin, Germany. joerg.neukammer@ptb.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160527,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,,IM,"['Blood Cell Count/instrumentation/methods', 'Blood Platelets/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dynamic Light Scattering/instrumentation/*methods', 'Electric Impedance', 'Electrodes', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry/*instrumentation', 'Hemolysis', 'Humans', '*Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Leukocytes/*cytology', 'Limit of Detection', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/instrumentation', 'Signal-To-Noise Ratio']",,,2016/05/28 06:00,2018/05/31 06:00,['2016/05/28 06:00'],"['2016/05/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/c6lc00128a [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2016 Jun 21;16(12):2326-38. doi: 10.1039/c6lc00128a.

Imatinib (IM), the first line treatment for CML, is excessively expensive and induces various side effects in CML patients. Therefore, it is essential to investigate a new strategy for improving CML therapy. Our immunoblot data revealed that RanGTPase activating protein 1 (RanGAP1) protein levels increased by approximately 30-fold in K562 cells compared with those in normal cells. RanGAP1 is one of the important components of RanGTPase system, which regulates the export of nuclear protein. However, whether RanGAP1 level variation influences BCR-ABL nuclear export is still unknown. In this report, using shRNA to downregulate RanGAP1 expression level augmented K562 cell apoptosis by approximately 40% after treatment with 250 nM IM. Immunofluorescence assay also indicated that three-fold of nuclear BCR-ABL was detected. These data suggest that BCR-ABL nuclear entrapment induced by RanGAP1 downregulation can be used to improve IM efficacy. Moreover, our qRT-PCR data indicated a trend of inverse correlation between the RanGAP1 and microRNA (miR)-1301 levels in CML patients. MiR-1301, targeting the RanGAP1 3' untranslated region, decreased by approximately 100-fold in K562 cells compared with that in normal cells. RanGAP1 downregulation by miR-1301 transfection impairs BCR-ABL nuclear export to increase approximately 60% of cell death after treatment of 250 nM IM. This result was almost the same as treatment with 1000 nM IM alone. Furthermore, immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that Tyr-99 of nuclear P73 was phosphorylated accompanied with nuclear entrapment of BCR-ABL after transfection with RanGAP1 shRNA or miR-1301 in IM-treated K562 cells. Altogether, we demonstrated that RanGAP1 downregulation can mediate BCR-ABL nuclear entrapment to activate P73-dependent apoptosis pathway which is a novel strategy for improving current IM treatment for CML.","['Lin, Tsung-Yao', 'Chen, Ku-Chung', 'Liu, Hsing-Jin Eugene', 'Liu, Ann-Jeng', 'Wang, Kun-Li', 'Shih, Chwen-Ming']","['Lin TY', 'Chen KC', 'Liu HJ', 'Liu AJ', 'Wang KL', 'Shih CM']","['Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Taipei City Hospital Ren-Ai Branch, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Chemical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160526,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (MIRN1301 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RANGAP1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2016/05/27 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/05/27 06:00'],"['2016/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0156260 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-04924 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 May 26;11(5):e0156260. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0156260. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0156260 [doi],,PMC4881950,,['PLoS One. 2017 Mar 7;12 (3):e0173828.

However, the current knowledge of the usage and efficacy of CM among CLL patients is limited. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of integrative Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) on the disease course of CLL and ascertain the herbal products most commonly prescribed to patients with CLL.A Taiwanese nationwide population-based study involving the use of Western medicine and CM services provided by the National Health Insurance (NHI) was conducted.An NHI Research Database-based cohort study was performed; the timeframe of the study was January 2000 to December 2010. The end of the follow-up period was defined as December 31, 2011.A total of 808 patients were diagnosed with CLL in Taiwan within the defined study period. After randomly matching for age and sex and excluding patients younger than 18 years of age, data from 616 patients were analyzed.The 2 study groups both received standard of care treatment. In addition, 1 group also received CHM. Patients who were registered as receiving other forms of CM, such as acupuncture, were excluded.Hazard ratios of mortality were used to determine the influence of CHM and the therapeutic potential of herbal products.In total, 616 CLL patients were included in the analyses. We found that the HR associated with the adjunctive use of CHM was less than half when compared to the non-CHM group (0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.55, P < 0.0001) and that treatment-naive patients who used CHM had the lowest HR. We also established that this association between reduction in HR and CHM was dose-dependent, and the longer CHM users received prescriptions, the lower the HR (P < 0.001).We supplied data from a relatively large population that spanned a significant amount of time. Our data suggests that the treatment of CLL with adjunctive CHM may have a substantial positive impact on mortality, especially for treatment-naive patients. Further research is needed to confirm whether there is a direct causal relationship between CHM and the outcomes displayed.","['Fleischer, Tom', 'Chang, Tung-Ti', 'Chiang, Jen-Huai', 'Hsieh, Ching-Yun', 'Sun, Mao-Feng', 'Yen, Hung-Rong']","['Fleischer T', 'Chang TT', 'Chiang JH', 'Hsieh CY', 'Sun MF', 'Yen HR']","['From the Graduate Institute of Chinese Medicine (TF), College of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University; Department of Chinese Medicine (T-TC, M-FS, H-RY), China Medical University Hospital; School of Chinese Medicine (M-FS, H-RY); School of Post-baccalaureate Chinese Medicine (T-TC), China Medical University; Management Office for Health Data (J-HC), China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Integrated Medicine (J-HC), College of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University; Division of Hematology and Oncology (C-YH), Department of Internal Medicine; Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine (H-RY), Department of Medical Research, China Medical University Hospital; Research Center for Chinese Medicine & Acupuncture (M-FS, H-RY), China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Comorbidity', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/05/27 06:00,2017/02/14 06:00,['2016/05/27 06:00'],"['2016/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000003788 [doi]', '00005792-201605240-00046 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 May;95(21):e3788. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000003788.,10.1097/MD.0000000000003788 [doi],,PMC4902377,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms by which Ets proteins contribute to immunity in invertebrates remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified a cDNA encoding BmEts2, which is a putative orthologue of Drosophila Yan and human translocation-ets-leukemia/Ets-variant gene 6, from the silkworm Bombyx mori. Expression of the BmEts2 gene was significantly increased in the fat bodies of silkworm larvae in response to injection with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. BmEts2 overexpression dramatically repressed B. mori Rels (BmRels)-mediated promoter activation of antimicrobial peptide genes in silkworm cells. Conversely, gene knockdown of BmEts2 significantly enhanced BmRels activity. In addition, two kappaB sites located on the 5' upstream region of cecropin B1 were found to be involved in the repression of BmRels-mediated promoter activation. Protein-competition analysis further demonstrated that BmEts2 competitively inhibited binding of BmRels to kappaB sites. Overall, BmEts2 acts as a repressor of BmRels-mediated transactivation of antimicrobial protein genes by inhibiting the binding of BmRels to kappaB sites.","['Tanaka, H', 'Sagisaka, A', 'Suzuki, N', 'Yamakawa, M']","['Tanaka H', 'Sagisaka A', 'Suzuki N', 'Yamakawa M']","['Insect-Microbe Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Insect-Microbe Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Division of Insect Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Division of Insect Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160526,England,Insect Mol Biol,Insect molecular biology,9303579,"['0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Insect Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/genetics/metabolism', 'Bombyx/*genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics/metabolism', 'Insect Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Larva/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bombyx mori', '*Ets family protein', '*antimicrobial peptides', '*gene regulation', '*silkworm']",2016/05/27 06:00,2017/09/08 06:00,['2016/05/27 06:00'],"['2016/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imb.12244 [doi]'],ppublish,Insect Mol Biol. 2016 Oct;25(5):566-79. doi: 10.1111/imb.12244.

We generated CreLacZ mice in which more than 99.9% of the cardiomyocytes in the left ventricular field were positive for 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-galactoside (X-gal) staining immediately after tamoxifen injection. Three months after myocardial infarction (MI), the MI mice had more X-gal-negative (newly generated) cells than the control mice (3.04 +/- 0.38/mm2, MI; 0.47 +/- 0.16/mm2, sham; p < 0.05). The cardiac side population (CSP) cell fraction contained label-retaining cells, which differentiated into X-gal-negative cardiomyocytes after MI. We injected a leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-expression construct at the time of MI and identified a significant functional improvement in the LIF-treated group. At 1 month after MI, in the MI border and scar area, the LIF-injected mice had 31.41 +/- 5.83 X-gal-negative cardiomyocytes/mm2, whereas the control mice had 12.34 +/- 2.56 X-gal-negative cardiomyocytes/mm2 (p < 0.05). Using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyurinide (EdU) administration after MI, the percentages of EdU-positive CSP cells in the LIF-treated and control mice were 29.4 +/- 2.7% and 10.6 +/- 3.7%, respectively, which suggests that LIF influenced CSP proliferation. Moreover, LIF activated the Janus kinase (JAK)signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated (MEK)extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathways in CSPs in vivo and in vitro. The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-bone marrow-chimeric CreLacZ mouse results indicated that LIF did not stimulate cardiogenesis via circulating bone marrow-derived cells during the 4 weeks following MI. Thus, LIF stimulates, in part, stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte regeneration by activating cardiac stem or precursor cells. This approach may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for cardiogenesis.","['Kanda, Masato', 'Nagai, Toshio', 'Takahashi, Toshinao', 'Liu, Mei Lan', 'Kondou, Naomichi', 'Naito, Atsuhiko T', 'Akazawa, Hiroshi', 'Sashida, Goro', 'Iwama, Atsushi', 'Komuro, Issei', 'Kobayashi, Yoshio']","['Kanda M', 'Nagai T', 'Takahashi T', 'Liu ML', 'Kondou N', 'Naito AT', 'Akazawa H', 'Sashida G', 'Iwama A', 'Komuro I', 'Kobayashi Y']","['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, The University of Tokyo Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160526,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myocardial Infarction/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Regeneration/*drug effects', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/metabolism']",,,2016/05/27 06:00,2017/07/07 06:00,['2016/05/27 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0156562 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-16101 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 May 26;11(5):e0156562. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0156562. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0156562 [doi],,PMC4881916,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human leukocyte antigen-mismatched allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT), alloreactive NK cells exert powerful anti-leukemic activity in preventing relapse in the absence of graft-versus-host disease, particularly in acute myeloid leukemia patients. Adoptive transfer of donor NK cells post-HSCT or in non-transplant scenarios may be superior to the currently widely used unmanipulated donor lymphocyte infusion. This concept could be further improved through transfusion of activated NK cells. Significant progress has been made in good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant large-scale production of stimulated effectors. However, inherent limitations remain. These include differing yields and compositions of the end-product due to donor variability and inefficient means for cryopreservation. Moreover, the impact of the various novel activation strategies on NK cell biology and in vivo behavior are barely understood. In contrast, reproduction of the third-party NK-92 drug from a cryostored GMP-compliant master cell bank is straightforward and efficient. Safety for the application of this highly cytotoxic cell line was demonstrated in first clinical trials.

METHODS: The imatinib resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line-K562-R, was established. EphB4 receptor expression was detected in patients and resistant cells. Cell migration and drug sensitivity were tested in the EphB4 knockdown cells and mouse models. RESULTS: The EphB4 receptor was over-expressed in blast crisis patients compared to chronic phase patients. The level of EphB4 receptor expression was associated with a complete cytogenetic response within 12 months. Enhanced expression of the EphB4 receptor was detected in the K562-R cells. EphB4 knockdown inhibited cell migration ability and restored sensitivity to imatinib in vitro and in vivo. Restored sensitivity to imatinib was observed in K562-R cells, along with increased levels of phospho-EphB4 and decreased phosphorylation levels of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. CONCLUSION: Our study illustrates that aberrant activation of EphB4/ephrinB2 may mediate chronic myeloid leukemia resistance involved in cytoskeletal proteins.","['Li, Lin', 'Xu, Na', 'Zhang, Jin-Fang', 'Xu, Lu-Lu', 'Zhou, Xuan', 'Huang, Bin-Tao', 'Li, Yu-Ling', 'Liu, Xiao-Li']","['Li L', 'Xu N', 'Zhang JF', 'Xu LL', 'Zhou X', 'Huang BT', 'Li YL', 'Liu XL']","['1.

NLCs are derived from the monocyte lineage and are driven toward their phenotype via contact-dependent and -independent signals from CLL cells. Because of the central role of NLCs in promoting disease, new strategies to eliminate or reprogram them are needed. Successful reprogramming may be of extra benefit because NLCs express Fcgamma receptors (FcgammaRs) and thus could act as effector cells within the context of antibody therapy. IFNgamma is known to promote the polarization of macrophages toward an M1-like state that is no longer tumor-supportive. In an effort to reprogram the phenotype of NLCs, we found that IFNgamma up-regulated the M1-related markers CD86 and HLA-DR as well as FcgammaRIa. This corresponded to enhanced FcgammaR-mediated cytokine production as well as rituximab-mediated phagocytosis of CLL cells. In addition, IFNgamma down-regulated the expression of CD31, resulting in withdrawal of the survival advantage on CLL cells. These results suggest that IFNgamma can re-educate NLCs and shift them toward an effector-like state and that therapies promoting local IFNgamma production may be effective adjuvants for antibody therapy in CLL.","['Gautam, Shalini', 'Fatehchand, Kavin', 'Elavazhagan, Saranya', 'Reader, Brenda F', 'Ren, Li', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Byrd, John C', 'Tridandapani, Susheela', 'Butchar, Jonathan P']","['Gautam S', 'Fatehchand K', 'Elavazhagan S', 'Reader BF', 'Ren L', 'Mo X', 'Byrd JC', 'Tridandapani S', 'Butchar JP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210; Key Laboratory for Molecular Enzymology and Engineering, Ministry of Education, Jilin University, Jilin 130000, China.', 'Center for Biostatistics, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.

However, BAP18 is an uncharacterized protein. The detailed biological functions of BAP18 and underlying mechanisms have not been defined. Androgen receptor (AR), a member of transcription factor, plays an essential role in prostate cancer (PCa) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progression. Here, we demonstrate that BAP18 is identified as a coactivator of AR in Drosophilar experimental system and mammalian cells. BAP18 facilitates the recruitment of MLL1 subcomplex and AR to androgen-response element (ARE) of AR target genes, subsequently increasing histone H3K4 trimethylation and H4K16 acetylation. Knockdown of BAP18 attenuates cell growth and proliferation of PCa cells. Moreover, BAP18 depletion results in inhibition of xenograft tumor growth in mice even under androgen-depletion conditions. In addition, our data show that BAP18 expression in clinical PCa samples is higher than that in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Our data suggest that BAP18 as an epigenetic modifier regulates AR-induced transactivation and the function of BAP18 might be targeted in human PCa to promote tumor growth and progression to castration-resistance.","['Sun, Shiying', 'Zhong, Xinping', 'Wang, Chunyu', 'Sun, Hongmiao', 'Wang, Shengli', 'Zhou, Tingting', 'Zou, Renlong', 'Lin, Lin', 'Sun, Ning', 'Sun, Ge', 'Wu, Yi', 'Wang,

Presently, clinically compliant procedures to generate relevant numbers of this T-cell population are undefined. Here, we provide a strategy for deriving large numbers of clinical-grade tumor-redirected TSCM starting from naive precursors. CD8(+)CD62L(+)CD45RA(+) naive T cells enriched by streptamer-based serial-positive selection were activated by CD3/CD28 engagement in the presence of interleukin-7 (IL-7), IL-21, and the glycogen synthase-3beta inhibitor TWS119, and genetically engineered to express a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CD19-CAR). These conditions enabled the generation of CD19-CAR-modified CD8(+) TSCM that were phenotypically, functionally, and transcriptomically equivalent to their naturally occurring counterpart. Compared with CD8(+) T cells generated with clinical protocols currently under investigation, CD19-CAR-modified CD8(+) TSCM exhibited enhanced metabolic fitness and mediated robust, long-lasting antitumor responses against systemic acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts. This clinical-grade platform provides the basis for a phase 1 trial evaluating the activity of CD19-CAR-modified CD8(+) TSCM in patients with B-cell malignancies refractory to prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Sabatino, Marianna', 'Hu, Jinhui', 'Sommariva, Michele', 'Gautam, Sanjivan', 'Fellowes, Vicki', 'Hocker, James D', 'Dougherty, Sean', 'Qin, Haiying', 'Klebanoff, Christopher A', 'Fry, Terry J', 'Gress, Ronald E', 'Kochenderfer, James N', 'Stroncek, David F', 'Ji, Yun', 'Gattinoni, Luca']","['Sabatino M', 'Hu J', 'Sommariva M', 'Gautam S', 'Fellowes V', 'Hocker JD', 'Dougherty S', 'Qin H', 'Klebanoff CA', 'Fry TJ', 'Gress RE', 'Kochenderfer JN', 'Stroncek DF', 'Ji Y', 'Gattinoni L']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Processing Section, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Processing Section, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche per la Salute, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy; and.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Processing Section, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20160525,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2016/05/27 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/05/27 06:00'],"['2015/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34306-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-11-683847 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jul 28;128(4):519-28. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-11-683847.

Paradoxically, CLL cells in patients are highly activated through BCR signaling and expand in proliferation centers, suggesting that the function of sIg signaling is rescued. Here, we find that, compared with normal naive B cells, CLL cells express a low level of total CD79b protein but normal levels of CD79a and IgM protein. Association of both CD79a and CD79b to IgM is markedly reduced. We further find that interleukin-4 (IL-4) markedly rescues CD79b and sIgM protein in CLL samples. These changes significantly enhance signaling in response to BCR crosslinking. Furthermore, we find that these changes are more pronounced in immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV)-unmutated CLL cells than IGHV-mutated CLL cells.

We hypothesized that chromosomal translocations or complex karyotypes and distinct somatic mutations may impact outcome after first-line chemoimmunotherapy of CLL patients. We performed metaphase karyotyping and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 85 genes in pretreatment blood samples obtained from 161 patients registered for CLL11, a 3-arm phase 3 trial comparing frontline chlorambucil (Clb) vs Clb plus rituximab (Clb-R) or Clb plus obinutuzumab in CLL patients with significant comorbidity. Chromosomal aberrations as assessed by karyotyping were observed in 68.8% of 154 patients, 31.2% carried translocations, and 19.5% showed complex karyotypes. NGS revealed 198 missense/nonsense mutations and 76 small indels in 76.4% of patients. The most frequently mutated genes were NOTCH1, SF3B1, ATM, TP53, BIRC3, POT1, XPO1, and KRAS Sole chemotherapy, treatment with Clb-R, or genetic lesions in TP53 (9.9% of patients) and KRAS (6.2% of patients) were significantly associated with nonresponse to study therapy. In multivariate models, complex karyotypes and POT1 mutations (8.1% of patients) represented significant prognostic factors for an unfavorable survival, independently of IGHV mutation status, Binet stage, and serum beta-2-microglobuline. Patients with the copresence of complex karyotypes and deletions/mutations involving TP53 demonstrated a particularly short survival. In summary, this is the first prospective, controlled study in CLL patients that shows a role of complex karyotype aberrations as an independent prognostic factor for survival after front-line therapy. Moreover, the study identifies mutations in KRAS and POT1 as novel determinants of outcome after chemoimmunotherapy using chlorambucil and anti-CD20 treatment.","['Herling, Carmen Diana', 'Klaumunzer, Marion', 'Rocha, Cristiano Krings', 'Altmuller, Janine', 'Thiele, Holger', 'Bahlo, Jasmin', 'Kluth, Sandra', 'Crispatzu, Giuliano', 'Herling, Marco', 'Schiller, Joanna', 'Engelke, Anja', 'Tausch, Eugen', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Fischer, Kirsten', 'Goede, Valentin', 'Nurnberg, Peter', 'Reinhardt, Hans Christian', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton']","['Herling CD', 'Klaumunzer M', 'Rocha CK', 'Altmuller J', 'Thiele H', 'Bahlo J', 'Kluth S', 'Crispatzu G', 'Herling M', 'Schiller J', 'Engelke A', 'Tausch E', 'Dohner H', 'Fischer K', 'Goede V', 'Nurnberg P', 'Reinhardt HC', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Hallek M', 'Kreuzer KA']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn.', 'Cologne Center for Genomics, and.', 'Cologne Center for Genomics, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany;', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany;', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn.', 'Cologne Center for Genomics, and Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany;', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany; and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Response in Aging-Associated Diseases, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany;', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20160525,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (POT1 protein, human)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['*Abnormal Karyotype', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chlorambucil/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics', 'Rituximab/*administration & dosage', 'Shelterin Complex', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/*genetics']",,,2016/05/27 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/05/27 06:00'],"['2016/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34331-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-01-691550 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jul 21;128(3):395-404. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-01-691550.

To establish whether the disease is characterized by glutathione imbalance, reduced glutathione (GSH) and cysteine were quantified in different organs. A marked redox imbalance, consisting of GSH and/or cysteine depletion, was found in the lymphoid organs, such as the spleen and lymph nodes. Moreover, a significant decrease in cysteine and GSH levels in the pancreas and brain, respectively, was measured at 5 weeks postinfection. The Th2 immune response was predominant at all times investigated, as revealed by the expression of Th1/Th2 cytokines. Furthermore, investigation of the activation status of peritoneal macrophages showed that the expression of genetic markers of alternative activation, namely, Fizz1, Ym1, and Arginase1, was induced. Conversely, expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, a marker of classical activation of macrophages, was detected only when Th1 cytokines were expressed at high levels. In vitro studies revealed that during the very early phases of infection, GSH depletion and the downregulation of interleukin-12 (IL-12) p40 mRNA were correlated with the dose of LP-BM5 used to infect the macrophages. Treatment of LP-BM5-infected mice with N-(N-acetyl-l-cysteinyl)-S-acetylcysteamine (I-152), an N-acetyl-cysteine supplier, restored GSH/cysteine levels in the organs, reduced the expression of alternatively activated macrophage markers, and increased the level of gamma interferon production, while it decreased the levels of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-5. Our findings thus establish a link between GSH deficiency and Th1/Th2 disequilibrium in LP-BM5 infection and indicate that I-152 can be used to restore the GSH level and a balanced Th1/Th2 response in infected mice. IMPORTANCE: The first report of an association between Th2 polarization and alteration of the redox state in LP-BM5 infection is presented. Moreover, it provides evidence that LP-BM5 infection causes a decrease in the thiol content of peritoneal macrophages, which can influence IL-12 production. The restoration of GSH levels by GSH-replenishing molecules can represent a new therapeutic avenue to fight this retroviral infection, as it reestablishes the Th1/Th2 balance. Immunotherapy based on the use of pro-GSH molecules would permit LP-BM5 infection and probably all those viral infections characterized by GSH deficiency and a Th1/Th2 imbalance to be more effectively combated.","['Brundu, Serena', 'Palma, Linda', 'Picceri, Giusi Giada', 'Ligi, Daniela', 'Orlandi, Chiara', 'Galluzzi, Luca', 'Chiarantini, Laura', 'Casabianca, Anna', 'Schiavano, Giuditta Fiorella', 'Santi, Martina', 'Mannello, Ferdinando', 'Green, Kathy', 'Smietana, Michael', 'Magnani, Mauro', 'Fraternale, Alessandra']","['Brundu S', 'Palma L', 'Picceri GG', 'Ligi D', 'Orlandi C', 'Galluzzi L', 'Chiarantini L', 'Casabianca A', 'Schiavano GF', 'Santi M', 'Mannello F', 'Green K', 'Smietana M', 'Magnani M', 'Fraternale A']","['Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, PU, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, PU, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, PU, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, PU, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, PU, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, PU, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, PU, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, PU, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, PU, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, PU, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, PU, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA.', 'Institut des Biomolecules Max Mousseron, UMR 5247, CNRS, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, PU, Italy.', 'Department of Biomolecular Sciences, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, PU, Italy alessandra.fraternale@uniurb.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160727,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Glutathione/*deficiency', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*complications/immunology/virology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*complications/immunology/virology', 'Spleen/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Th1 Cells/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Th2 Cells/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*complications/immunology/virology']",,,2016/05/27 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2016/05/27 06:00'],"['2016/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00603-16 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00603-16 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2016 Jul 27;90(16):7118-7130. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00603-16.

We recently showed that MEIS2 cooperates with the neurogenic transcription factor PAX6 in the control of adult subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis in rodents. Expression of the PBC protein PBX1 in the SVZ has been reported, but its functional role(s) has not been investigated. Using a genetic loss-of-function mouse model, we now show that Pbx1 is an early regulator of SVZ neurogenesis. Targeted deletion of Pbx1 by retroviral transduction of Cre recombinase into Pbx2-deficient SVZ stem and progenitor cells carrying floxed alleles of Pbx1 significantly reduced the production of neurons and increased the generation of oligodendrocytes. Loss of Pbx1 expression in neuronally committed neuroblasts in the rostral migratory stream in a Pbx2 null background, by contrast, severely compromised cell survival. By chromatin immunoprecipitation from endogenous tissues or isolated cells, we further detected PBX1 binding to known regulatory regions of the neuron-specific genes Dcx and Th days or even weeks before the respective genes are expressed during the normal program of SVZ neurogenesis, suggesting that PBX1 might act as a priming factor to mark these genes for subsequent activation. Collectively, our results establish that PBX1 regulates adult neural cell fate determination in a manner beyond that of its heterodimerization partner MEIS2.","['Grebbin, Britta Moyo', 'Hau, Ann-Christin', 'Gross, Anja', 'Anders-Maurer, Marie', 'Schramm, Jasmine', 'Koss, Matthew', 'Wille, Christoph', 'Mittelbronn, Michel', 'Selleri, Licia', 'Schulte, Dorothea']","['Grebbin BM', 'Hau AC', 'Gross A', 'Anders-Maurer M', 'Schramm J', 'Koss M', 'Wille C', 'Mittelbronn M', 'Selleri L', 'Schulte D']","['Institute of Neurology (Edinger Institute), J.

Autophagy is recognized as an emerging toxicity mechanism triggered by nanomaterials. MicroRNA 34a (miR34a) acts as a tumor suppressor gene by targeting many oncogenes, but how it affects autophagy induced by TNPs is not completely understood. Here, we observed the activation of TNP-induced autophagy through monodansylcadaverine staining and LC3-I/LC3-II conversion. Meanwhile, the transmission electron microscope ultrastructural analysis showed typical morphological characteristics in autophagy process. We detected the expression of miR34a and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2). In addition, the underlying mechanism of TNP-induced autophagy was performed using overexpression of miR34a by lentivirus vector transfection. Results showed that TNPs induced autophagy generation evidently. Typical morphological changes in the process of autophagy were observed by the transmission electron microscope ultrastructural analysis and LC3-I/LC3-II conversion increased significantly in TNP-treated cells. Meanwhile, TNPs induced the downregulation of miR34a and increased the expression of Bcl-2. Furthermore, overexpressed miR34a decreased the expression of Bcl-2 both in messenger RNA and protein level, following which the level of autophagy and cell death rate increased after the transfected cells were incubated with TNPs for 24 hours. These findings provide the first evidence that overexpressed miR34a enhanced TNP-induced autophagy and cell death through targeted downregulation of Bcl-2 in BEAS-2B cells.","['Bai, Wenlin', 'Chen, Yujiao', 'Sun, Pengling', 'Gao, Ai']","['Bai W', 'Chen Y', 'Sun P', 'Gao A']","[""Department of Occupational Health and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, People's Republic of China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology, Capital Medical University, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Occupational Health and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, People's Republic of China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology, Capital Medical University, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Occupational Health and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, People's Republic of China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology, Capital Medical University, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Occupational Health and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Capital Medical University, Beijing, People's Republic of China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology, Capital Medical University, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160506,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '15FIX9V2JP (titanium dioxide)', 'D1JT611TNE (Titanium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Bronchi/cytology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Epithelial Cells/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/drug effects/*genetics', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Titanium/*toxicity', 'Transfection']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2', 'autophagy', 'cell death', 'cytotoxicity', 'lentivirus', 'miR34a', 'titanium dioxide nanoparticles']",2016/05/27 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/05/27 06:00'],"['2016/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S99945 [doi]', 'ijn-11-1959 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2016 May 6;11:1959-71. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S99945. eCollection 2016.,10.2147/IJN.S99945 [doi],,PMC4866753,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to analyze whether the presence of atopic diseases and previous infection with parvovirus B19 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are associated with the development of ALL. METHODS: This case-control study was performed in two tertiary hospitals located in northeastern Brazil. The study population included 60 patients who were diagnosed with non-T-cell ALL using myelogram and immunophenotyping and 120 patients in the control group. Atopy was evaluated via a parent questionnaire and medical records. Total immunoglobulin (Ig)E and IgG levels of parvovirus B19 and EBV were measured in the serum. Logistic regression was performed to assess the association between variables and odds of ALL. RESULTS: We identified a significant inverse association between rhinitis, urticaria and elevated IgE serum levels with ALL. A history of parvovirus B19 infection showed a significant association with this type of cancer [OR (95 % CI) 2.00 (1.94-4.26); P = 0.050]. In logistic regression, the presence of atopy was a protective factor [OR (95 % CI) 0.57 (0.38-0.83); P = 0.004], and the presence of IgG for parvovirus B19 was an important risk factor for ALL [OR (95 % CI) 2.20 (1.02-4.76); P = 0.043].

Patients with HAM/TSP suffer from progressively worsening myelopathic symptoms, such as motor disability and bladder dysfunction, and may become wheelchair-bound or even bedridden. METHODS: To learn more about this rare, debilitating disease, we established the national registration system ""HAM-net"" in March 2012. We continuously obtain detailed data from enrolled patients using the registration forms and an annual telephone interview. In this retrospective study, we describe the demographics and clinical histories of 383 registered patients from all over Japan. RESULTS: Patients were diagnosed at a median of 53 years old, long after disease onset at 45. Most (55.3 %) were originally from the southernmost regions, Kyushu and Okinawa. The main initial symptoms were difficulty walking (81.9 %), urinary dysfunction (38.5 %), and lower limb sensory disturbances (13.9 %). Many patients reported frequent leg numbness and leg pain, and the vast majority required medical intervention for urinary symptoms and constipation. A median of 8 years elapsed from the onset of motor symptoms to Osame Motor Disability Score (OMDS) 5 (requiring unilateral support), 12.5 years to OMDS 6 (requiring bilateral support), and 18 years to OMDS 9 (unable to walk). Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) tasks related to mobility, as opposed to hand motions, were very difficult for HAM/TSP patients and well-correlated with OMDS. Scores on the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) indicated that physical functioning was severely impaired in HAM/TSP patients. Patients with a history of blood transfusion (19.1 %) were older and suffered from more severe disability as indicated by their high HAQ-DI scores. Patients with a family history of HAM/TSP (8.4 %) were younger and had relatively mild symptoms given their long disease durations; many (15.6 %) also had a relative with ATLL. CONCLUSIONS: The HAM-net national registration system has been an effective tool for gathering personal and clinical data from HAM/TSP patients scattered throughout Japan. We expect to conduct many retrospective and prospective epidemiological studies using HAM-net in the future.","['Coler-Reilly, Ariella L G', 'Yagishita, Naoko', 'Suzuki, Hiroko', 'Sato, Tomoo', 'Araya, Natsumi', 'Inoue, Eisuke', 'Takata, Ayako', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa']","['Coler-Reilly AL', 'Yagishita N', 'Suzuki H', 'Sato T', 'Araya N', 'Inoue E', 'Takata A', 'Yamano Y']","['Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Center for Clinical Research and Development, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan. yyamano@marianna-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160525,England,Orphanet J Rare Dis,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,101266602,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/epidemiology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/epidemiology/virology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spinal Cord Diseases/*epidemiology/*virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Blood transfusion', '*Family history', '*HAM/TSP', '*HAQ-DI', '*HTLV-1', '*Japan', '*OMDS', '*Registry']",2016/05/27 06:00,2017/11/08 06:00,['2016/05/27 06:00'],"['2016/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13023-016-0451-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13023-016-0451-x [pii]']",epublish,Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2016 May 25;11(1):69. doi: 10.1186/s13023-016-0451-x.,10.1186/s13023-016-0451-x [doi],,PMC4881005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These detection strategies are based on the unique optical properties of gold nanoparticles, in particular, the intense color that is subject to modulation by modification of the medium dieletric. Au-nanoprobes have been applied for the detection and characterization of specific DNA sequences of interest, namely pathogens and disease biomarkers. Nevertheless, despite its relevance, only a few reports exist on the detection of RNA targets. Among these strategies, the colorimetric detection of DNA has been proven to work for several different targets in controlled samples but demonstration in real clinical bioanalysis has been elusive. Here, we used a colorimetric method based on Au-nanoprobes for the direct detection of the e14a2 BCR-ABL fusion transcript in myeloid leukemia patient samples without the need for retro-transcription. Au-nanoprobes directly assessed total RNA from 38 clinical samples, and results were validated against reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested PCR) and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The colorimetric Au-nanoprobe assay is a simple yet reliable strategy to scrutinize myeloid leukemia patients at diagnosis and evaluate progression, with obvious advantages in terms of time and cost, particularly in low- to medium-income countries where molecular screening is not routinely feasible.

METHODS: We present a retrospective review of the medical records of two patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies (acute myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma) with occurrence of relapse in the testicle. We reviewed the management and outcome after treatment with bilateral orchiectomy. RESULTS: Case 1: The patient was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and treated with an allogeneic transplant. Two years later, the patient reported an increase in testicular size. The complementary studies lead us to suspect a testicular recurrence that was confirmed after orchiectomy. Currently, the patient awaits the start of a chemotherapy treatment prior to a new allogeneic transplant. Case 2: Patient with the diagnosis of multiple myeloma who started a polychemotherapy treatment without response and underwent allogeneic transplant. After five months with complete remission, there were signs of systemic recurrence, and a study for a new transplant was carried out. During the study, potential testicular recurrence was observed. After a batch of complementary tests, bilateral orchiectomy was performed and the diagnosis was confirmed. Currently, the patient is undergoing an allogeneic transplant protocol after radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Currently the mortality rate in cases of relapse of hematologic malignancy in the testicle has declined despite the sharp rise in its incidence. This is because of, as in our case, early diagnosis and the combined use of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. This has been achieved through an interdisciplinary collaboration of urologists, hematologists, oncologists and radiotherapists.","['Salvatierra Perez, Cristina', 'Valverde Martinez, Sebastian', 'Heredero Zorzo, Oscar', 'Martin Parada, Alejandro']","['Salvatierra Perez C', 'Valverde Martinez S', 'Heredero Zorzo O', 'Martin Parada A']","['Service of Urology.

Recent studies have indicated that metabolic regulation may play a critical role in the maintenance of stemness in LICs, although the detailed mechanisms are poorly understood. Herein, we provide intriguing evidence showing that a glucose-responsive transcription factor, carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP), served as a tumor suppressor rather than an oncogene, as previously described, to inhibit the development of acute myeloid leukemia by promoting the differentiation of LICs. Using an MLL-AF9-induced murine leukemia model, we demonstrated that the deletion of ChREBP resulted in the blockage of the differentiation of LICs and significantly reduced survival in ChREBP-null leukemic mice. However, ChREBP was not required for the normal repopulation abilities of hematopoietic stem cells. ChREBP promoted leukemia cell differentiation through the direct inhibition of RUNX1 or the transactivation of TXNIP to downregulate the RUNX1 level and ROS generation. Moreover, knockdown of ChREBP in human leukemia THP1 cells led to markedly enhanced proliferation and decreased differentiation upon PMA treatment. Collectively, we unraveled an unexpected role of ChREBP in leukemogenesis, which may provide valuable clues for developing novel metabolic strategies for leukemia treatment.","['Zeng, Hongxiang', 'Gu, Hao', 'Chen, Chiqi', 'Li, Minle', 'Xia, Fangzhen', 'Xie, Li', 'Liu, Xiaoye', 'Zhang, Feifei', 'Tong, Xuemei', 'Wang, Jiangbo', 'Yu, Zhuo', 'Zheng, Junke']","['Zeng H', 'Gu H', 'Chen C', 'Li M', 'Xia F', 'Xie L', 'Liu X', 'Zhang F', 'Tong X', 'Wang J', 'Yu Z', 'Zheng J']","['Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Inflammation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Tumor Microenvironment and Inflammation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Hongqiao International Institute of Medicine, Shanghai Tongren Hospital, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MLXIPL protein, human)', '0 (Mlxipl protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (TXNIP protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Txnip protein, mouse)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Thioredoxins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['ChREBP', 'TXNIP', 'differentiation', 'leukemia initiating cells', 'metabolism']",2016/10/23 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['9520 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9520 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 21;7(25):38347-38358. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9520.,10.18632/oncotarget.9520 [doi],,PMC5122394,['The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although treatment of malignant diseases with MAbs is promising, many patients fail to respond or relapse after an initial response. Both solid tumors and hematological malignancies develop mechanisms that enable them to evade the host immune system by usurping immune checkpoint pathways such as PD-1, PD-2, PDL-1, or PDL-2 (programmed cell death protein-1 or 2 and PD-Ligand 1 or 2), which are expressed on activated T cells and on T-regulatory, B cells, natural killers, monocytes, and dendritic cells. One of the most exciting anticancer development in recent years has been the immune checkpoint blockade therapy by using MAbs against immune checkpoint receptor and/or ligands. Anti-PD1 antibodies have been tested in clinical studies that included patients with hematological malignancies and showed remarkable efficacy in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). In our review, we will focus on the effect of PD-1 activation on hematological malignancies and its role as a therapeutic target. Key messages The programmed death 1 (PD1) immune checkpoint is an important homeostatic mechanism of the immune system that helps in preventing autoimmunity and uncontrolled inflammation in cases of chronic infections. However, PD1 pathway is also operated by a wide variety of malignancies and represents one of the most important mechanisms by which tumor cells escape from the surveillance of the immune system. Blocking of immune checkpoints by the use of monoclonal antibodies opened a new era in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Results from clinical trials are promising, and currently, this approach has been proven effective and safe in patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies.","['Tsirigotis, Panagiotis', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Tsirigotis P', 'Savani BN', 'Nagler A']","['a Second Department of Internal Medicine , National and Kapodistrian University of Athens , Athens , Greece.', 'b Department of Hematology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center , Nashville , TN , USA.', 'c Hematology Division , Chaim Sheba Medical Center , Tel Hashomer , Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160525,England,Ann Med,Annals of medicine,8906388,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/metabolism/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematological malignancies', '*immune checkpoint', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*monoclonal antibodies', '*programmed death-1', '*targeted therapy', '*toxicity']",2016/05/26 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07853890.2016.1186827 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Med. 2016 Sep;48(6):428-439. doi: 10.1080/07853890.2016.1186827.

Here, we tested if temporary immunoisolation achieved by conformally encapsulating the donor T cells within a biocompatible and biodegradable porous film ( approximately 450 nm in thickness) of chitosan and alginate could attenuate GVHD without compromising GVL. The nanoencapsulation was found not to affect the phenotype of T cells in vitro in terms of size, viability, proliferation, cytokine secretion, and cytotoxicity against tumor cells. Moreover, the porous nature of the nanoscale film allowed the encapsulated T cells to communicate with their environment, as evidenced by their intact capability of binding to antibodies. Lethally irradiated mice transplanted with bone marrow cells (BMCs) and the conformally encapsulated allogeneic T cells exhibited significantly improved survival and reduced GVHD together with minimal liver damage and enhanced engraftment of donor BMCs, compared to the transplantation of BMCs and non-encapsulated allogeneic T cells. Moreover, the conformal nanoencapsulation did not compromise the GVL effect of the donor T cells. These data show that conformal nanoencapsulation of T cells within biocompatible and biodegradable nanoscale porous materials is a potentially safe and effective approach to improve allogeneic HSC transplantation for treating hematological malignancies and possibly other diseases.","['Zhao, Shuting', 'Zhang, Lingling', 'Han, Jianfeng', 'Chu, Jianhong', 'Wang, Hai', 'Chen, Xilin', 'Wang, Youwei', 'Tun, Norm', 'Lu, Lanchun', 'Bai, Xue-Feng', 'Yearsley, Martha', 'Devine, Steven', 'He, Xiaoming', 'Yu, Jianhua']","['Zhao S', 'Zhang L', 'Han J', 'Chu J', 'Wang H', 'Chen X', 'Wang Y', 'Tun N', 'Lu L', 'Bai XF', 'Yearsley M', 'Devine S', 'He X', 'Yu J']","['Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Anhui Medical University , Hefei 230032, China.', 'Suzhou Institute of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Soochow University , Suzhou 215000, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160531,United States,ACS Nano,ACS nano,101313589,,IM,"['Animals', '*Graft vs Host Disease', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Leukemia', 'Mice', '*Nanocomposites', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",['NOTNLM'],"['*T cells', '*alginate', '*chitosan', '*graft-versus-host disease', '*graft-versus-leukemia', '*immunoisolation', '*nanomaterials']",2016/05/26 06:00,2018/07/31 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acsnano.6b02206 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Nano. 2016 Jun 28;10(6):6189-200. doi: 10.1021/acsnano.6b02206.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical, imaging, and pathologic findings were retrospectively reviewed in 54 patients with IMT lesions, which were conformed by biopsy or surgical pathology. Of 54 patients, 51 had preoperative computed tomography (CT) examination and 13 had preoperative magnetic resonance imaging records. RESULTS: The clinical appearances of these 54 patients had some relationship with the locations of lesions. Of 54 IMT patients, 87.0% cases (47/54) had solitary lesion. The mean long diameter of the lesions located at the sites of chest, abdomen, and pelvic regions was bigger than that of other locations (F = 3.025, P = 0.038). On plain CT images, soft tissue mass was found in all IMT lesions, except for 3 lesions that arose in the intestine tract, appearing as focal or diffuse thickening in the bowel wall. After contrast administration, all lesions were persistently enhanced; 72.7% cases (24/33) demonstrated heterogeneous enhancement with various cystic regions. Comparing the CT features with different anatomic lesions, ill-defined margin on the plain CT images and calcification were seen more frequently in the lesions of the head and neck (P = 0.010 and 0.035); however, the other radiological findings had no significant differences (all P > 0.05). Twelve of 51 IMT patients showed invasion into adjacent structures. On magnetic resonance imaging, 92.3% lesions (12/13) showed soft tissue masses demonstrating isointense to hypointense contrast compared with skeletal muscle on T1-weighted images and heterogeneously high signals on T2-weighted images; 85.7%(6/7) of lesions were heterogeneously enhanced with cystic changes. Immunohistochemistry showed that the percentage of positive staining for SMA, vimentin, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, CD68, CD34, CD99, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2, cytokeratin, Desmin, and S-100 protein were 88.9%, 87.0%, 44.4%, 59.3%, 53.7%, 29.6%, 42.6%, 28.5%, 13.0%, and 24.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor can involve any part of the body, and the clinical and radiological appearances are various owing to different anatomic sites. An ill-defined soft tissue mass heterogeneous enhancement with or without invasion into adjacent structures on computed tomographic or magnetic resonance images and positive staining for SMA and vimentin on immunohistochemical examination could suggest the diagnosis.","['Tan, Hongna', 'Wang, Bo', 'Xiao, Huijuan', 'Lian, Yanbang', 'Gao, Jianbo']","['Tan H', 'Wang B', 'Xiao H', 'Lian Y', 'Gao J']","['From the Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou University, Henan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Comput Assist Tomogr,Journal of computer assisted tomography,7703942,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Muscle Tissue/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/05/26 06:00,2017/01/31 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/RCT.0000000000000444 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comput Assist Tomogr. 2017 Jan;41(1):90-97. doi: 10.1097/RCT.0000000000000444.,10.1097/RCT.0000000000000444 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-transduction of HBZ and BCLxL/AKT allowed these T cells to grow in vitro in the absence of cytokines (Flt3-ligand and interleukin-7), which did not occur with any two-gene combination. Although transplanted T cells were a mixture of cells transduced with different combinations of the genes, tumors that developed in mice were composed of HBZ/BCLxL/AKT triply transduced T cells, showing the synergistic effect of the three genes.

However, chemoresistance and toxicity limit their clinical use. Here, we report that the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin, which displayed negligible cytotoxicity as a single agent in primary CLL cells, markedly synergizes with fludarabine and cladribine via enhanced apoptosis. Importantly, synergy was recorded regardless of CLL prognostic markers. At the molecular level, aphidicolin enhanced purine analog-induced phosphorylation of p53 and accumulation of gammaH2AX, consistent with increase in DNA damage. In addition, aphidicolin delayed gammaH2AX disappearance that arises after removal of purine analogs, suggesting that aphidicolin causes an increase in DNA damage by impeding DNA damage repair. Similarly, aphidicolin inhibited UV-induced DNA repair known to occur primarily through the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Finally, we showed that fludarabine induced nuclear import of XPA, an indispensable factor for NER, and that XPA silencing sensitized cell lines to undergo apoptosis in response to fludarabine. Together, our data indicate that aphidicolin potentiates the cytotoxicity of purine analogs by inhibiting a DNA repair pathway that involves DNA polymerases, most likely NER, and provide a rationale for manipulating it to therapeutic advantage.","['Starczewska, Eliza', 'Beyaert, Maxime', 'Michaux, Lucienne', 'Vekemans, Marie-Christiane', 'Saussoy, Pascale', 'Bol, Vanesa', 'Arana Echarri, Ainhoa', 'Smal, Caroline', 'Van Den Neste, Eric', 'Bontemps, Francoise']","['Starczewska E', 'Beyaert M', 'Michaux L', 'Vekemans MC', 'Saussoy P', 'Bol V', 'Arana Echarri A', 'Smal C', 'Van Den Neste E', 'Bontemps F']","['de Duve Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Service de Biologie Clinique, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Center for Molecular Imaging, Radiotherapy and Oncology, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique (IREC), Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'de Duve Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Aphidicolin/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage', 'aphidicolin', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'fludarabine', 'gammaH2AX']",2016/10/23 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['9525 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.9525 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 21;7(25):38367-38379. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.9525.,10.18632/oncotarget.9525 [doi],,PMC5122396,['The authors indicate no potential conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, targeting apoptosis regulators has been proven a rational approach for CLL treatment. We show that CLL lymphocytes express high levels of XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2 compared to normal lymphocytes. Smac mimetic, Smac066, designed to bind to BIR3-domain of IAPs, induce apoptosis in primary CLL cells (n=71; p<0.0001), irrespective of prognostic markers. Apoptosis was mediated by diminished levels of IAPs (XIAP-p=0.02; cIAP-p<0.0001) and increased activation of caspases-8,-9,-3. The caspase-cleavage was in direct association with the levels of apoptosis (r2=0.8 for caspases-8,-9,-3). Correlative analysis revealed a direct relationship between reduction in IAPs and degree of apoptosis (r2=0.6 (XIAP); 0.5 (cIAP2)). There was a strong association between apoptosis, IAP-degradation, and concurrent caspase-activation. Pan-caspase inhibitor Z-Vad-fmk reversed the degradation of Mcl-1, but not IAPs suggesting that smac066 is selective to IAPs, however, Mcl-1 degradation is through caspase-mediated cleavage. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed physical interaction between caspase-3 and XIAP that was disrupted by smac066. Importantly, XIAP and cIAP2 were markedly induced in bone-marrow and lymph-node microenvironments, providing a basis for IAP antagonists as anti-tumor agents in CLL. Smac066 synergized with ABT-737, revealing a mechanistic rationale to jointly target BH3 and BIR3 domains.","['Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Fu, Min', 'Onida, Francesco', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Balakrishnan K', 'Fu M', 'Onida F', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Biphenyl Compounds/chemistry', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/chemistry', 'Piperazines/chemistry', 'Protein Domains', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sulfonamides/chemistry', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'IAPs', 'Smac mimetic', 'XIAP', 'apoptosis']",2016/10/27 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2015/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/10/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['8462 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.8462 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jun 28;7(26):39458-39472. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.8462.,10.18632/oncotarget.8462 [doi],"['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5129945,['The authors have no financial conflict of interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal mutations in stem cells were found accompanying with the occurrence of MPN. It has been shown that MPL mutations (MPL W515L or MPL W515K) were involved in patients with MPN. Since tyrosine residues 625 and 630 mediate normal MPL signaling, whether them affect MPL W515L-induced myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) is unknown. RESULTS: In this study, we further tested their functions in MPL W515L-induced myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) by substituting either or both of them with phenylalanine in MPL W515L (termed as MPL515/625, MPL515/630 and MPL515/625/630, respectively). In vitro, MPL515/630 but not MPL515/625 or MPL515/625/630 retained the ability to induce TPO-independent proliferation and increase colony-forming unit megakaryocytes (CFU-Mk). Accordingly, differential activation of the downstream signaling by four mutants was observed and constitutively active STAT5 or AKT instead of STAT3 partially compensated MPL515/625/630 function. Further support this, STAT5-deficiency impaired MPL W515L-induced CFU-Mk expansion. In vivo, MPL515/630 but not MPL515/625 or MPL515/625/630 induced typical features of MPNs with high WBC and platelet counts, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and hypercellularity in the bone marrow. Surprisingly, MPL515/625 also caused hypercellularity of bone marrow and splenomegaly without any other significant features. We also observed differential effects of the four mutants on progenitors, myeloid cells and megakaryocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies have revealed distinct features of tyrosine sites 625 and 630 in mediating MPL W515L-induced megakaryocyte hyperproliferation and MPNs. Our study also suggests that MPL cytosolic phosphorylated Y625 and flanking amino acids could become targets for pharmacologic inhibition in MPNs.","['Yu, Chunjie', 'Yang, Qiong', 'Chen, Yuhong', 'Wang, Demin', 'Levine, Ross', 'Crispino, John', 'Wen, Qiang', 'Huang, Zan']","['Yu C', 'Yang Q', 'Chen Y', 'Wang D', 'Levine R', 'Crispino J', 'Wen Q', 'Huang Z']","[""College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, 16 Luo-Jia-Shan Road, Wuhan, 430072 Hubei People's Republic of China."", 'Feinberg School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Northwestern University, 303 E Superior Street, Lurie Research Building 5-250D, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.', 'Blood Research Institute, Blood Center of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA.', 'Blood Research Institute, Blood Center of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226 USA.', 'Human Oncology Program and Pathogenesis Program and Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering, New York, NY USA.', 'Feinberg School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Northwestern University, 303 E Superior Street, Lurie Research Building 5-250D, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.', 'Feinberg School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Northwestern University, 303 E Superior Street, Lurie Research Building 5-250D, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.', ""College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, 16 Luo-Jia-Shan Road, Wuhan, 430072 Hubei People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160523,England,Cell Biosci,Cell & bioscience,101561195,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'In vivo', 'MPL W515L', 'MPL515/625/630', 'Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN)', 'STAT5']",2016/05/26 06:00,2016/05/26 06:01,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13578-016-0097-3 [doi]', '97 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Biosci. 2016 May 23;6:34. doi: 10.1186/s13578-016-0097-3. eCollection 2016.,10.1186/s13578-016-0097-3 [doi],"['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA211534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4877759,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing studies have been conducted on the association of RFC1 G80A polymorphism with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) risk. However, the results were controversial. The aim of the present study was to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship. MATERIALS AND METHOD: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar were searched to get the genetic association studies between RFC1 G80A polymorphism and ALL. All eligible studies for the period up to February 2016 were identified. Subgroup analyses regarding ethnicity were also implemented. All statistical analyses were done with CMA 2.0. RESULTS: A total of ten studies comprising of 2,168 ALL cases and 2,693 healthy controls were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, no significant association was detected for allelic model (OR = 1.029, 95 % CI 0.754- 1.405, P=0.000), Dominant model (OR = 1.619, 95 % CI 0.847-3.094, P=0.145), recessive model (OR = 1.169, 95 % CI 10.764-1.790, P=0.429), and homozygote model (OR = 1.288, 95 % CI 0.928-1.788, P=0.130). However, there was an obvious association under the heterozygote model (OR = 1.368, 95 % CI 1.056- 1.772, P=0.018). Also, in the stratified analysis by ethnicity, no significant association of this polymorphism with risk of OC was found in the Asian and Caucasian populations. However, there was not significant heterogeneity between heterozygote genetic model (P = 0.15, I(2) = 33%) in Caucasian. Therefore, we utilized the fixed-effect model to merge OR value. CONCLUSION: Based on the available evidence, no association between RFC1 G80A Polymorphism and ALL risk was observed, even in the subanalysis by ethnicity. The direction of further research should focus not only on the simple relationship of RFC1 G80A Polymorphism and ALL risk, but also on gene-gene and gene-environment interaction.","['Forat-Yazdi, M', 'Hosseini-Biouki, F', 'Salehi, J', 'Neamatzadeh, H', 'Masoumi Dehshiri, R', 'Sadri, Z', 'Ghanizadeh, F', 'Sheikhpour, R', 'Zare-Zardini, H']","['Forat-Yazdi M', 'Hosseini-Biouki F', 'Salehi J', 'Neamatzadeh H', 'Masoumi Dehshiri R', 'Sadri Z', 'Ghanizadeh F', 'Sheikhpour R', 'Zare-Zardini H']","[';', ';']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160315,Iran,Iran J Ped Hematol Oncol,Iranian journal of pediatric hematology and oncology,101571320,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'G80A Polymorphism', 'Genetic polymorphism', 'Meta-analysis', 'RFC1']",2016/05/26 06:00,2016/05/26 06:01,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2015/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/26 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Ped Hematol Oncol. 2016;6(1):52-63.

In this study, we analyzed the incidence and trend of childhood and adolescent cancers in Yazd city, center of Iran between Jan 2004 and Dec 2013. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The various types of malignant tumors were grouped pursuant to the International Classification for Cancer in Children. To analyze the data, descriptive and illative statistical methods were used. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two patients with a malignancy aged less than 18 years were studied with a male to female ratio of 1.36.The mean age of patients was 9.88 (+/-5.7) years. Leukemia with the frequency of 84 (37.8%) and after that lymphoid malignancies with the frequency of 49 (22.1%) were the most common cancers. There was a low range of oscillation in the incidence rate of malignancies during this period of time (P value= 0.081). Malignancies were mostly in males (P value=0.057) but the whole process of malignancy incidence had gone toward the higher rate of incidence in females. Incidence rate of cancers types was steady.

The accepted first-line treatment is imatinib mesylate (IM). CML uncommonly occurs in the extramedullary sites at initial presentation or relapse. Here we report five adult patients with CML who developed myeloid sarcoma (MS) while on treatment with IM. A retrospective medical chart analysis was performed to identify CML patients with MS who were diagnosed and treated at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The age ranged between 21 and 36 years (median: 28.5) with a male to female ratio of 4:1. All of the patients were diagnosed with CML in chronic phase with initial treatment including IM. The median interval period between the initial diagnosis of CML and MS was 27 months (range 7 - 60 months). The sites of extramedullary involvement included lymph nodes (n = 2), central nervous system (n = 2) and hepatobiliary organs (n = 1). All patients were treated with either induction therapy or stem cell transplant (SCT) following the diagnosis of MS. The median survival was 16 months (range 1 - 72 months). The longest survival was observed in a patient who successfully received SCT therapy. IM is frequently used as the first therapeutic choice in new diagnosed CML; however, its penetration and effectiveness in extramedullary tissue is still unclear. The current report also supports the literature with less favorable prognosis of CML in younger individuals.","['Soni, Abha', 'Paluri, Ravikumar', 'Deal, Taylor', 'Peker, Deniz']","['Soni A', 'Paluri R', 'Deal T', 'Peker D']","['Department of Pathology, University of Alabama in Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Alabama in Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Alabama in Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20160525,Canada,J Clin Med Res,Journal of clinical medicine research,101538301,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'Myeloid sarcoma', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2016/05/26 06:00,2016/05/26 06:01,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.14740/jocmr2566w [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Med Res. 2016 Jun;8(6):480-5. doi: 10.14740/jocmr2566w.

We therefore investigated global transcriptomic profiling of normal human HSC/hematopoietic progenitor cells [HPCs], revealing that several chemokine ligands (CXCL1-4, CXCL6, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCL13) were upregulated in human quiescent CD34(+)Hoescht(-)Pyronin Y(-) and primitive CD34(+)38(-), as compared with proliferating CD34(+)Hoechst(+)Pyronin Y(+) and CD34(+)38(+) stem/progenitor cells. This suggested that chemokines might play an important role in the homeostasis of HSCs. In human CD34(+) hematopoietic cells, knockdown of CXCL4 or pharmacologic inhibition of the chemokine receptor CXCR2, significantly decreased cell viability and colony forming cell (CFC) potential. Studies on Cxcr2(-/-) mice demonstrated enhanced BM and spleen cellularity, with significantly increased numbers of HSCs, hematopoietic progenitor cell-1 (HPC-1), HPC-2, and Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) subpopulations. Cxcr2(-/-) stem/progenitor cells showed reduced self-renewal capacity as measured in serial transplantation assays. Parallel studies on Cxcl4 demonstrated reduced numbers of CFC in primary and secondary assays following knockdown in murine c-Kit(+) cells, and Cxcl4(-/-) mice showed a decrease in HSC and reduced self-renewal capacity after secondary transplantation. These data demonstrate that the CXCR2 network and CXCL4 play a role in the maintenance of normal HSC/HPC cell fates, including survival and self-renewal.","['Sinclair, Amy', 'Park, Laura', 'Shah, Mansi', 'Drotar, Mark', 'Calaminus, Simon', 'Hopcroft, Lisa E M', 'Kinstrie, Ross', 'Guitart, Amelie V', 'Dunn, Karen', 'Abraham, Sheela A', 'Sansom, Owen', 'Michie, Alison M', 'Machesky, Laura', 'Kranc, Kamil R', 'Graham, Gerard J', 'Pellicano, Francesca', 'Holyoake, Tessa L']","['Sinclair A', 'Park L', 'Shah M', 'Drotar M', 'Calaminus S', 'Hopcroft LE', 'Kinstrie R', 'Guitart AV', 'Dunn K', 'Abraham SA', 'Sansom O', 'Michie AM', 'Machesky L', 'Kranc KR', 'Graham GJ', 'Pellicano F', 'Holyoake TL']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom;"", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom;"", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom;"", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom;"", 'Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Research, University of Hull, Hull, United Kingdom;', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom;"", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom;"", 'Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom;"", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom;"", 'Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom;"", 'Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, United Kingdom; and.', 'Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom;', 'Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom;"", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom;""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160524,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8B)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Platelet Factor 4/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology/metabolism']",,,2016/05/26 06:00,2017/08/05 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2015/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34329-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-08-661785 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Jul 21;128(3):371-83. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-08-661785.

Patients received IV ofatumumab (cycle 1: 300 mg day 1 and 1,000 mg day 8; cycles 2-6: 1,000 mg on day 1 every 28 days) and IV bendamustine 90 mg m(-2) (previously untreated) or 70 mg m(-2) (relapsed) on days 1 and 2 of each 28-day cycle, for up to 6 cycles. Forty-four previously untreated and 53 relapsed patients were enrolled. Median age was 62.5 years (previously untreated) and 68 years (relapsed); relapsed patients had received a median of 1 (range 1-11) prior therapy. The investigator-assessed overall response rate was 95% (43% complete response [CR]) for the previously untreated, and 74% (11% CR) for the relapsed patients. The regimen was well tolerated with 89% (previously untreated) and 85% (relapsed patients) receiving all 6 cycles. No unexpected toxicities were reported. Grade 3/4 events occurred in 57% of previously untreated, and 72% of relapsed patients. At approximately 29 months' follow-up, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached for the previously untreated population, and the 28-month PFS estimate was 72.3%. The median PFS for the relapsed population was 22.5 months (95% CI: 14.0-27.3 months).

We aimed to systematically review studies assessing validity of self-reported family history for the remaining cancer sites. We searched the Medline database for relevant studies published by January 2016. We extracted information on the study design and the positive predictive value (PPV) of self-reported FHC, defined as the proportion of reported cancer diagnoses among relatives that was confirmed by a reference standard (as a measure of over-reporting). We also extracted information on sensitivity of self-reported FHC (as a measure of underreporting). Overall, 21 studies were included that provided information on the PPV of self-reported FHC for relevant cancers and four studies also provided information on sensitivity. The PPV was highest (mostly >70%) for pancreatic, lung, thyroid and urinary system cancers and for leukemia and lymphoma, while it was lowest for stomach and liver cancer. Sensitivity was highest (>70%) for pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, melanoma, leukemia and lymphoma. For several cancers, sample sizes were low and the number of studies limited, particularly regarding sensitivity of self-reported FHC. In conclusion, for some cancers (e.g., pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, lymphoma) self-reported FHC can be considered sufficiently valid to be useful, for example, in preventive counseling. For several cancers, it is not sufficiently studied or the pattern is inconsistent. This needs to be taken into account when using self-reported information about FHC in clinical practice or epidemiological research.","['Fiederling, Jonas', 'Shams, Ahmad Zia', 'Haug, Ulrike']","['Fiederling J', 'Shams AZ', 'Haug U']","['Epidemiological Cancer Registry Baden-Wuerttemberg, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Epidemiological Cancer Registry Baden-Wuerttemberg, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology - BIPS, Bremen, Germany.', 'Faculty of Human and Health Sciences, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160623,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Humans', 'Medical History Taking/methods/*standards', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Self Report/*standards']",['NOTNLM'],"['*accuracy', '*cancer', '*family history', '*self-report', '*validity']",2016/05/26 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2015/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.30203 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2016 Oct 1;139(7):1449-60. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30203.

HL-60 cells were transfected by a eukaryotic expression vector pReceiver-M29-DAPK via LipofectamineTM 2000, and the impact of DAPK overexpression on cell apoptosis, cell cycle, cell differentiation and caspase-3 expression were analyzed. RESULTS: DAPK mRNA expression was positive in K562, Molt4 and U937 cells but negative in HL-60 cells. Significantly increased cell apoptosis was observed in pReceiver-M29-DAPK-transfected HL-60 cells by flow cytometry and Hoechst33342 staining. The cell cycle distribution and differentiation showed no significant changes after the transfection. The expression of caspase-3 was significantly increased in the cells after transfection. CONCLUSION: DAPK gene overexpression promotes apoptosis of HL-60 cells without affecting the cell cycle and differentiation.

We previously showed that the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R or P2RX7) is overexpressed in circulating lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. In the present study we investigated the P2X7R/NLRP3 inflammasome axis in lymphocytes from a cohort of 23 CLL patients. P2X7R, ASC and NLRP3 were investigated by Western blot, PCR and transfection techniques. P2X7R was overexpressed and correlated with chromosome 12 trisomy in CLL patients. ASC mRNA and protein were also overexpressed. On the contrary, NLRP3 was dramatically down-modulated in CLL lymphocytes relative to lymphocytes from healthy donors. To further investigate the correlation between P2X7R, NLRP3 and cell growth, NLRP3 was silenced in THP-1 cells, a leukemic cell line that natively expresses both NLRP3 and P2X7R. NLRP3 silencing enhanced P2X7R expression and promoted growth. On the contrary, NLRP3 overexpression caused accelerated apoptosis. The P2X7R was also up-modulated in hematopoietic cells from NLRP3-KO mice. In conclusion, we show that NLRP3 down-modulation stimulates P2X7R expression and promotes growth, while NLRP3 overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and stimulates apoptosis. These findings suggest that NLRP3 is a negative regulator of growth and point to a role of the P2X7R/NLRP3 axis in CLL.","['Salaro, Erica', 'Rambaldi, Alessia', 'Falzoni, Simonetta', 'Amoroso, Francesca Saveria', 'Franceschini, Alessia', 'Sarti, Alba Clara', 'Bonora, Massimo', 'Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Ciccone, Maria', 'Audrito, Valentina', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Pelegrin, Pablo', 'Pinton, Paolo', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Di Virgilio, Francesco']","['Salaro E', 'Rambaldi A', 'Falzoni S', 'Amoroso FS', 'Franceschini A', 'Sarti AC', 'Bonora M', 'Cavazzini F', 'Rigolin GM', 'Ciccone M', 'Audrito V', 'Deaglio S', 'Pelegrin P', 'Pinton P', 'Cuneo A', 'Di Virgilio F']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Section of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Section of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Section of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Immunogenetics Unit, Human Genetics Foundation, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Immunogenetics Unit, Human Genetics Foundation, Torino, Italy.', 'Murcia Biomedical Research Institute (IMIB), Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca, 30120 Murcia, Spain.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Section of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Section of Pathology, Oncology and Experimental Biology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160525,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Inflammasomes)', '0 (NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein)', '0 (NLRP3 protein, human)', '0 (Nlrp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (P2RX7 protein, human)', '0 (PYCARD protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X7)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inflammasomes/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Middle Aged', 'NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X7/*metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells']",,,2016/05/26 06:00,2018/04/03 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2015/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['srep26280 [pii]', '10.1038/srep26280 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 May 25;6:26280. doi: 10.1038/srep26280.,10.1038/srep26280 [doi],['614578/European Research Council/International'],PMC4879576,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has distinctive clinical and biological features. In respect to adult ALL, available data from Pakistan are limited. Therefore we reviewed the demographical and clinico- hematological profiles along with FAB stratification of adult patients with ALL presented at our hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross sectional study, 51 adults (>/=15 years) patients with ALL were enrolled from January 2010 to December 2014. RESULTS: The mean age was 23.8+/-12.9 years with the median age of 18.0 years. The male to female ratio was 2:1. The major complaints were fever (60.7%), generalized weakness (47.0%), overt bleeding (19.6%) and weight loss (13.7%). Physical examination revealed lymphodenopathy as a predominant finding detected in 43.1% followed by splenomegaly and hepatomegaly in 23.5% and 21.5%, respectively. The mean hemoglobin level was 9.0+/-2.75g/dl with a mean MCV of 82.2+/-15.4 fl, a mean total leukocyte count of 31.1+/-64.0x109/l, a mean ANC of 2.1+/-3.0 x109/l and a mean platelet count of 71.7+/-85.7x109/l. According to FAB classification, 47.1% were L1 type, 45.1% L2 and 7.8% L3 variant. CONCLUSIONS: Clinico-pathological features appeared comparable to published data. Febrile illness associated with lymphodenopathy was the commonest presentation. FAB classification revealed a predominance of ALL-L1 variant in Pakistani adult patients with ALL.","['Sultan, Sadia', 'Irfan, Syed Mohammed', 'Parveen, Saira', 'Mustafa, Sanober']","['Sultan S', 'Irfan SM', 'Parveen S', 'Mustafa S']","['Department of Hematology and Blood bank, Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan E-mail : sadiasultan96@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/classification/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pakistan/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/05/26 06:00,2017/01/27 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2016.17.4.2307 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(4):2307-9. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2016.17.4.2307.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymorphisms affecting microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis or mRNA:miRNA interactions are important risk factors in the development of different types of cancer. Thus, we carried out a case-control study to test the association with CML susceptibility of gene variants located in the miRNA machinery genes AGO1 (rs636832) and GEMIN4 (rs2740348), as well as in the miRNA binding sites of the genes BRCA1 (rs799917) and KRAS (rs61764370). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the genotype of 781 Mexican-Mestizo individuals (469 healthy subjects and 312 CML cases) for the four polymorphisms using TaqMan probes to test the association with CML susceptibility. RESULTS: We found a borderline association of the minor homozygote genotype of the KRAS_rs61764370 polymorphism with an increased risk for CML susceptibility (P = 0.06). After gender stratification, this association was significant only for women (odds ratio [OR] = 13.41, P = 0.04). The distribution of the allelic and genotypic frequencies of the four studied SNPs was neither associated with advanced phases of CML nor treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show a significant association of the KRAS_rs61764370 SNP with CML. To further determine such an association of with CML susceptibility, our results must be replicated in different ethnic groups.","['Gutierrez-Malacatt, Humberto', 'Ayala-Sanchez, Manuel', 'Aquino-Ortega, Xochitl', 'Dominguez-Rodriguez, Jacqueline', 'Martinez-Tovar, Adolfo', 'Olarte-Carrillo, Irma', 'Martinez-Hernandez, Angelica', 'C, Cecilia Contreras-Cubas', 'Orozco, Lorena', 'Cordova, Emilio J']","['Gutierrez-Malacatt H', 'Ayala-Sanchez M', 'Aquino-Ortega X', 'Dominguez-Rodriguez J', 'Martinez-Tovar A', 'Olarte-Carrillo I', 'Martinez-Hernandez A', 'C CC', 'Orozco L', 'Cordova EJ']","['Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, SS, Mexico, D.F.

The success of the treatment of this form of leukemia with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is monitored by reduction of the Ph chromosome. OBJECTIVE: To compare the role of conventional cytogenetic (CC) methods with a real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of CML patients. The secondary outcome was to analyze the treatment responses to TKI in CML patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of CML patients who attended the Hematology clinic at Chiang Mai University Hospital from 2005-2010. Medical records were reviewed for demographic data, risk score, treatment response and the results of CC methods, FISH and RQ-PCR. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty three cases were included in the study, 57.7% of whom were male with a mean age of 46.9 years. Most of the patients registered as intermediate to high risk on the Sokal score. At diagnosis, 121 patients were tested using the CC method and 118 (95.9%) were identified as positive. Five patients failed to be diagnosed by CC methods but were positive for BCR-ABL1 using the FISH method. Imatinib was the first-line treatment used in 120 patients (97.6%). In most patients (108 out of 122, 88.5%), a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was achieved after TKI therapy and in 86 patients (70.5%) CCyR was achieved long term by the CC method. Five out of the 35 analyzed patients in which CCyR was achieved by the CC method had a positive FISH result. Out of the 76 patients in which CCyR was achieved, RQ-PCR classified patients to only CCyR in 17 patients (22.4%) with a deeper major molecular response (MMR) in 4 patients (5.3%) and complete molecular response (CMR) in 55 patients (72.4%). In the case of initial therapy, CCyR was achieved in 95 patients (79.1%) who received imatinib and in both patients who received dasatinib (100%). For the second line treatment, nilotinib were used in 30 patients and in 19 of them (63.3%) CCyR was achieved. In half of the 6 patients (50%) who received dasatinib as second line or third line treatment CCyR was also achieved. CONCLUSIONS: CML patients had a good response to TKI treatment. FISH could be useful for diagnosis in cases where CC analysis failed to detect the Ph chromosome. RQ-PCR was helpful in detecting any residual disease and determining the depth of the treatment response at levels greater than the CC methods.","['Tantiworawit, Adisak', 'Kongjarern, Supanat', 'Rattarittamrong, Ekarat', 'Lekawanvijit, Suree', 'Bumroongkit, Kanokkan', 'Boonma, Nonglak', 'Rattanathammethee, Thanawat', 'Hantrakool, Sasinee', 'Chai-Adisaksopha, Chatree', 'Norasetthada, Lalita']","['Tantiworawit A', 'Kongjarern S', 'Rattarittamrong E', 'Lekawanvijit S', 'Bumroongkit K', 'Boonma N', 'Rattanathammethee T', 'Hantrakool S', 'Chai-Adisaksopha C', 'Norasetthada L']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Thailand E-mail : ekarat_r@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Philadelphia Chromosome/*drug effects', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/05/26 06:00,2017/01/27 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2016.17.4.2159 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(4):2159-64. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2016.17.4.2159.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A dual diagnostic and follow up approach was applied including cytogenetic demonstration of the t(15;17) translocation and detection of PML-RARalpha chimeric transcripts by molecular means. PURPOSE: Conventional cytogenetics involving bone marrow is beset with high probability of poor metaphase index and was substituted with phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced peripheral blood culture based cytogenetic analysis as a diagnostic and follow up modality in APML patients of Kashmir (North India). Both qualitative (RT-PCR) and quantitative (Q-PCR) tests were simultaneously carried out to authenticate the modified cytogenetics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient samples were subjected to the said techniques to establish their baseline as well as follow-up status. RESULTS: Initial cytogenetics revealed 30 patients (81%) positive for t(15;17) whereas 7 (19%) had either cryptic translocation or were negative for t(15;17). Two cases had chromosome 16q deletion and no hallmark translocation t(15;17). Q-PCR status for PML-RARalpha was found to be positive for all patients. All the APML patients were reassessed at the end of consolidation phase and during maintenance phase of chemotherapy where 6 patients had molecular relapse, wherein 4 also demonstrated cytogenetic relapse. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that PHA-induced peripheral blood cytogenetics along with molecular analysis could prove a reliable modality in the diagnosis and assessment of follow up response of APML patients.","['Baba, Shahid M', 'Azad, Niyaz A', 'Shah, Zaffar A', 'Afroze, Dil', 'Pandith, Arshad A', 'Jan, Aleem', 'Aziz, Sheikh A', 'Dar, Fayaz A']","['Baba SM', 'Azad NA', 'Shah ZA', 'Afroze D', 'Pandith AA', 'Jan A', 'Aziz SA', 'Dar FA']","['Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Srinagar, J and K, India E-mail : bshahid007@gmail.com, zaffaramin@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Blood Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'India', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",,,2016/05/26 06:00,2017/02/01 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2016.17.4.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(4):1999-2006. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2016.17.4.1999.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical significance of smudge cells in other hematological malignancies, solid tumors or non-malignant diseases is less clear. Hence, this study was conducted to survey the clinical significance of smudge cells in hematological cancers and other disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January to November, 2015, the clinical data of patients who received blood examination with differential counts for clinical purpose and were found to have smudge cells in the peripheral blood film in Far Eastern Memorial Hospital were selected. The percentage of smudge cells and patient outcomes were evaluated for further univariate and survival analyses. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients with smudge cells in their blood smears were included. Smudge cells were frequently presented in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA; n=30), infections (n=23), hematological cancers (n=23) and solid cancers (n=10). There was no relationship between the percentage of smudge cells and the patient mortality in all diseases (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.47-2.48, P=1.000) as well as the OHCA group (OR: 1.91, 95% CI: 0.38-9.60, P=0.694). It was observed that in patients with all cancers with the percentage of smudge cells less than 50% had a lower mortality rate in comparison with those who had the percentage of smudge cells of 50% or more (OR: 22.29, 95% CI: 2.38-208.80, <0.001). Additionally, it was seemingly that patients with smudge cells of 50% or more had a lower survival rate than those with smudge cells less than 50% in all cancers with follow-up at 2-month intervals, but without statistical significance (P=0.064). CONCLUSIONS: Our survey indicated that in all cancers, those who had higher percentage of smudge cells were prone to have poor outcomes when compared with the subjects with lower percentage of smudge cells. This finding was quite different from the results of previous studies in which the race-ethnicity of most study populations was non-Asian; hence, further investigations are required. Besides, there was no apparent association of the percentage of smudge cells with patient outcomes in all diseases, including OHCA.","['Chang, Chih-Chun', 'Sun, Jen-Tang', 'Liou, Tse-Hsuan', 'Kuo, Chin-Fu', 'Bei, Chia-Hao', 'Lin, Sheng-Jun', 'Tsai, Wei-Ting', 'Tan, N-Chi', 'Liou, Ching-Biau', 'Su, Ming-Jang', 'Yen, Tzung-Hai', 'Chu, Fang-Yeh']","['Chang CC', 'Sun JT', 'Liou TH', 'Kuo CF', 'Bei CH', 'Lin SJ', 'Tsai WT', 'Tan NC', 'Liou CB', 'Su MJ', 'Yen TH', 'Chu FY']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, 2Department of Emergency, Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, New Taipei, Taiwan E-mail : jacpha@mail.femh.org.tw.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blood Cells/*pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Arrest/*pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infections/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",,,2016/05/26 06:00,2017/01/25 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2016.17.4.1847 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016;17(4):1847-50. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2016.17.4.1847.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phase I study assessed the disposition, elimination, and safety of (14)C-omacetaxine in patients with solid tumors. Methods The study comprised a 7-days pharmacokinetic assessment followed by a treatment period of </= six 28-days cycles. A single subcutaneous dose of 1.25 mg/m(2) (14)C-omacetaxine was administered to six patients. Blood, urine, and feces were collected through 168 h or until radioactivity excreted within 24 h was <1 % of the dose. Total radioactivity (TRA) was measured in all matrices and concentrations of omacetaxine, 4'-desmethylhomoharringtonine (4'-DMHHT), and cephalotaxine were measured in plasma and urine. For each treatment cycle, patients received 1.25 mg/m(2) omacetaxine twice daily for 7 days. Results Mean TRA recovered was approximately 81 % of the dose, with approximately half of the radioactivity recovered in feces and half in urine. Approximately 20 % of the dose was excreted unchanged in urine; cephalotaxine (0.4 % of dose) and 4' DMHHT (9 %) were also present. Plasma concentrations of TRA were higher than the sum of omacetaxine and known metabolites, suggesting the presence of other (14)C-omacetaxine-derived compounds. Fatigue and anemia were common, consistent with the known toxicity profile of omacetaxine. Conclusion Renal and hepatic processes contribute to the elimination of (14)C-omacetaxine-derived radioactivity in cancer patients. In addition to omacetaxine and its known metabolites, other (14)C-omacetaxine-derived materials appear to be present in plasma and urine. Omacetaxine was adequately tolerated, with no new safety signals.","['Nijenhuis, Cynthia M', 'Hellriegel, Edward', 'Beijnen, Jos H', 'Hershock, Diane', 'Huitema, Alwin D R', 'Lucas, Luc', 'Mergui-Roelvink, Marja', 'Munteanu, Mihaela', 'Rabinovich-Guilatt, Laura', 'Robertson, Philmore Jr', 'Rosing, Hilde', 'Spiegelstein, Ofer', 'Schellens, Jan H M']","['Nijenhuis CM', 'Hellriegel E', 'Beijnen JH', 'Hershock D', 'Huitema AD', 'Lucas L', 'Mergui-Roelvink M', 'Munteanu M', 'Rabinovich-Guilatt L', 'Robertson P Jr', 'Rosing H', 'Spiegelstein O', 'Schellens JH']","['Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek/The Netherlands Cancer Institute and MC Slotervaart, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Nonclinical DMPK, West Chester, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek/The Netherlands Cancer Institute and MC Slotervaart, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Science, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Oncology Clinical Development, Frazer, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek/The Netherlands Cancer Institute and MC Slotervaart, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek/The Netherlands Cancer Institute and MC Slotervaart, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medical Oncology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Oncology Clinical Development, Frazer, PA, USA.', 'ImmunoGen, Inc, Waltham, MA, USA.', 'Teva Global Branded Products, 41 Moores Road, PO Box 4011, Frazer, PA, 19355, USA. laura.rabinovich@tevapharm.com.', 'Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Nonclinical DMPK, West Chester, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy & Pharmacology, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek/The Netherlands Cancer Institute and MC Slotervaart, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Teva Global Branded Products, Netanya, Israel.', 'Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Science, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medical Oncology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",20160525,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"[""0 (4'-desmethylhomoharringtonine)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Feces/chemistry', 'Female', 'Harringtonines/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics/urine', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/blood/*metabolism/urine']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Excretion', '*Mass balance', '*Metabolism', '*Omacetaxine mepesuccinate', '*Pharmacokinetics']",2016/05/26 06:00,2017/12/15 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10637-016-0360-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10637-016-0360-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2016 Oct;34(5):565-74. doi: 10.1007/s10637-016-0360-9.

However, flow cytometric testing for CD49d has not yet been widely adopted in the United States, in part due to the lack of establishment of its performance characteristics in the clinical setting, especially in comparison with the more common CLL/SLL prognostic markers CD38 and ZAP-70. METHODS: CD49d expression levels in 124 CLL/SLL cases were assessed among peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), and lymph node (LN) specimens and correlated with available CD38 and ZAP-70 expression and cytogenetic findings. For 10 PB/BM specimens, the stability of CD49d, CD38, and ZAP-70 expression was assessed at <24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 96 hours. RESULTS: 39% (28 of 71) PB, 56% (18 of 32) BM, and 71% (15 of 21) LN involved by CLL/SLL were CD49d+, using a >/=30% threshold. The mean for the CD49d+ cases was 2.8 standard deviations (SD) above the cutoff for positivity, compared with 1.7 SD for CD38 and 1.1 SD for ZAP-70. CD49d demonstrated the lowest mean SD (0.91) and coefficient of variation (CV) (8.0%) compared with CD38 (SD = 2.1, CV = 10.4%) and ZAP-70 (SD = 9.8, CV = 40.5%) in stability studies over a 96-hours time period. CD49d+ CLL/SLL correlated with trisomy 12 (P = 0.025) and lack of isolated deletion (13q) (P = 0.005). CD38+ CLL/SLL correlated with deletion (11q) (P = 0.025). ZAP-70 did not correlate with any underlying cytogenetic abnormality. CONCLUSIONS: CD49d is a robust adverse prognostic marker in CLL/SLL with superior performance characteristics.

Despite that hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment is associated with the formation of chemotherapeutic resistance, the exact role of an acidic microenvironment in the development of hypoxia-induced lung cancer multidrug resistance is still unknown. In the present study, we acidized the medium with 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES monohydrate) to mimic the acidic tumor microenvironment and observed the effects of acidification on lung cancer cell viability, the expression of ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) and myeloid cell leukemia1 (Mcl-1), and activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway. Thereafter, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the acidification-induced expression of ABCG2 and Mcl-1, and the potential therapeutic strategy to overcome acidification-associated multidrug resistance formation. We demonstrated that acidification obviously increased the expression of ABCG2 and Mcl-1 via PI3KAktmTOR-S6 pathway activation and contributed to multidrug resistance. Inhibition of PI3K-Akt activity efficiently abolished the effect of acidification on cell viability, indicating that the PI3K-Akt pathway may include potential therapeutic target molecules in acidized microenvironment-associated lung cancer chemotherapeutic resistance.","['Hu, Chun Fang', 'Huang, Yi Ying', 'Wang, Yong Jie', 'Gao, Feng Guang']","['Hu CF', 'Huang YY', 'Wang YJ', 'Gao FG']","['Department of Immunology, Basic Medicine Science, Medical College, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361102, P.R.

The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of routinely performing anaerobic blood cultures in pediatric oncology patients. METHODS: Prospective study was conducted on pediatric (<18 years) patients affected with febrile syndrome after receiving chemotherapy for hematological or solid malignancies. Samples were inoculated into pediatric aerobic and standard anaerobic bottles (BacT/Alert automatic system). Strains were considered clinically significant, or deemed as contaminants, depending on isolation circumstances and clinical criteria. RESULTS: A total of 876 blood cultures from 228 patients were processed during the 21-month study period (January 2014 to September 2015). Baseline diagnosis included 143 solid tumors and 67/18 cases of leukemia/lymphoma. Bacterial growth was detected in 90 (10.2%) blood cultures for 95 different isolates, of which 62 (7.1%)/63 isolates were considered clinically significant. Among the latter, 38 (60.3%) microorganisms grew in both aerobic and anaerobic bottles, 18 (28.6%) only in aerobic bottles, and 7 (11.1%) only in anaerobic bottles. Gram-negative bacilli (33; 52.4%), mainly from the Enterobacteriaceae family, were the most frequently isolated microorganisms. Overall, only 3 out of 90 isolates (3.3%) were strict anaerobes (Propionibacterium acnes), and all of them were deemed contaminants. CONCLUSION: Strict anaerobes did not cause significant infections in febrile pediatric oncology patients, and anaerobic blood culture bottles offered no additional advantages over aerobic media. Our results suggest that routine blood cultures should be solely processed in aerobic media in this group of patients.","['Monsonis Cabedo, Manuel', 'Rives Sola, Susana', 'Noguera-Julian, Antoni', 'Urrea Ayala, Mireia', 'Cruz Martinez, Ofelia', 'Gene Giralt, Amadeu']","['Monsonis Cabedo M', 'Rives Sola S', 'Noguera-Julian A', 'Urrea Ayala M', 'Cruz Martinez O', 'Gene Giralt A']","['Department of Microbiology, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Esplugues de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Esplugues de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Infectious Diseases Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Esplugues de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Infections Control Unit, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Esplugues de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Esplugues de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Microbiology, Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Esplugues de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.

There has been a growing international interest in patient and public involvement in setting research priorities to reduce the risk of discrepancy between what patients with cancer and their relatives experience as important unanswered questions and those which are actually researched. This study aims to challenge the conventional research process by inviting patients with life-threatening cancer (primary malignant brain tumours or acute leukaemia), relatives and patient organisations to join forces with clinical specialists and researchers to identify, discuss and prioritise supportive care and rehabilitation issues in future research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an exploratory qualitative study comprising two sets of three focus group interviews (FGIs): one set for primary malignant brain tumours and the other for acute leukaemia. Separate FGIs will be carried out with patients and relatives including representation from patient organisations and clinical specialists to identify important unanswered questions and research topics within each group. The FGIs will be video/audio recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. This study will contribute to a patient-centred research agenda that captures issues that patients, their relatives, clinical specialists and researchers consider important.

However, cumulative experience now includes at least 5 examples of interventions with post-relapse objective response rates greater than 50% that failed to improve outcomes when applied prior to relapse. Emerging insights into oligoclonality provide some explanation. In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the predominant clones at relapse differ from the predominant clones at presentation. Arguably, the more highly proliferative clones that predominate at relapse differ in drug sensitivity from the less proliferative clones that escape primary therapy. Interventions effective against the predominant clones at relapse may have no effect on the antecedent escapee clones. Response is not sufficient in new agent development. Duration of response has attracted less attention because of variability in post-remission therapy but some patient subsets have such a uniformly dismal outcome that details of post-remission therapy may be irrelevant. Benchmarks are needed. Are recovering blasts members of the same clone or do they represent a new clone? When you eradicate the predominant clones you get a response. When you eradicate all clones, you get a cure.","['Gaynon, Paul S', 'Sun, Weili']","['Gaynon PS', 'Sun W']","[""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, University of Southern California."", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, University of Southern California.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160525,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Secondary Prevention']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*new drug development', '*oligoclonality']",2016/05/26 06:00,2017/04/30 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.14143 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Jun;173(6):950-7. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14143.

The mechanisms responsible for CML-SC survival need to be understood for designing therapies. Several previous studies suggest that TKIs could modulate CML-SC quiescence. Unfortunately, CML-SCs are insufficiently available. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a promising alternative. In this work, we used iPSCs derived from CML patients (Ph+). Ph+ iPSC clones expressed lower levels of stemness markers than normal iPSCs. BCR-ABL1 was found to be involved in stemness regulation and ERK1/2 to have a key role in the signaling pathway. TKIs unexpectedly promoted stemness marker expression in Ph+ iPSC clones. Imatinib also retained quiescence and induced stemness gene expression in CML-SCs. Our results suggest that TKIs might have a role in residual disease and confirm the need for a targeted therapy different from TKIs that could overcome the stemness-promoting effect caused by TKIs. Interestingly, a similar pro-stemness effect was observed in normal iPSCs and hematopoietic SCs. These findings could help to explain CML resistance mechanisms and the teratogenic side-effects of TKIs in embryonic cells.","['Charaf, L', 'Mahon, F-X', 'Lamrissi-Garcia, I', 'Moranvillier, I', 'Beliveau, F', 'Cardinaud, B', 'Dabernat, S', 'de Verneuil, H', 'Moreau-Gaudry, F', 'Bedel, A']","['Charaf L', 'Mahon FX', 'Lamrissi-Garcia I', 'Moranvillier I', 'Beliveau F', 'Cardinaud B', 'Dabernat S', 'de Verneuil H', 'Moreau-Gaudry F', 'Bedel A']","['Inserm U1035, Biotherapies des Maladies Genetiques et Cancers, Bordeaux, France.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, FR TransBiomed, Bordeaux, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence GR-Ex, Bordeaux, France."", 'Inserm U1035, Biotherapies des Maladies Genetiques et Cancers, Bordeaux, France.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, FR TransBiomed, Bordeaux, France.', 'Pole de Biologie et Pathologie CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Institut Bergonie, SIRIC BRIO, Bordeaux, France.', 'Inserm U1035, Biotherapies des Maladies Genetiques et Cancers, Bordeaux, France.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, FR TransBiomed, Bordeaux, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence GR-Ex, Bordeaux, France."", 'Inserm U1035, Biotherapies des Maladies Genetiques et Cancers, Bordeaux, France.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, FR TransBiomed, Bordeaux, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence GR-Ex, Bordeaux, France."", 'Inserm U1035, Biotherapies des Maladies Genetiques et Cancers, Bordeaux, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence GR-Ex, Bordeaux, France."", 'Inserm U1035, Biotherapies des Maladies Genetiques et Cancers, Bordeaux, France.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, FR TransBiomed, Bordeaux, France.', 'Institut Polytechnique de Bordeaux, Talence, France.', 'Inserm U1035, Biotherapies des Maladies Genetiques et Cancers, Bordeaux, France.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, FR TransBiomed, Bordeaux, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence GR-Ex, Bordeaux, France."", 'Pole de Biologie et Pathologie CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Inserm U1035, Biotherapies des Maladies Genetiques et Cancers, Bordeaux, France.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, FR TransBiomed, Bordeaux, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence GR-Ex, Bordeaux, France."", 'Pole de Biologie et Pathologie CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Inserm U1035, Biotherapies des Maladies Genetiques et Cancers, Bordeaux, France.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, FR TransBiomed, Bordeaux, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence GR-Ex, Bordeaux, France."", 'Pole de Biologie et Pathologie CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Inserm U1035, Biotherapies des Maladies Genetiques et Cancers, Bordeaux, France.', 'Universite de Bordeaux, FR TransBiomed, Bordeaux, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Excellence GR-Ex, Bordeaux, France."", 'Pole de Biologie et Pathologie CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160525,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/physiology', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2016/05/26 06:00,2017/08/31 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016154 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.154 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Jan;31(1):65-74. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.154.

CML was the first malignancy in which a unique chromosomal abnormality was identified and a pathophysiologic association was suggested. The hallmark of CML is a reciprocal chromosomal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9; 22)(q34; q11), creating a derivative 9q+ and a shortened 22q-. The latter, known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, harbors the breakpoint cluster region-abelson (BCR-ABL) fusion gene, encoding the constitutively active BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase that is necessary and sufficient for initiating CML. The successful implementation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the treatment of CML remains a flagship for molecularly targeted therapy in cancer. TKIs have changed the clinical course of CML; however, some patients nonetheless demonstrate primary or secondary resistance to such therapy and require an alternative therapeutic strategy. Therefore, the assessment of early response to treatment with TKIs has become an important tool in the clinical monitoring of CML patients. Although mutations in the BCR-ABL have proven to be the most prominent mechanism of resistance to TKIs, other mechanisms-either rendering the leukemic cells still dependent on BCR-ABL activity or supporting oncogenic properties of the leukemic cells independent of BCR-ABL signaling-have been identified. This article provides an overview of the current understanding of CML pathogenesis; recommendations for diagnostic tools, treatment strategies, and management guidelines; and highlights the BCR-ABL-dependent and -independent mechanisms that contribute to the development of resistance to TKIs.","['Ali, Mohamed A M']",['Ali MA'],"['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University, Abbassia, 11566, Cairo, Egypt. mohd_ali2@sci.asu.edu.eg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Mol Diagn Ther,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Retreatment', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/05/26 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2016/05/26 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s40291-016-0208-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s40291-016-0208-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn Ther. 2016 Aug;20(4):315-33. doi: 10.1007/s40291-016-0208-1.,10.1007/s40291-016-0208-1 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients were included and monitored in an adherence program (SAWA program). The male/female ratio was 3:1. The median age was 50 years, and the mean age was 50 years. As frontline treatment, 29 patients started imatinib and 5 patients received second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We defined compliance to the monitoring tests as regulary realizing the qPCR at 3, 6, and 12 months. Of the 36 patients, 15 underwent the recommended tests at 3, 6, and 12 months, representing a compliance rate of 41.6%; 28 of the 34 patients underwent the recommended tests only twice in the first follow-up year. Only 14 patients underwent qPCR at 3 months. We believe that despite the inclusion of our patients in an adherence program, the compliance rate is still low. We also believe that greater effort is required to improve the adherence to regular follow-up examinations.","['Massoud, Marcel', 'Nasr, Fadi', 'Sakr, Riwa', 'Hawi, Jenny', 'Kerbage, Fouad', 'Chahine, Georges']","['Massoud M', 'Nasr F', 'Sakr R', 'Hawi J', 'Kerbage F', 'Chahine G']","['Faculty of Medicine, Holy Spirit University of Kaslik Medical School, Kaslik, Lebanon, and University Hospital Center Notre Dame de Secours, Byblos, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Saint Joseph University Medical School, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Holy Spirit University of Kaslik Medical School, Kaslik, Lebanon, and University Hospital Center Notre Dame de Secours, Byblos, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Holy Spirit University of Kaslik Medical School, Kaslik, Lebanon, and University Hospital Center Notre Dame de Secours, Byblos, Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Holy Spirit University of Kaslik Medical School, Kaslik, Lebanon, and University Hospital Center Notre Dame de Secours, Byblos, Lebanon.

Oxidative stressinduced apoptosis is the predominant factor accounting for cardiac ischemiareperfusion injury. miR153 has been previously shown to have an antitumor effect in cancer. However, whether miR153 is involved in oxidative stressinduced apoptosis in the heart remains to be elucidated. To this end, the present study used reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect miR-153 levels upon oxidative stress, and evaluated apoptosis, autophagy and expression of critical genes by western blotting. A luciferase assay was also used to confirm the potential target gene. In the present study, it was found that the expression of miR153 was significantly increased upon H2O2 stimulation, and the inhibition of endogenous miR153 decreased apoptosis. To further identify the mechanism underlying the proapoptotic effect of miR153, the present study analyzed the 3'untranslated region of myeloid cell leukemia1 (Mcl1), and found that Mcl1 was potentially targeted by miR153. The forced expression of miR153 inhibited the expression of Mcl1 and luciferase activity, which was reversed by its antisense inhibitor. Furthermore, it was shown that the inhibition of miR153 induced autophagy during oxidative stress, and that its effects of autophagy induction and apoptosis inhibition were efficiently abrogated by Mcl1 small interfering RNA. In conclusion, the results of the present study elucidated a novel mechanism by which miR153 regulates the survival of cardimyocytes during oxidative stress through the modulation of apoptosis and autophagy. These effects may be mediated directly by targeting Mcl1. These finding revealed the potential clinical value of miR153 in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.","['Zou, Yuhai', 'Liu, Wenting', 'Zhang, Jinxia', 'Xiang, Dingcheng']","['Zou Y', 'Liu W', 'Zhang J', 'Xiang D']","['Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, P.R.

Because CCR4 is expressed on normal regulatory T cells as well as on ATLL cells, MOG may accelerate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) by eradicating regulatory T cells in patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). However, there is limited information about its safety and efficacy in patients treated with MOG before allo-HSCT. In the present study, 25 patients with ATLL were treated with MOG before allo-HSCT, after which 18 patients (72%) achieved remission. The overall survival and progression-free survival at 1 year post-transplantation were 20.2% (95% CI, 6.0% to 40.3%) and 15.0% (95% CI, 4.3% to 32.0%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD was 64.0% (95% CI, 40.7% to 80.1%) for grade II-IV and 34.7% (95% CI, 15.8% to 54.4%) for grade III-IV. The cumulative incidence of transplantation-related mortality (TRM) was 49.0% (95% CI, 27.0% to 67.8%). Six of 7 patients with acute GVHD grade III-IV died from GVHD, which was the leading cause of death. In particular, a shorter interval from the last administration of MOG to allo-HSCT was associated with more severe GVHD. MOG use before allo-HSCT may decrease the ATLL burden; however, it is associated with an increase in TRM due to severe GVHD. Because MOG is a potent anti-ATLL agent, new treatment protocols should be developed to integrate MOG at suitable doses and timing of administration to minimize unwanted GVHD development.","['Sugio, Takeshi', 'Kato, Koji', 'Aoki, Takatoshi', 'Ohta, Takanori', 'Saito, Noriyuki', 'Yoshida, Shuro', 'Kawano, Ichiro', 'Henzan, Hideho', 'Kadowaki, Masanori', 'Takase, Ken', 'Muta, Tsuyoshi', 'Miyawaki, Kohta', 'Yamauchi, Takuji', 'Shima, Takahiro', 'Takashima, Shuichiro', 'Mori, Yasuo', 'Yoshimoto, Goichi', 'Kamezaki, Kenjiro', 'Takenaka, Katsuto', 'Iwasaki, Hiromi', 'Ogawa, Ryosuke', 'Ohno, Yuju', 'Eto, Tetsuya', 'Kamimura, Tomohiko', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Akashi, Koichi']","['Sugio T', 'Kato K', 'Aoki T', 'Ohta T', 'Saito N', 'Yoshida S', 'Kawano I', 'Henzan H', 'Kadowaki M', 'Takase K', 'Muta T', 'Miyawaki K', 'Yamauchi T', 'Shima T', 'Takashima S', 'Mori Y', 'Yoshimoto G', 'Kamezaki K', 'Takenaka K', 'Iwasaki H', 'Ogawa R', 'Ohno Y', 'Eto T', 'Kamimura T', 'Miyamoto T', 'Akashi K']","['Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine and Biosystemic Science, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, Japan.

We examined the possibility of a similar effect in a cohort of 614 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients receiving unrelated donor (URD) T cell-replete marrow or peripheral blood grafts. Sixty-four percent (n = 396) of donor-recipient pairs were 10/10 allele HLA matched and 26% were 9/10 allele matched. Seventy percent of donors had KIR B/x genotype; the others had KIR A/A genotype. NHL patients receiving 10/10 HLA-matched URD grafts with KIR B/x donors experienced significantly lower relapse at 5 years (26%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 21% to 32% versus 37%; 95% CI, 27% to 46%; P = .05) compared with KIR A/A donors, resulting in improved 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) (35%; 95% CI, 26% to 44% versus 22%; 95% CI, 11% to 35%; P = .007). In multivariate analysis, use of KIR B/x donors was associated with significantly reduced relapse risk (relative risk [RR], .63, P = .02) and improved PFS (RR, .71, P = .008). The relapse protection afforded by KIR B/x donors was not observed in HLA-mismatched transplantations and was not specific to any particular KIR-B gene. Selecting 10/10 HLA-matched and KIR B/x donors should benefit patients with NHL receiving URD allogeneic transplantation.","['Bachanova, Veronika', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Wang, Tao', 'Marsh, Steven G E', 'Trachtenberg, Elizabeth', 'Haagenson, Michael D', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Ladner, Martha', 'Guethlein, Lisbeth A', 'Parham, Peter', 'Miller, Jeffrey S', 'Cooley, Sarah A']","['Bachanova V', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Wang T', 'Marsh SGE', 'Trachtenberg E', 'Haagenson MD', 'Spellman SR', 'Ladner M', 'Guethlein LA', 'Parham P', 'Miller JS', 'Cooley SA']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential synergistic carcinogenic effects of concurrent exposure to ELFMF and formaldehyde in four groups of male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. METHODS: One group was exposed from prenatal life until natural death to S-50 Hz MF and to formaldehyde in drinking water from 6 weeks of age for 104 weeks, two groups were treated only with formaldehyde or only with MF and one group served as untreated control. RESULTS: Compared to untreated controls, exposure to MF and formaldehyde causes in males a statistically significant increased incidence of malignant tumors (P </= 0.01), thyroid C-cell carcinomas (P </= 0.01), and hemolymphoreticular neoplasias (P </= 0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed among female groups. CONCLUSIONS: Life-span exposure to MF and formaldehyde induces statistically significant carcinogenic effects in male rats.

In the developing prostate, even brief exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can increase risk for developing cancer in adulthood, with disruption of the epigenome thought to play a key role in this developmental reprogramming. We find that EDC-induced nongenomic phosphoinositide 3-kinase; (PI3K) signaling engages the histone methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1), responsible for the histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) active epigenetic mark, to increase cleavage and formation of active MLL1 dimers. In the developing prostate, EDC-induced MLL1 activation increased H3K4me3 at genes associated with prostate cancer, with increased H3K4me3 and elevated basal and hormone-induced expression of reprogrammed genes persisting into adulthood. These data identify a mechanism for MLL1 activation that is vulnerable to disruption by environmental exposures, and link MLL1 activation by EDCs to developmental reprogramming of genes involved in prostate cancer.","['Wang, Quan', 'Trevino, Lindsey S', 'Wong, Rebecca Lee Yean', 'Medvedovic, Mario', 'Chen, Jing', 'Ho, Shuk-Mei', 'Shen, Jianjun', 'Foulds, Charles E', 'Coarfa, Cristian', ""O'Malley, Bert W"", 'Shilatifard, Ali', 'Walker, Cheryl L']","['Wang Q', 'Trevino LS', 'Wong RL', 'Medvedovic M', 'Chen J', 'Ho SM', 'Shen J', 'Foulds CE', 'Coarfa C', ""O'Malley BW"", 'Shilatifard A', 'Walker CL']","['Center for Translational Cancer Research (Q.W., L.S.T., R.L.Y.W., C.L.W.), Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University System Health Science Center, and Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology (C.E.F., C.C., B.W.O.), Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030;

Because much more can be gained through such studies, we add information on another 22 ESS examined by karyotyping, PCR analysis, expression array analysis, and transcriptome sequencing. In spite of the known preference for certain pathogenetic pathways, we found considerable genetic heterogeneity in high-grade (HG) as well as in low-grade (LG) ESS. Not all HG tumors showed a YWHAE-NUTM chimeric transcript and as many as six LGESS showed no hitherto known ESS-related fusions. Among the transcripts identified by transcriptome sequencing and verified by Sanger sequencing, new variants of ZC3H7-BCOR and its reciprocal BCOR-ZC3H7 were identified as was involvement of the CREBBP and MLLT4 genes (both well known leukemia-related genes) in two new fusions. FISH analysis identified a known EPC1-PHF1 fusion which led to the identification of a new variant at the molecular level. The fact that around 70 genes were found differentially expressed, by microarray analysis, when comparing LGESS showing ESS-related fusions with LGESS without such transcripts, underscores the biochemical importance of the observed genetic heterogeneity and hints that new subgroups/entities in LGESS still remain undiscovered.

We conducted a large records-based case-control study of childhood leukaemia risk in the population living near power lines in California. METHODS: The study included 5788 childhood leukaemia and 3308 central nervous system (CNS) cancer cases (for comparison) born in and diagnosed in California (1986-2008), and matched to population-based controls by age and sex. We geocoded birth address and estimated the distance from residence to transmission lines using geographic information systems, aerial imagery, and, for some residences, site visits. RESULTS: For leukaemia, there was a slight excess of cases within 50 m of a transmission line over 200 kV (odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 0.7-2.7). There was no evidence of increased risk for distances beyond 50 m, for lower-voltage lines, or for CNS cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings did not clearly support an increased childhood leukaemia risk associated with close proximity (<50 m) to higher voltage lines, but could be consistent with a small increased risk. Reports of increased risk for distances beyond 50 m were not replicated.","['Crespi, Catherine M', 'Vergara, Ximena P', 'Hooper, Chris', 'Oksuzyan, Sona', 'Wu, Sheng', 'Cockburn, Myles', 'Kheifets, Leeka']","['Crespi CM', 'Vergara XP', 'Hooper C', 'Oksuzyan S', 'Wu S', 'Cockburn M', 'Kheifets L']","['Department of Biostatistics, University of California Los Angeles Fielding School of Public Health, 650 Charles E.

During this process, ameloblasts directionally secrete enamel matrix proteins and morphologically change from low columnar cells to polarized tall columnar cells, both of which are essential for the proper formation of enamel. In this study, we elucidated the molecular mechanism that integrates ameloblast function and morphology. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the restricted expression of semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) and RhoA activation status are closely associated with ameloblast differentiation in mouse incisors. In addition, in vitro gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that Sema4D acts upstream of RhoA to regulate cell polarity and amelogenin expression via the Plexin B1/Leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) complex during ameloblast differentiation. Experiments in transgenic mice demonstrated that expression of a dominant-negative form of RhoA in dental epithelium hindered ameloblast differentiation and subsequent enamel formation, as well as perturbing the establishment of polarized cell morphology and vectorial amelogenin expression. Finally, we showed that spatially restricted Akt mediates between Sema4D-RhoA signaling and these downstream cellular events. Collectively, our results reveal a novel signaling network, the Sema4D-RhoA-Akt signal cascade, that coordinates cellular function and morphology and highlights the importance of specific spatiotemporally restricted components of a signaling pathway in the regulation of ameloblast differentiation.

METHODS: We reviewed recent publications on Pub med and abstracts from mayor congresses relevant to the disease. RESULTS: CML is a hematological neoplasm observed more frequently in adults, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Until recently, available treatments improved patients' quality of life but did not modify survival. It was not until interferon appeared that patients received a drug that reduced and even eliminated Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) cells. DISCUSSION: With the start of the new millennium, the International Randomized Study of Interferon-alpha plus cytarabine versus STI571 (IRIS) trial demonstrated a dramatic improvement in survival by comparing imatinib versus interferon alpha plus cytarabine. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved imatinib as first-line treatment for newly diagnosed CML in 2001 due to its outstanding effectiveness. Years later, three second-generation (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) and one third-generation (ponatinib) tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were developed and approved. These highly effective treatment options, however, are not affordable for many low-income patients. Additionally, the use of drugs that effectively treat but do not cure the disease has resulted in an important economic impact for patients and health care systems worldwide, especially those in developing countries. Imatinib is the least expensive and a very effective TKI in many low-income countries. Early allogeneic stem cell transplantation must be considered in the management of selected patients before CML transformation.","['Gomez-Almaguer, David', 'Cantu-Rodriguez, Olga G', 'Gutierrez-Aguirre, Cesar H', 'Ruiz-Arguelles, Guillermo J']","['Gomez-Almaguer D', 'Cantu-Rodriguez OG', 'Gutierrez-Aguirre CH', 'Ruiz-Arguelles GJ']","['a Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez"" , Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon , Monterrey , NL , Mexico.', 'a Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez"" , Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon , Monterrey , NL , Mexico.', 'a Hematology Service, Hospital Universitario ""Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez"" , Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon , Monterrey , NL , Mexico.', 'b Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla, Clinica Ruiz , Puebla , Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160524,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Health Resources/economics/*standards', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/economics/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Complete cytogenetic remission', '*FISH', '*Generic', '*Imatinib', '*Low-income', '*Nilotinib']",2016/05/25 06:00,2017/04/07 06:00,['2016/05/25 06:00'],"['2016/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2016.1182695 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2016 Dec;21(10):576-582. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2016.1182695.

We analyzed del(5q) and accompanying molecular mutations in MDS, MPN and MDS/MPN cases. A high del(5q) frequency was revealed in MDS (1869/11398 cases; 16%), followed by MDS/MPN (37/1107; 3%) and MPN (97/6373; 2%). To investigate potential associations of the del(5q) size with the respective phenotypes, we applied array CGH analyses in selected cohorts of 61 MDS, 22 MDS/MPN and 23 MPN cases. The size varied between 16 and 119 Mb with no differences between the entities. However, MPN and MDS/MPN cases with del(5q) sole showed a significantly smaller del(5q) than cases with additional aberrations. Sequence analysis of 27 genes revealed >/=1 mutation in 91% of patients. The highest mutation frequencies in the total cohort were observed for TP53 (31%), JAK2 (23%) and DNMT3A (18%). The molecular mutation patterns in the del(5q) cohorts were different between the entities but resembled known patterns of cohorts not selected for del(5q). Further, TP53 mutations were significantly more frequent in cases with a larger deletion size (P = 0.003). The results suggest a correlation of large del(5q) with TP53 mutations and with additional chromosomal aberrations possibly contributing to more severe courses of these cases.

The dog had previously been diagnosed with chronic lymphoid leukemia and suspected immune-mediated destruction of his bone marrow precursor cells, possibly due to therapy with immunosuppressive dosages of prednisone and azathioprine. During the physical examination, abnormal findings included an increased body temperature and horizontal nystagmus. Diagnostic investigations included a computed tomography (CT) scan, which confirmed bilateral otitis media, and a blood culture, which was positive for Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b (epidemic clone 1). Upon treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam, enrofloxacin, and minocycline, the dog became normothermic and the neurologic signs improved. L monocytogenes serotype 4b (epidemic clone 1) has been associated with outbreaks of human listeriosis originating from food contamination. Although rare case reports of Listeria spp. infection in dogs exist, an actual infection with the epidemic clone 1 strain has never before been reported in a dog. It should be included in the differential diagnoses in immunocompromised dogs with clinical signs of septicemia.","['Pritchard, Jessica C', 'Jacob, Megan E', 'Ward, Todd J', 'Parsons, Cameron T', 'Kathariou, Sophia', 'Wood, Michael W']","['Pritchard JC', 'Jacob ME', 'Ward TJ', 'Parsons CT', 'Kathariou S', 'Wood MW']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Department of Population Health and Pathobiology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Microbial Genomics and Bioprocessing Research Unit, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Peoria, IL, USA.', 'Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine, Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20160524,United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Blood culture', 'canine', 'food contamination', 'infection', 'sepsis']",2016/05/25 06:00,2016/05/25 06:00,['2016/05/25 06:00'],"['2016/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/vcp.12363 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2016 Jun;45(2):254-259. doi: 10.1111/vcp.12363.

Recent research indicates that the SETD2 gene is associated with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This study aims to identify potential lead compounds from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) using virtual screening for SET domain containing 2 (SETD2) protein against acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Docking simulation was performed to determine potential candidates which obtain suitable docking poses in the binding domain of the SETD2 protein. We also performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to investigate the stability of docking poses of SETD2 protein complexes with the top three TCM candidates and a control. According to the results of docking and MD simulation, coniselin and coniferyl ferulate have high binding affinity and stable interactions with the SETD2 protein. Coniselin is isolated from the alcoholic extract of Comiselinum vaginatum Thell. Coniferyl ferulate can be isolated from Angelica sinensis, Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf, and Notopterygium forbesii. Although S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine has more stable interactions with key residues in the binding domain than coniselin and coniferyl ferulate during MD simulation, the TCM compounds coniselin and coniferyl ferulate are still potential candidates as lead compounds for further study in the drug development process with the SETD2 protein against acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Chang, Y-L', 'Chen, H-Y', 'Chen, K-B', 'Chen, K-C', 'Chang, K-L', 'Chang, P-C', 'Chang, T-T', 'Chen, Y-C']","['Chang YL', 'Chen HY', 'Chen KB', 'Chen KC', 'Chang KL', 'Chang PC', 'Chang TT', 'Chen YC']","['a Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering , Asia University , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'a Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering , Asia University , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'a Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering , Asia University , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'b School of Medicine , College of Medicine, China Medical University , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'c Department of Anesthesiology , China Medical University Hospital , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'd School of Pharmacy , China Medical University , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'a Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering , Asia University , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'e Department of Pharmacy , China Medical University Hospital, China Medical University , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'a Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering , Asia University , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'f School of Post-Baccalaureate Chinese Medicine , College of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'g Department of Chinese Pediatrics , China Medical University Hospital , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'a Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering , Asia University , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'h Research Center for Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture , China Medical University , Taichung , Taiwan.', 'i Department of Medical Research , China Medical University Hospital , Taichung , Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160524,England,SAR QSAR Environ Res,SAR and QSAR in environmental research,9440156,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzodioxoles)', '0 (Coumaric Acids)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (coniselin)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*chemistry', 'Benzodioxoles/chemistry', 'Binding Sites', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coumaric Acids/chemistry', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*chemistry', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship']",['NOTNLM'],"['Leukaemia', 'histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SET domain containing 2 (SETD2)', 'molecular dynamics (MD)', 'traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)', 'virtual screening']",2016/05/25 06:00,2017/03/23 06:00,['2016/05/25 06:00'],"['2016/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/1062936X.2016.1186112 [doi]'],ppublish,SAR QSAR Environ Res. 2016 Jul;27(7):589-608. doi: 10.1080/1062936X.2016.1186112.

This study aimed to assess the effect of aloe vera solution on stomatitis and its pain intensity in patients undergoing chemotherapeutic procedures. METHODS: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 64 patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia undergoing chemotherapy were randomly divided into a control and an intervention group. The intervention group patients were asked to wash their mouths with 5 ml of aloe vera solution for two minutes three times a day for 14 days. The control group patients, however, used only the ordinary mouthwashes recommended in hematologic centers. The patients' mouths were examined by two assistants on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14. The intensity of stomatitis was recorded according to WHO stomatitis intensity checklists and pain was evaluated using Visual Analog Scale. The data were analyzed by SPSS statistical software, version 18. RESULTS: The results showed that aloe vera solution mouthwash significantly reduced the intensity of stomatitis and its pain in the intervention group compared to the control group. On the first day, no significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the mean intensity of stomatitis (P=0.178) and pain (P=0.154). However, a significant difference was observed between the two groups in this regard on other days (days 3-14: P=0.001 for stomatitis intensity, P=0.001 for pain). CONCLUSIONS: Aloe vera solution can improve the patients' nutritional status, reduce stomatitis and its pain intensity, and increase the patients' satisfaction.

Dicer is one of the main regulators of miRNA biogenesis, and deregulation of its expression has been indicated as a possible cause of miRNA alterations observed in various cancers. Our aim was to analyze the expression of the Dicer protein and its relationship with ALL and CLL. This cross-sectional study was performed from 2010 to 2012 in Shahid Faghihi Hospital, Shiraz, Iran. In this study, 30 patients with CLL, 21 patients with ALL, 10 child healthy donors, and 19 adult healthy donors were recruited. The patients' samples were checked via flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunocytochemistry. The controls' samples were also examined in the hematology ward. Total RNA was extracted from the bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of the patients and controls. Then, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to estimate the level of Dicer miRNA. The outcomes of the expression analysis of Dicer revealed statistically significant differences between the ALL patients/child healthy controls (mean+/-SD, 0.19+/-0.28 vs. 0.73+/-0.12; P<0.001) and the CLL patients/adult healthy controls (mean+/-SD, 0.24+/-0.25 vs. 0.41+/-0.28; P=0.033). This is the first piece of evidence showing that the expression of the Dicer gene greatly decreased in the patients with ALL in comparison to the child controls. The expression of the Dicer gene was also downregulated in the patients with CLL compared to the adult controls. Given the above findings, the expression of Dicer may play an important role in the progression and prognosis of these diseases.","['Farzaneh, Mohamad Reza', 'Shahryari, Jahanbanoo', 'Safaei, Akbar', 'Valibeigi, Behnaz', 'Davani, Shahrbanou Karimi', 'Tabibi, Narjes']","['Farzaneh MR', 'Shahryari J', 'Safaei A', 'Valibeigi B', 'Davani SK', 'Tabibi N']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, School of Sciences, University of Sistan and Baluchistan, Zahedan, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Med Sci,Iranian journal of medical sciences,8104374,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DICER1 protein', 'Gene expression', 'Leukemia']",2016/05/25 06:00,2016/05/25 06:01,['2016/05/25 06:00'],"['2016/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/25 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Med Sci. 2016 May;41(3):223-9.,,,PMC4876301,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We analyzed a data set from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development that was created by linking birth certificates, death certificates, and hospital discharge abstracts up to age 1 year. Subjects were 5 144 849 infants born in California hospitals at >/=35 weeks' gestation from 1998 to 2007. We used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes to identify phototherapy at <15 days and discharge diagnoses of cancer at 61 to 365 days. We adjusted for potential confounding variables by using traditional and propensity-adjusted logistic regression models. RESULTS: Cancer was diagnosed in 58/178 017 infants with diagnosis codes for phototherapy and 1042/4 966 832 infants without such codes (32.6/100 000 vs 21.0/100 000; relative risk 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.0, P = .002). In propensity-adjusted analyses, associations were seen between phototherapy and overall cancer (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9), myeloid leukemia (aOR 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.0), and kidney cancer (aOR 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-5.1). The marginal propensity-adjusted absolute risk increase for cancer after phototherapy in the total population was 9.4/100 000 (number needed to harm of 10 638). Because of the higher baseline risk of cancer in infants with Down syndrome, the number needed to harm was 1285. CONCLUSIONS: Phototherapy may slightly increase the risk of cancer in infancy, although the absolute risk increase is small. This risk should be considered when making phototherapy treatment decisions, especially for infants with bilirubin levels below current treatment guidelines.","['Wickremasinghe, Andrea C', 'Kuzniewicz, Michael W', 'Grimes, Barbara A', 'McCulloch, Charles E', 'Newman, Thomas B']","['Wickremasinghe AC', 'Kuzniewicz MW', 'Grimes BA', 'McCulloch CE', 'Newman TB']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Santa Clara, California; Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, and andrea.wickremasinghe@kp.org.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, California; and Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California.', 'Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, and.', 'Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, and.', 'Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, and Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, California; and Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,['RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)'],IM,"['Bilirubin/blood', 'Birth Certificates', 'California/epidemiology', 'Death Certificates', 'Female', 'Hospital Records', 'Humans', 'Hyperbilirubinemia, Neonatal/*therapy', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Phototherapy/*adverse effects', 'Propensity Score']",,,2016/05/25 06:00,2017/06/16 06:00,['2016/05/25 06:00'],"['2016/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2015-1353 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2015-1353 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2016 Jun;137(6). pii: peds.2015-1353. doi: 10.1542/peds.2015-1353.,10.1542/peds.2015-1353 [doi] e20151353 [pii],['UL1 TR000004/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Copyright (c) 2016 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.'],"['Pediatrics. 2016 Jun;137(6):.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 499 621 children born at >/=35 weeks' gestation from 1995 to 2011 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals, who survived to hospital discharge and were followed >/=60 days. We obtained data on home and inpatient phototherapy, covariates, and cancer incidence from electronic records. We used propensity-adjusted Cox and Poisson models to control for confounding and unequal follow-up times. RESULTS: There were 60 children with a diagnosis of cancer among 39 403 exposed to phototherapy (25 per 100 000 person-years), compared with 651 of 460 218 unexposed children (18 per 100 000 person-years; incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.4; P = .01). Phototherapy was associated with increased rates of any leukemia (IRR 2.1; P = .0007), nonlymphocytic leukemia (IRR 4.0; P = .0004), and liver cancer (IRR 5.2; P = .04). With adjustment for a propensity score that incorporated bilirubin levels, chromosomal disorders, congenital anomalies, and other covariates, associations were no longer statistically significant: Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 1.0 (0.7-1.6) for any cancer, 1.6 (0.8-3.5) for any leukemia, 1.9 (0.6-6.9) for nonlymphocytic leukemia, and 1.4 (0.2-12) for liver cancer. Upper limits of 95% confidence intervals for adjusted 10-year excess risk were generally <0.1% but reached 4.4% for children with Down syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Although phototherapy use was associated with increased cancer rates (particularly nonlymphocytic leukemia), control for confounding variables eliminated or attenuated the associations. Nonetheless, the possibility of even partial causality suggests that avoiding unnecessary phototherapy may be prudent.","['Newman, Thomas B', 'Wickremasinghe, Andrea C', 'Walsh, Eileen M', 'Grimes, Barbara A', 'McCulloch, Charles E', 'Kuzniewicz, Michael W']","['Newman TB', 'Wickremasinghe AC', 'Walsh EM', 'Grimes BA', 'McCulloch CE', 'Kuzniewicz MW']","['Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, California; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California; and newman@epi.ucsf.edu.', 'Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and Department of Pediatrics, Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara, Santa Clara, California.', 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California; and.', 'Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and.', 'Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and.', 'Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, California; Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, California; and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,['RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)'],IM,"['Bilirubin/blood', 'California/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hyperbilirubinemia, Neonatal/*therapy', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Phototherapy/*adverse effects', 'Propensity Score', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2016/05/25 06:00,2017/06/16 06:00,['2016/05/25 06:00'],"['2016/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['peds.2015-1354 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2015-1354 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2016 Jun;137(6). pii: peds.2015-1354. doi: 10.1542/peds.2015-1354.,10.1542/peds.2015-1354 [doi] e20151354 [pii],['R01 HS020618/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States'],,,,,['Copyright (c) 2016 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.'],"['Pediatrics. 2016 Jun;137(6):.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP were randomly assigned to receive dasatinib 100 mg once daily (n = 259) or imatinib 400 mg once daily (n = 260). RESULTS: At the time of study closure, 61% and 63% of dasatinib- and imatinib-treated patients remained on initial therapy, respectively. Cumulative rates of major molecular response and molecular responses with a 4.0- or 4.5-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcripts from baseline by 5 years remained statistically significantly higher for dasatinib compared with imatinib. Rates for progression-free and overall survival at 5 years remained high and similar across treatment arms. In patients who achieved BCR-ABL1 </= 10% at 3 months (dasatinib, 84%; imatinib, 64%), improvements in progression-free and overall survival and lower rates of transformation to accelerated/blast phase were reported compared with patients with BCR-ABL1 greater than 10% at 3 months. Transformation to accelerated/blast phase occurred in 5% and 7% of patients in the dasatinib and imatinib arms, respectively. Fifteen dasatinib-treated and 19 imatinib-treated patients had BCR-ABL1 mutations identified at discontinuation. There were no new or unexpected adverse events identified in either treatment arm, and pleural effusion was the only drug-related, nonhematologic adverse event reported more frequently with dasatinib (28% v 0.8% with imatinib). First occurrences of pleural effusion were reported with dasatinib, with the highest incidence in year 1. Arterial ischemic events were uncommon in both treatment arms. CONCLUSION: These final results from the DASISION trial continue to support dasatinib 100 mg once daily as a safe and effective first-line therapy for the long-term treatment of CML-CP.","['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Boque, Concepcion', 'Shah, Neil P', 'Chuah, Charles', 'Casanova, Luis', 'Bradley-Garelik, Brigid', 'Manos, George', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Cortes JE', 'Saglio G', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Baccarani M', 'Mayer J', 'Boque C', 'Shah NP', 'Chuah C', 'Casanova L', 'Bradley-Garelik B', 'Manos G', 'Hochhaus A']","[""Jorge E.

One isoform, PML-II, is required for efficient transcription of interferon and interferon-responsive genes. We therefore investigated the PML-II contribution to human adenovirus 5 (Ad5) infection, using shRNA-mediated knockdown. HelaDeltaII cells showed a 2-3-fold elevation in Ad5 yield, reflecting an increase in late gene expression. This increase was found to be due in part to the reduced innate immune response consequent upon PML-II depletion. However, the effect was minor because the viral E4 Orf3 protein targets and inactivates this PML-II function. The major benefit to Ad5 in HelaDeltaII cells was exerted via an increase in HSP70; depletion of HSP70 completely reversed this replicative advantage. Increased Ad5 late gene expression was not due either to the previously described inhibition of inflammatory responses by HSP70 or to effects of HSP70 on major late promoter or L4 promoter activity, but might be linked to an observed increase in E1B 55K, as this protein is known to be required for efficient late gene expression. The induction of HSP70 by PML-II removal was specific for the HSPA1B gene among the HSP70 gene family and thus was not the consequence of a general stress response. Taken together, these data show that PML-II, through its various actions, has an overall negative effect on the Ad5 lifecycle.","['Atwan, Zeenah', 'Wright, Jordan', 'Woodman, Andrew', 'Leppard, Keith N']","['Atwan Z', 'Wright J', 'Woodman A', 'Leppard KN']","['University of Warwick, School of Life Sciences, Gibbet Hill Road, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.', 'University of Warwick, School of Life Sciences, Gibbet Hill Road, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.', 'University of Warwick, School of Life Sciences, Gibbet Hill Road, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.', 'University of Warwick, School of Life Sciences, Gibbet Hill Road, Coventry CV4 7AL, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160523,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Adenoviruses, Human/*immunology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferons/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/05/25 06:00,2017/05/10 06:00,['2016/05/25 06:00'],"['2016/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/jgv.0.000510 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2016 Aug;97(8):1955-1967. doi: 10.1099/jgv.0.000510.

Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a heterodimeric oncoprotein that is aberrantly overexpressed in most TNBC. The present studies show that targeting the oncogenic MUC1 C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) in TNBC cells with silencing or pharmacologic inhibition with GO-203 is associated with downregulation of MCL-1 levels. Targeting MUC1-C suppresses the MEK --> ERK and PI3K --> AKT pathways, and in turn destabilizes MCL-1. The small molecules ABT-737 and ABT-263 target BCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-w, but not MCL-1. We show that treatment with ABT-737 increases reactive oxygen species and thereby MUC1-C expression. In this way, MUC1-C is upregulated in TNBC cells resistant to ABT-737 or ABT-263. We also demonstrate that MUC1-C is necessary for the resistance-associated increases in MCL-1 levels. Significantly, combining GO-203 with ABT-737 is synergistic in inhibiting survival of parental and drug resistant TNBC cells. These findings indicate that targeting MUC1-C is a potential strategy for reversing MCL-1-mediated resistance in TNBC.","['Hiraki, Masayuki', 'Suzuki, Yozo', 'Alam, Maroof', 'Hinohara, Kunihiko', 'Hasegawa, Masanori', 'Jin, Caining', 'Kharbanda, Surender', 'Kufe, Donald']","['Hiraki M', 'Suzuki Y', 'Alam M', 'Hinohara K', 'Hasegawa M', 'Jin C', 'Kharbanda S', 'Kufe D']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Harvard Medical School Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Harvard Medical School Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Harvard Medical School Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Harvard Medical School Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Harvard Medical School Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Harvard Medical School Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Harvard Medical School Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Harvard Medical School Boston, MA 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160524,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MUC1 protein, human)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mucin-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",,,2016/05/25 06:00,2018/03/30 06:00,['2016/05/25 06:00'],"['2016/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['srep26643 [pii]', '10.1038/srep26643 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 May 24;6:26643. doi: 10.1038/srep26643.,10.1038/srep26643 [doi],"['R01 CA097098/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166480/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4877578,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A single-nucleotide polymorphism of transcription factor growth factor independence 1 (GFI1) generates a protein with an asparagine at position 36 (GFI1(36N)) instead of a serine at position 36 (GFI1(36S)), which is associated with de novo AML in humans. However, how GFI1(36N) predisposes to AML is poorly understood. To explore the mechanism, we used knock-in mouse strains expressing GFI1(36N) or GFI1(36S). Presence of GFI1(36N) shortened the latency and increased the incidence of AML in different murine models of myelodysplastic syndrome/AML. On a molecular level, GFI1(36N) induced genomewide epigenetic changes, leading to expression of AML-associated genes. On a therapeutic level, use of histone acetyltransferase inhibitors specifically impeded growth of GFI1(36N)-expressing human and murine AML cells in vitro and in vivo. These results establish, as a proof of principle, how epigenetic changes in GFI1(36N)-induced AML can be targeted.","['Botezatu, Lacramioara', 'Michel, Lars C', 'Helness, Anne', 'Vadnais, Charles', 'Makishima, Hideki', 'Hones, Judith M', 'Robert, Francois', 'Vassen, Lothar', 'Thivakaran, Aniththa', 'Al-Matary, Yahya', 'Lams, Robert F', 'Schutte, Judith', 'Giebel, Bernd', 'Gorgens, Andre', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Medyouf, Hind', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Moroy, Tarik', 'Khandanpour, Cyrus']","['Botezatu L', 'Michel LC', 'Helness A', 'Vadnais C', 'Makishima H', 'Hones JM', 'Robert F', 'Vassen L', 'Thivakaran A', 'Al-Matary Y', 'Lams RF', 'Schutte J', 'Giebel B', 'Gorgens A', 'Heuser M', 'Medyouf H', 'Maciejewski J', 'Duhrsen U', 'Moroy T', 'Khandanpour C']","['Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada; Departement de medecine, Faculte de medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Hematology, West German Cancer Center, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada; Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany; Departement de microbiologie, infectiologie et immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.

Genome-wide studies have located LEDGF/p75 inside actively transcribed genes where it mediates lentiviral integration. Although its role in HIV-1 integration is clearly established, the role of LEDGF/p75-associated proteins in HIV-1 infection remains unexplored. Using protein-protein interaction assays, we demonstrated that LEDGF/p75 complexes with a chromatin-remodeling complex facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT), a heterodimer of the structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP1) and the human homolog of suppressor of Ty 16 (hSpt16). Detailed analysis of the interaction of LEDGF/p75 with the FACT complex indicates that LEDGF/p75 interacts with SSRP1 in an hSpt16-independent manner that requires the PWWP domain of LEDGF proteins and the HMG domain of SSRP1. Functional characterizations demonstrate a LEDGF/p75-independent role of SSRP1 in the regulation of HIV-1 replication. shRNA-mediated partial knockdown of SSRP1 reduces HIV-1 infection, but not Murine Leukemia Virus, in human CD4(+) T cells. Similarly, SSRP1 knockdown affects infection by HIV-1-derived viruses that express genes from the viral LTR but not from an internal immediate-early CMV promoter, suggesting a role of SSRP1 in LTR-driven gene expression but not in viral DNA integration. Together, our data demonstrate for the first time the association of LEDGF proteins with the FACT complex and give further support to a role of SSRP1 in HIV-1 infection.","['Lopez, Angelica P', 'Kugelman, Jeffrey R', 'Garcia-Rivera, Jose', 'Urias, Eduardo', 'Salinas, Sandra A', 'Fernandez-Zapico, Martin E', 'Llano, Manuel']","['Lopez AP', 'Kugelman JR', 'Garcia-Rivera J', 'Urias E', 'Salinas SA', 'Fernandez-Zapico ME', 'Llano M']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968, USA.', 'Schulze Center for Novel Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.

This international phase 3 study compared the efficacy and tolerance of the standard therapy with a potentially less toxic combination consisting of bendamustine and rituximab. METHODS: Treatment-naive fit patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (aged 33-81 years) without del(17p) were enrolled after undergoing a central screening process. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a computer-generated randomisation list using randomly permuted blocks with a block size of eight and were stratified according to participating country and Binet stage. Patients were allocated to receive six cycles of intravenous fludarabine (25 mg/m(2) per day) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m(2) per day) for the first 3 days or to intravenous bendamustine (90 mg/m(2) per day) for the first 2 days of each cycle. Rituximab 375 mg/m(2) was given intravenously in both groups on day 0 of cycle 1 and subsequently was given at 500 mg/m(2) during the next five cycles on day 1. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival with the objective to assess non-inferiority of bendamustine and rituximab to the standard therapy. We aimed to show that the 2-year progression-free survival with bendamustine and rituximab was not 67.5% or less with a corresponding non-inferiority margin of 1.388 for the hazard ratio (HR) based on the 90.4% CI. The final analysis was done by intention to treat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT%2000769522. FINDINGS: 688 patients were recruited between Oct 2, 2008, and July 11, 2011, of which 564 patients who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned. 561 patients were included in the intention-to-treat population: 282 patients in the fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab group and 279 in the bendamustine and rituximab group. After a median observation time of 37.1 months (IQR 31.0-45.5) median progression-free survival was 41.7 months (95% CI 34.9-45.3) with bendamustine and rituximab and 55.2 months (95% CI not evaluable) with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (HR 1.643, 90.4% CI 1.308-2.064). As the upper limit of the 90.4% CI was greater than 1.388 the null hypothesis for the corresponding non-inferiority hypothesis was not rejected. Severe neutropenia and infections were more frequently observed with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (235 [84%] of 279 vs 164 [59%] of 278, and 109 [39%] vs 69 [25%], respectively) during the study. The increased frequency of infectious complications with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab was more pronounced in patients older than 65 years. INTERPRETATION: The combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab remains the standard front-line therapy in fit patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but bendamustine and rituximab is associated with less toxic effects.

These tests can detect genetic mutations that do not have any morphological correlate in hematologic neoplasia such as myelo - dysplastic syndrome (MDS). A new entity was recently defined to lessen the risk of incorrect diagnoses of MDS. This new entity is a potential precursor of myeloid diseases, analogously to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance as a potential precursor of multiple myeloma. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent articles retrieved by a selective search in PubMed employing the terms ""clonal hematopoiesis,"" ""acute myeloid leukemia,"" and ""myelodysplastic syndrome."" RESULTS: Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a new entity in which somatic mutations are found in cells of the blood or bone marrow, but no other criteria for hematologic neoplasia are met. Its prevalence rises with age and is roughly 10% among persons aged 70 to 80. It is estimated that, in Germany, about 2.75 million people are affected. The most common mutation is on the DNMT3A gene, followed by TET2 and ASXL1. The rate of transformation to a hematological neoplasia is 0.5-1% per year, and thus about 13 times higher than the incidence of such neoplasias in general. If CHIP is discovered incidentally in a patient with a normal blood count, a complete blood count with differential should be repeated three months later and then at annual intervals. CONCLUSION: CHIP must be included in the differential diagnosis of peripheral blood cytopenia. This new entity can help us understand the clinical significance of clonal hematopoiesis.","['Heuser, Michael', 'Thol, Felicitas', 'Ganser, Arnold']","['Heuser M', 'Thol F', 'Ganser A']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Genetic Testing/methods', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/classification/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors']",,,2016/05/25 06:00,2018/01/27 06:00,['2016/05/25 06:00'],"['2015/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2015/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['arztebl.2016.0317 [pii]', '10.3238/arztebl.2016.0317 [doi]']",ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2016 May 6;113(18):317-22. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2016.0317.,10.3238/arztebl.2016.0317 [doi] arztebl.2016.0317 [pii],,PMC4961884,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional cytogenetic analysis supplemented with locus-specific FISH analyses is gold standard to detect important clonal aberrations in this disease group. However, adequate chromosome banding analysis may often be hampered by poor chromosome morphology and banding patterns in pediatric ALL cases, which may hinder identification of possible clinical important additional chromosomal aberrations. We used oligo-based high-resolution aCGH (oaCGH) analysis as an adjunct tool to enhance conventional cytogenetic analysis in pediatric acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia in a prospective single center study during a 4-year period (2012-2015). In a consecutive series of 45 pediatric B-ALLs, we identified eight patients with t(12;21)/ETV6-RUNX1 fusion by FISH analysis. In three of the patients, oaCGH analysis revealed concurrent Xq duplication and 6q deletion, which was cryptic by G-banded analysis. FISH analyses with whole chromosome painting probes confirmed the imbalances and showed an unbalanced translocation der(6)t(X;6) in all three patients. A search in the literature revealed two additional pediatric patients with cryptic der(6)t(X;6) in t(12;21)-positive ALLs. No common break points on Xq or 6q could be determined between the five patients. This study highlights the importance of oaCGH analysis as an adjunct cytogenetic tool to detect cryptic chromosomal aberrations. Further, the study adds to understanding the full spectrum of secondary chromosomal aberrations in the very common t(12;21)-positive pediatric ALL disease group. We suggest that the unbalanced der(6)t(X;6), which is cryptic to conventional cytogenetics, is a non-random secondary event in this disease group. It might be that the specific combination of concurrent Xq duplication and 6q-deletion results in gain of possible oncogenes on Xq and loss of possible tumor suppressor genes on 6q that are important for the leukemic propagation of t(12;21)-positive hematopoietic cells in a subset of ALLs.","['Kjeldsen, Eigil']",['Kjeldsen E'],"['Hemodiagnostic Laboratory, Cancer Cytogenetics Section, Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Tage-Hansens Gade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.

The evaluation for photoactivation and cytotoxicity of the novel carboxylated diiodido-Pt(IV) cytotoxic prodrugs by near-infrared (NIR) light (lambda = 980 nm) is also reported. We attempted two different strategies for attachment of light-sensitive diiodido-Pt(IV) complexes to Yb,Er- and Yb,Tm-doped beta-NaGdF4 upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) in order to provide nanohybrids, which offer unique opportunities for selective drug activation within the tumor cells and subsequent spatiotemporal controlled drug release by NIR-to-visible light-upconversion: (A) covalent attachment of the Pt(IV) complex via amide bond formation and (B) carboxylate exchange of oleate on the surface of the UCNPs with diiodido-Pt(IV) carboxylato complexes. Initial feasibility studies showed that NIR applied by a 980 nm laser had only a slight effect on the stability of the various diiodido-Pt(IV) complexes, but when UCNPs were present more rapid loss of the ligand-metal-charge transfer (LMCT) bands of the diiodido-Pt(IV) complexes was observed. Furthermore, Pt released from the Pt(IV) complexes platinated calf-thymus DNA (ct-DNA) more rapidly when NIR was applied compared to dark controls. Of the two attachment strategies, method A with the covalently attached diiodido-Pt(IV) carboxylates via amide bond formation proved to be the most effective method for generating UCNPs that release Pt when irradiated with NIR; the released Pt was also able to bind irreversibly to calf thymus DNA. Nonetheless, only ca. 20% of the Pt on the surface of the UCNPs was in the Pt(IV) oxidation state, the rest was Pt(II), indicating chemical reduction of the diiodido-Pt(IV) prodrug by the UCNPs. Cytotoxicity studies with the various UCNP-Pt conjugates and constructs, tested on human leukemia HL60 cells in culture, indicated a substantial increase in cytotoxicity when modified UCNPs were combined with five rounds of 30 min irradiation with NIR compared to dark controls, but NIR alone also had a significant cytotoxic effect at this duration.","['Perfahl, Stefanie', 'Natile, Marta M', 'Mohamad, Heba S', 'Helm, Christiane A', 'Schulzke, Carola', 'Natile, Giovanni', 'Bednarski, Patrick J']","['Perfahl S', 'Natile MM', 'Mohamad HS', 'Helm CA', 'Schulzke C', 'Natile G', 'Bednarski PJ']","['Institute of Pharmacy, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greifswald , 17487 Greifswald, Germany.', 'CNR-ICMATE, Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Padova , 35131 Padova, Italy.', 'Institute of Physics, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greifswald , 17487 Greifswald, Germany.', 'Institute of Physics, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greifswald , 17487 Greifswald, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greifswald , 17489 Greifswald, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Bari , 70125 Bari, Italy.', 'Institute of Pharmacy, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt University of Greifswald , 17487 Greifswald, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160606,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '91080-16-9 (calf thymus DNA)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/chemistry', 'Photochemistry/*methods', 'Prodrugs/*chemistry', 'X-Ray Diffraction']",['NOTNLM'],"['*anticancer prodrug', '*photoactivatable Pt complexes', '*photoactivated chemotherapy', '*upconverting nanoparticles']",2016/05/25 06:00,2017/10/21 06:00,['2016/05/25 06:00'],"['2016/05/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00108 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2016 Jul 5;13(7):2346-62. doi: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b00108.

Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells often share the Treg phenotype and also express CCR4. Although mogamulizumab, a monoclonal antibody to CCR4, shows marked antitumor effects against ATL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, concerns have been raised that it may induce severe autoimmune immunopathology by depleting eTregs. Here, we present case reports for two patients with ATL who responded to mogamulizumab but developed a severe skin rash and autoimmune brainstem encephalitis. Deep sequencing of the T-cell receptor revealed that ATL cells and naturally occurring Tregs within the cell population with a Treg phenotype can be clearly distinguished according to CADM1 expression. The onset of skin rash and brainstem encephalitis was coincident with eTreg depletion from the peripheral blood, whereas ATL relapses were coincident with eTreg recovery. These results imply that eTreg numbers in the peripheral blood sensitively reflect the equilibrium between antitumor immunity and autoimmunity, and that mogamulizumab might suppress ATL until the eTreg population recovers.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective method of treating CDI by correcting intestinal dysbiosis by passive transfer of healthy donor microflora. FMT has not been widely used in immunocompromised patients, including HSCT recipients, owing to concern for donor-derived infection. Here, we describe initial results of an FMT program for CDI at a US HSCT center. Seven HSCT recipients underwent FMT between February 2015 and February 2016. Mean time post HSCT was 635 days (25-75 interquartile range [IQR] 38-791). Five of the patients (71.4%) were on immunosuppressive therapy at FMT; 4 had required long-term suppressive oral vancomycin therapy because of immediate recurrence after antibiotic cessation. Stool donors underwent comprehensive health and behavioral screening and laboratory testing of serum and stool for 32 potential pathogens. FMT was administered via the naso-jejunal route in 6 of the 7 patients. Mean follow-up was 265 days (IQR 51-288). Minor post-FMT adverse effects included self-limited bloating and urgency. One patient was suspected of having post-FMT small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. No serious adverse events were noted and all-cause mortality was 0%. Six of 7 (85.7%) patients had no recurrence; 1 patient recurred at day 156 post FMT after taking an oral antibiotic and required repeat FMT, after which no recurrence has occurred. Diarrhea was improved in all patients and 1 patient with gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease was able to taper off systemic immunosuppression after FMT. With careful donor selection and laboratory screening, FMT appears to be a safe and effective therapy for CDI in HSCT patients and may confer additional benefits. Larger studies are necessary to confirm safety and efficacy and explore other possible effects.","['Webb, B J', 'Brunner, A', 'Ford, C D', 'Gazdik, M A', 'Petersen, F B', 'Hoda, D']","['Webb BJ', 'Brunner A', 'Ford CD', 'Gazdik MA', 'Petersen FB', 'Hoda D']","['Division of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases, Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Intermountain Acute Leukemia/Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Intermountain Acute Leukemia/Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases, Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Intermountain Acute Leukemia/Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.', 'Intermountain Acute Leukemia/Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20160705,Denmark,Transpl Infect Dis,Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,100883688,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Clostridioides difficile/*isolation & purification', 'Clostridium Infections/microbiology/*therapy', 'Diarrhea/microbiology/*therapy', 'Dysbiosis/complications/*therapy', '*Fecal Microbiota Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/mortality', 'Feces/chemistry/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/immunology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects/methods', 'Intestines/microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Clostridium difficile infection', 'fecal microbiota transplantation', 'graft-versus-host disease', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'microbiome']",2016/05/24 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/05/24 06:00'],"['2016/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/16 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/tid.12550 [doi]'],ppublish,Transpl Infect Dis. 2016 Aug;18(4):628-33. doi: 10.1111/tid.12550.

We sequenced 27 genes in 150 SM patients to identify mutations that could be integrated into a clinical-molecular prognostic model for survival. Forty four patients (29%) had ISM, 25 (17%) ASM, 80 (53%) SM-AHN and 1 (0.7%) MCL; overall KITD816V prevalence was 75%. In 87 patients, 148 non-KIT mutations were detected; the most frequently mutated genes were TET2 (29%), ASXL1 (17%), and CBL (11%), with significantly higher mutation frequency in SM-AHN > ASM > ISM (P < 0.0001). In advanced SM, ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations were associated with inferior survival. In multivariate analysis, age > 60 years (HR = 2.4), hemoglobin < 10 g/dL or transfusion-dependence (HR = 1.7), platelet count < 150 x 10(9) /L (HR = 3.2), serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL (HR = 2.6), and ASXL1 mutation (HR = 2.3) were associated with inferior survival. A mutation-augmented prognostic scoring system (MAPSS) based on these parameters stratified advanced SM patients into high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups with median survival of 5, 21 and 86 months, respectively (P < 0.0001).

Eligible studies were prospective, interventional, and reported World Health Organization, French-American-British, or International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) criteria. Outcomes included erythroid response rate (primary); haemoglobin response; change in haemoglobin, transfusion status, and quality-of-life (QoL); and safety. Ten studies (N = 647) were analysed. Erythroid response rate range was 38-72%; median response duration range was 12-51+ months. Patients with erythropoietin (EPO) <100 iu/l had 35% [95% confidence interval (CI): 22-48%; P < 0.001) better response than patients with EPO >100 iu/l. Erythropoesis-stimulating agent (ESA)-naive patients had 17% (95% CI: 3-32%; P = 0.022) greater response rate than those previously treated with ESA. Nonetheless, previously treated patients had response rates of 25-75%. Higher baseline haemoglobin levels, higher dose, transfusion-independence and low-risk IPSS status were reported by several studies to be associated with better response. QoL, transfusion rates and haemoglobin levels improved with treatment. Hypertension, thromboembolism and progression to acute myeloid leukaemia were reported in 2%, 1% and 1% of patients, respectively. This meta-analysis suggests that DA treatment can be useful for improving erythroid response in MDS patients with anaemia, even among patients previously treated with ESA.","['Park, Sophie', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Greenberg, Peter', 'Mehta, Bhakti', 'Callaghan, Fiona', 'Kim, Christopher', 'Tomita, Dianne', 'Xu, Hairong']","['Park S', 'Fenaux P', 'Greenberg P', 'Mehta B', 'Callaghan F', 'Kim C', 'Tomita D', 'Xu H']","[""CHU de Grenoble, Clinique Universitaire d'Hematologie, Universite Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France."", 'Hopital St Louis/Universite Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20160523,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '15UQ94PT4P (Darbepoetin alfa)']",IM,"['Blood Transfusion/statistics & numerical data', 'Darbepoetin alfa/*therapeutic use', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*darbepoetin alpha', '*meta-analysis', '*myelodysplastic syndromes', '*systematic review']",2016/05/24 06:00,2017/06/07 06:00,['2016/05/24 06:00'],"['2015/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.14116 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2016 Sep;174(5):730-47. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14116.

However, in some individual cases, these treatment scenarios cannot be applied. We used an alternative treatment strategy with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) given solo, sequentially or together with TKI in a group of 6 cases of high risk CML patients, assuming that the TKI-independent mechanism of action may lead to mutant clone repression. IFN-alpha based individualized therapy decreases of T315I or compound mutations to undetectable levels as assessed by next-generation deep sequencing, which was associated with a molecular response in 4/6 patients. Based on the observed results from immune profiling, we assumed that the principal mechanism leading to the success of the treatment was the immune activation induced with dasatinib pre-treatment followed by restoration of immunological surveillance after application of IFN-alpha therapy. Moreover, we showed that sensitive measurement of mutated BCR-ABL1 transcript levels augments the safety of this individualized treatment strategy.","['Polivkova, Vaclava', 'Rohon, Peter', 'Klamova, Hana', 'Cerna, Olga', 'Divoka, Martina', 'Curik, Nikola', 'Zach, Jan', 'Novak, Martin', 'Marinov, Iuri', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Faber, Edgar', 'Machova Polakova, Katerina']","['Polivkova V', 'Rohon P', 'Klamova H', 'Cerna O', 'Divoka M', 'Curik N', 'Zach J', 'Novak M', 'Marinov I', 'Soverini S', 'Faber E', 'Machova Polakova K']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and Faculty Hospital, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Clinical and Experimental Hematology of the 1st Medicine Faculty, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, 3rd Faculty of Medicine and Faculty Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and Faculty Hospital, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University and Faculty Hospital, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology ""L. e A.

However, current models do not fully mimic the components of the human bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, and they enable only limited engraftment of samples from some human malignancies. Here we show that a xenotransplantation model bearing subcutaneous humanized ossicles with an accessible BM microenvironment, formed by in situ differentiation of human BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cells, enables the robust engraftment of healthy human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, as well as primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, at levels much greater than those in unmanipulated mice. Direct intraossicle transplantation accelerated engraftment and resulted in the detection of substantially higher leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) frequencies. We also observed robust engraftment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and myelofibrosis (MF) samples, and identified LICs in these malignancies.

We compared income between survivors and siblings, and determined factors associated with income. METHODS: As part of the Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (SCCSS), a questionnaire was sent to survivors, aged >/=18 years, registered in the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry (SCCR), diagnosed at age <21 years, who had survived >/=5 years after diagnosis of the primary tumor. Siblings were used as a comparison group. We asked questions about education, profession and income and retrieved clinical data from the SCCR. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with income. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 1'506 survivors and 598 siblings. Survivors were less likely than siblings to have a high monthly income (>4'500 CHF), even after we adjusted for socio-demographic and educational factors (OR = 0.46, p<0.001). Older age, male sex, personal and parental education, and number of working hours were associated with high income. Survivors of leukemia (OR = 0.40, p<0.001), lymphoma (OR = 0.63, p = 0.040), CNS tumors (OR = 0.22, p<0.001), bone tumors (OR = 0.24, p = 0.003) had a lower income than siblings. Survivors who had cranial irradiation, had a lower income than survivors who had no cranial irradiation (OR = 0.48, p = 0.006). DISCUSSION: Even after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, education and working hours, survivors of various diagnostic groups have lower incomes than siblings. Further research needs to identify the underlying causes.","['Wengenroth, Laura', 'Sommer, Grit', 'Schindler, Matthias', 'Spycher, Ben D', 'von der Weid, Nicolas X', 'Stutz-Grunder, Eveline', 'Michel, Gisela', 'Kuehni, Claudia E']","['Wengenroth L', 'Sommer G', 'Schindler M', 'Spycher BD', 'von der Weid NX', 'Stutz-Grunder E', 'Michel G', 'Kuehni CE']","['Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Occupational, Social and Environmental Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munich, Germany.', 'Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', ""Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Unit, University Children's Hospital Basel (UKBB), University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Unit, University Hospital Bern (Inselspital), Bern Switzerland.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Health Policy, University of Lucerne, Lucerne, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160523,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Educational Status', 'Employment/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Income/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/rehabilitation', 'Siblings', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Survivors/statistics & numerical data', 'Switzerland/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/05/24 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2016/05/24 06:00'],"['2015/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0155546 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-54937 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 May 23;11(5):e0155546. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0155546. eCollection 2016.,10.1371/journal.pone.0155546 [doi],,PMC4877063,,,,,,,,['Swiss Paediatric Oncology Group (SPOG)'],,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled and 36 patients were treated (24 in cohort A; 12 in cohort B). The cohort A dose schedule resulted in problematic cumulative toxicity, while the cohort B dose schedule was found to be more tolerable. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was pemetrexed 750 mg/m2 every 14 days with oral sorafenib 400 mg given twice daily on days 1-5. Because dosing delays and modifications were associated with the MTD, the recommended phase II dose was declared to be pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 every 14 days with oral sorafenib 400 mg given twice daily on days 1-5. Thirty-three patients were evaluated for antitumor activity. One complete response and 4 partial responses were observed (15% overall response rate). Stable disease was seen in 15 patients (45%). Four patients had a continued response at 6 months, including 2 of 5 patients with triple-negative breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A phase I trial employing a standard 3 + 3 design was conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors. Cohort A involved a novel dose escalation schema exploring doses of pemetrexed every 14 days with continuous sorafenib. Cohort B involved a modified schedule of sorafenib dosing on days 1-5 of each 14-day pemetrexed cycle. Radiographic assessments were conducted every 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Pemetrexed and intermittent sorafenib therapy is a safe and tolerable combination for patients, with promising activity seen in patients with breast cancer.","['Poklepovic, Andrew',

In this review, we detail the background biology on telomere maintenance in health and disease, then concentrate on the recent preclinical and clinical development behind targeting telomerase in blood cancers. RECENT FINDINGS: Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that imetelstat, a competitive inhibitor of telomerase, has activity in certain hematologic malignancies, in particular the myeloproliferative neoplasms and acute myeloid leukemia. SUMMARY: Telomerase inhibition has shown remarkable efficacy in myeloid malignancies, and current and future preclinical and clinical studies are necessary to comprehensively investigate its underlying mechanism of action. Future work should identify the potential genetic susceptibilities to telomerase inhibition therapy, and evaluate rational combinations of telomerase inhibitors with chemotherapy and other novel agents. Robust preclinical evaluation is essential to best translate these new agents successfully into our clinical treatment algorithm for myeloid and other blood cancers.","['Bruedigam, Claudia', 'Lane, Steven W']","['Bruedigam C', 'Lane SW']","[""aDivision of Immunology, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute bRoyal Brisbane and Women's Hospital Cancer Care Services cUniversity of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Clinical Studies as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Telomerase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere Homeostasis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2016/05/24 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2016/05/24 06:00'],"['2016/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000252 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2016 Jul;23(4):346-53. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000252.,10.1097/MOH.0000000000000252 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although, the molecular alterations leading to CLL onset and progression are still under investigation (specifically, the interplay and exact role of oncogenes and tumor suppressors in CLL pathogenesis). MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are expressed in a tissue specific manner. Deregulation of microRNAs can alter expression levels of genes involved in the development and/or progression of tumors. In CLL, microRNAs can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Here, we review the most recent findings on the role of microRNAs in the onset/progression of CLL, and how this knowledge can be used to identify new biomarkers and targets to treat this leukemia.","['Balatti, Veronica', 'Acunzo, Mario', 'Pekarky, Yuri', 'Croce, Carlo M']","['Balatti V', 'Acunzo M', 'Pekarky Y', 'Croce CM']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wexner Medical Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Trends Cancer,Trends in cancer,101665956,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'miR-15/16', 'microRNA']",2016/05/24 06:00,2016/05/24 06:00,['2016/05/24 06:00'],"['2016/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1016/j.trecan.2016.02.005 [doi]'],ppublish,Trends Cancer. 2016 Mar;2(3):134-143. doi: 10.1016/j.trecan.2016.02.005.,,"['P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197706/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4874335,,,,,,['NIHMS785197'],,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies showed that the cytotoxicity of ATO mainly depends on the induction of reactive oxygen species. However, ATO has only achieved a modest effect in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, suggesting that the existing radical scavenging proteins, such as hypoxia inducible factor-1, attenuate the effect. The goal of this study is to investigate the effect of combination treatment of ATO plus PX-478 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1 inhibitor) and its underlying mechanism. Here, we showed that PX-478 robustly strengthened the anti-growth and pro-apoptosis effect of ATO on Panc-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Meanwhile, in vivo mouse xenograft models also showed the synergistic effect of ATO plus PX-478 compared with any single agent. Further studies showed that the anti-tumor effect of ATO plus PX-478 was derived from the reactive oxygen species-induced apoptosis. We next confirmed that Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 cleared reactive oxygen species by its downstream target, forkhead box O transcription factors, and this effect may justify the strategy of ATO plus PX-478 in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","['Lang, Mingxiao', 'Wang, Xiuchao', 'Wang, Hongwei', 'Dong, Jie', 'Lan, Chungen', 'Hao, Jihui', 'Huang, Chongbiao', 'Li, Xin', 'Yu, Ming', 'Yang, Yanhui', 'Yang, Shengyu', 'Ren, He']","['Lang M', 'Wang X', 'Wang H', 'Dong J', 'Lan C', 'Hao J', 'Huang C', 'Li X', 'Yu M', 'Yang Y', 'Yang S', 'Ren H']","['National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Department of Pancreatic Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Department of Pancreatic Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Department of Pancreatic Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Department of Pancreatic Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Department of Pancreatic Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Department of Pancreatic Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Department of Pancreatic Cancer, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', '2011 Collaborative Innovation Center of Tianjin for Medical Epigenetics, Key Laboratory of Hormones and Development (Ministry of Health), Metabolic Diseases Hospital & Tianjin Institute of Endocrinology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Tumor Biology and Comprehensive Melanoma Research Center, H.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-nine Chinese pediatric BP-ALL were enrolled in this study between Dec 2008 and Sep 2013 in two stratified cohorts. One hundred and fifty-three patients enrolled between Dec 2008 and Oct 2010 as the first cohort, and 196 patients enrolled from Nov 2010 to Sep 2013 as the second cohort. Clinical and biological characteristics and 5 years EFS, RFS, and OS were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with E2A-PBX1 showed a favorable treatment response with a lower minimal residual disease (MRD) level (< 10-4) at the time point 1 (TP1, p = 0.039) and the highest proportion of the 5-year EFS, RFS, and OS. A high level of MRD was associated with high WBC counts, increased age, BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, MLL rearrangements and adverse karyotypes. In comparison with the first cohort, the second cohort with the MRD assay incorporated prospectively, the standard risk (SR) and the intermediate risk (IR) patients showed a better RFS, EFS, and OS while the high-risk (HR) patients displayed worse RFS, EFS, and OS than those of the first cohort, respectively. Patients with MRD level at either 10-4 or 10-3 showed a similar OS at TP1 or TP2, and patients with MRD level above 10-2 had the worst OS. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that the levels of MRD to be an adequate guide in risk-adapted treatment under the CCLG-ALL-2008 protocol and can be adapted to the future development of advanced clinical protocols.","['Hu, Y-X', 'Lu, J', 'He, H-L', 'Wang, Y', 'Li, J-Q', 'Xiao, P-F', 'Li, J', 'Lv, H', 'Sun, Y-N', 'Fan, J-J', 'Chai, Y-H', 'Hu, S-Y']","['Hu YX', 'Lu J', 'He HL', 'Wang Y', 'Li JQ', 'Xiao PF', 'Li J', 'Lv H', 'Sun YN', 'Fan JJ', 'Chai YH', 'Hu SY']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. hsy139@126.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk']",,,2016/05/24 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2016/05/24 06:00'],"['2016/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2016 May;20(9):1680-90.,10735 [pii],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unregulated changes in cellular redox homeostasis are associated with the onset of most hematological disorders. However, accurate measurement of the redox state in stem cells is difficult because of the scarcity of HSC/MPPs. Glutathione (GSH) constitutes the most abundant pool of cellular antioxidants. Thus, GSH metabolism may play a critical role in hematological disease onset and progression. A major limitation to studying GSH metabolism in HSC/MPPs has been the inability to measure quantitatively GSH concentrations in small numbers of HSC/MPPs. Current methods used to measure GSH levels not only rely on large numbers of cells, but also rely on the chemical/structural modification or enzymatic recycling of GSH and therefore are likely to measure only total glutathione content accurately. Here, we describe the validation of a sensitive method used for the direct and simultaneous quantitation of both oxidized and reduced GSH via liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in HSC/MPPs isolated from bone marrow. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was determined to be 5.0ng/mL for GSH and 1.0ng/mL for GSSG with lower limits of detection at 0.5ng/mL for both glutathione species. Standard addition analysis utilizing mouse bone marrow shows that this method is both sensitive and accurate with reproducible analyte recovery.

Yet recent studies also suggest a tumor suppressive role of NOTCH signaling in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and reactivation of this pathway offers an attractive opportunity for anti-AML therapies. N-methylhemeanthidine chloride (NMHC) is a novel Amaryllidaceae alkaloid that we previously isolated from Zephyranthes candida, exhibiting inhibitory activities in a variety of cancer cells, particularly those from AML. Here, we report NMHC not only selectively inhibits AML cell proliferation in vitro but also hampers tumor development in a human AML xenograft model. Genome-wide gene expression profiling reveals that NMHC activates the NOTCH signaling. Combination of NMHC and recombinant human NOTCH ligand DLL4 achieves a remarkable synergistic effect on NOTCH activation. Moreover, pre-inhibition of NOTCH by overexpression of dominant negative MAML alleviates NMHC-mediated cytotoxicity in AML. Further mechanistic analysis using structure-based molecular modeling as well as biochemical assays demonstrates that NMHC docks in the hydrophobic cavity within the NOTCH1 negative regulatory region (NRR), thus promoting NOTCH1 proteolytic cleavage. Our findings thus establish NMHC as a potential NOTCH agonist that holds great promises for future development as a novel agent beneficial to patients with AML.","['Ye, Qi', 'Jiang, Jue', 'Zhan, Guanqun', 'Yan, Wanyao', 'Huang, Liang', 'Hu, Yufeng', 'Su, Hexiu', 'Tong, Qingyi', 'Yue, Ming', 'Li, Hua', 'Yao, Guangmin', 'Zhang, Yonghui', 'Liu, Hudan']","['Ye Q', 'Jiang J', 'Zhan G', 'Yan W', 'Huang L', 'Hu Y', 'Su H', 'Tong Q', 'Yue M', 'Li H', 'Yao G', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu H']","['Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', ""Department of Pharmacy, Wuhan Children's Hospital, Wuhan, 430016, China."", 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, School of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430030, China.', 'Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160523,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (delta protein)']",IM,"['Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Receptor, Notch1/chemistry/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2016/05/24 06:00,2018/05/23 06:00,['2016/05/24 06:00'],"['2016/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['srep26510 [pii]', '10.1038/srep26510 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 May 23;6:26510. doi: 10.1038/srep26510.,10.1038/srep26510 [doi],,PMC4876435,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMOylation, the process of covalently conjugating small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs), is required for both the formation and the disruption of PML-NBs. However, detailed mechanisms of how SUMOylation regulates these processes remain unknown. Here we report that SUMO5, a novel SUMO variant, mediates the growth and disruption of PML-NBs. PolySUMO5 conjugation of PML at lysine 160 facilitates recruitment of PML-NB components, which enlarges PML-NBs. SUMO5 also increases polySUMO2/3 conjugation of PML, resulting in RNF4-mediated disruption of PML-NBs. The acute promyelocytic leukemia oncoprotein PML-RARalpha blocks SUMO5 conjugation of PML, causing cytoplasmic displacement of PML and disruption of PML-NBs. Our work not only identifies a new member of the SUMO family but also reveals the mechanistic basis of the PML-NB life cycle in human cells.","['Liang, Ya-Chen', 'Lee, Chia-Chin', 'Yao, Ya-Li', 'Lai, Chien-Chen', 'Schmitz, M Lienhard', 'Yang, Wen-Ming']","['Liang YC', 'Lee CC', 'Yao YL', 'Lai CC', 'Schmitz ML', 'Yang WM']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Asia University, Taichung 41354, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, Friedrichstrasse 24, Justus-Liebig-University, 35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160523,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNF4 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO3 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism']",,,2016/05/24 06:00,2018/04/24 06:00,['2016/05/24 06:00'],"['2016/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['srep26509 [pii]', '10.1038/srep26509 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 May 23;6:26509. doi: 10.1038/srep26509.,10.1038/srep26509 [doi],,PMC4876461,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High dose chemotherapy is tolerated poorly in patients older than 60 years of age and, as treatment is not curative in the elderly, improvement of overall survival and quality of life remains the main goal of management in these patients.

Aberrant splicing events in many downstream target genes were identified and cryptic 3' splice site usage was a frequent event in SF3B1-mutant MDS. The iron transporter ABCB7 is a well-recognized candidate gene showing marked downregulation in MDS with RS. Our analysis unveiled aberrant ABCB7 splicing, due to usage of an alternative 3' splice site in MDS patient samples, giving rise to a premature termination codon in the ABCB7 mRNA.

At week 48, 28% (41/146) of patients randomized to ruxolitinib achieved 35% decrease in spleen volume (primary end point) compared with no patients on BAT (P<0.001). Among the 78 patients (53.4%) in the ruxolitinib arm who achieved 35% reductions in spleen volume at any time, the probability of maintaining response was 0.48 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.35-0.60) at 5 years (median, 3.2 years).

We investigated the methylome of CML patients in chronic phase (CP-CML), accelerated phase (AP-CML) and blast crisis (BC-CML) as well as in controls by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Although only ~600 differentially methylated CpG sites were identified in samples obtained from CP-CML patients compared with controls, ~6500 differentially methylated CpG sites were found in samples from BC-CML patients. In the majority of affected CpG sites, methylation was increased. In CP-CML patients who progressed to AP-CML/BC-CML, we identified up to 897 genes that were methylated at the time of progression but not at the time of diagnosis. Using RNA-sequencing, we observed downregulated expression of many of these genes in BC-CML compared with CP-CML samples. Several of them are well-known tumor-suppressor genes or regulators of cell proliferation, and gene re-expression was observed by the use of epigenetic active drugs. Together, our results demonstrate that CpG site methylation clearly increases during CML progression and that it may provide a useful basis for revealing new targets of therapy in advanced CML.","['Heller, G', 'Topakian, T', 'Altenberger, C', 'Cerny-Reiterer, S', 'Herndlhofer, S', 'Ziegler, B', 'Datlinger, P', 'Byrgazov, K', 'Bock, C', 'Mannhalter, C', 'Hormann, G', 'Sperr, W R', 'Lion, T', 'Zielinski, C C', 'Valent, P', 'Zochbauer-Muller, S']","['Heller G', 'Topakian T', 'Altenberger C', 'Cerny-Reiterer S', 'Herndlhofer S', 'Ziegler B', 'Datlinger P', 'Byrgazov K', 'Bock C', 'Mannhalter C', 'Hormann G', 'Sperr WR', 'Lion T', 'Zielinski CC', 'Valent P', 'Zochbauer-Muller S']","['Department of Medicine I, Clinical Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Clinical Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Clinical Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Clinical Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbrucken, Germany.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Clinical Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Clinical Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160523,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology']",,,2016/05/24 06:00,2017/08/30 06:00,['2016/05/24 06:00'],"['2015/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2016143 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.143 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Sep;30(9):1861-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.143.

Survival outcomes remained poor among early relapse patients irrespective of depth of response to initial therapy. In multivariate analysis, low albumin and high-risk cytogenetics predicted early relapse.

Standard chemotherapy often induces remissions in AML patients, but the disease frequently relapses due to incomplete targeting of leukemia-initiating cells (LICs), emphasizing the need for novel effective treatments. Exportin 1 (XPO1)-mediated nuclear export, which is inhibited by the drug selinexor, is an attractive new therapeutic target in AML. Selinexor has shown impressive activity in Phase I/II clinical trials for AML. Here we report the anti-leukemic efficacy and tolerability of KPT-8602, a second-generation XPO1 inhibitor. KPT-8602 demonstrates substantially reduced brain penetration compared to selinexor, with resultant attenuation of the central nervous system mediated side effects of anorexia and weight loss. Due to its improved tolerability profile, KPT-8602 can be given daily compared to the two or three times weekly regimen of selinexor, and exhibits greater anti-leukemic efficacy against both leukemic blasts and LICs in AML patient-derived xenograft models. Importantly, normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) frequency is not significantly reduced by KPT-8602, providing a therapeutic window for elimination of relapse-driving LICs while sparing normal HSPCs.

Previous work revealed that CREB overexpression augmented AML cell growth, while CREB knockdown disrupted key AML cell functions in vitro. In contrast, CREB knockdown had no effect on long-term hematopoietic stem cell activity in mouse transduction/transplantation assays. Together, these studies position CREB as a promising drug target for AML. To test this concept, a small molecule inhibitor of CREB, XX-650-23, was developed. This molecule blocks a critical interaction between CREB and its required co-activator CBP (CREB Binding Protein), leading to disruption of CREB-driven gene expression. Inhibition of CBP-CREB interaction induced apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in AML cells, and prolonged survival in vivo in mice injected with human AML cells. XX-650-23 had little toxicity on normal human hematopoietic cells and tissues in mice. To understand the mechanism of XX-650-23, we performed RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and Cytometry Time of Flight with human AML cells. Our results demonstrate that small molecule inhibition of CBP-CREB interaction mostly affects apoptotic, cell-cycle and survival pathways, which may represent a novel approach for AML therapy.","['Mitton, B', 'Chae, H-D', 'Hsu, K', 'Dutta, R', 'Aldana-Masangkay, G', 'Ferrari, R', 'Davis, K', 'Tiu, B C', 'Kaul, A', 'Lacayo, N', 'Dahl, G', 'Xie, F', 'Li, B X', 'Breese, M R', 'Landaw, E M', 'Nolan, G', 'Pellegrini, M', 'Romanov, S', 'Xiao, X', 'Sakamoto, K M']","['Mitton B', 'Chae HD', 'Hsu K', 'Dutta R', 'Aldana-Masangkay G', 'Ferrari R', 'Davis K', 'Tiu BC', 'Kaul A', 'Lacayo N', 'Dahl G', 'Xie F', 'Li BX', 'Breese MR', 'Landaw EM', 'Nolan G', 'Pellegrini M', 'Romanov S', 'Xiao X', 'Sakamoto KM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Oregon Health and Sciences University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Oregon Health and Sciences University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Biomathematics, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Nanosyn, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Oregon Health and Sciences University, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160523,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (bone sialoprotein (35-62), human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CREB-Binding Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Mice', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Sialoglycoproteins/metabolism', 'Survival Rate']",,,2016/05/24 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/05/24 06:00'],"['2016/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016139 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.139 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Dec;30(12):2302-2311. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.139.

The high mutation rate of the B-cell receptor (BCR) locus allows high-resolution tracking of the architecture, evolution and clonal dynamics of B-ALL. Using longitudinal BCR repertoire sequencing, we find that the BCR undergoes an unexpectedly high level of clonal diversification in B-ALL cells through both somatic hypermutation and secondary rearrangements, which can be used for tracking the subclonal composition of the disease and detect minimal residual disease with unprecedented sensitivity. We go on to investigate clonal dynamics of B-ALL using BCR phylogenetic analyses of paired diagnosis-relapse samples and find that large numbers of small leukemic subclones present at diagnosis re-emerge at relapse alongside a dominant clone. Our findings suggest that in all informative relapsed patients, the survival of large numbers of clonogenic cells beyond initial chemotherapy is a surrogate for inherent partial chemoresistance or inadequate therapy, providing an increased opportunity for subsequent emergence of fully resistant clones. These results frame early cytoreduction as an important determinant of long-term outcome.","['Bashford-Rogers, R J M', 'Nicolaou, K A', 'Bartram, J', 'Goulden, N J', 'Loizou, L', 'Koumas, L', 'Chi, J', 'Hubank, M', 'Kellam, P', 'Costeas, P A', 'Vassiliou, G S']","['Bashford-Rogers RJ', 'Nicolaou KA', 'Bartram J', 'Goulden NJ', 'Loizou L', 'Koumas L', 'Chi J', 'Hubank M', 'Kellam P', 'Costeas PA', 'Vassiliou GS']","['Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'The Center for the Study of Hematological Malignancies, Nicosia, Cyprus.', 'Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK.', 'Pediatric Oncology/Hematology Clinic, Nicosia, Cyprus.', 'The Center for the Study of Hematological Malignancies, Nicosia, Cyprus.', 'The Center for the Study of Hematological Malignancies, Nicosia, Cyprus.', 'Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health, London, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Division of Infection and Immunity, Research Department of Infection, University College London, London, UK.', 'The Center for the Study of Hematological Malignancies, Nicosia, Cyprus.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'The Center for the Study of Hematological Malignancies, Nicosia, Cyprus.', 'Cambridge Blood and Stem Cell Biobank and Cancer Molecular Diagnosis Laboratory, Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160523,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Cell Survival', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin/genetics']",,,2016/05/24 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/05/24 06:00'],"['2015/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016142 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.142 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Dec;30(12):2312-2321. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.142.

Its impact in AL amyloidosis has not been explored in depth. Newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis patients (n=998) were evaluated for immunoparesis by two methods. The first method was qualitative, considering the number of suppressed uninvolved immunoglobulins below the lower limit of normal (LLN) (none, partial, all). The second method was quantitative, assessing the average relative difference (ARD) of the uninvolved immunoglobulins from the LLN. Patients with suppression of all the uninvolved immunoglobulins were less likely to achieve very good partial response (VGPR) or better to first-line treatment (44%) compared with patients with partial suppression (68%) or preserved uninvolved immunoglobulins (64%; P<0.0001). In addition, patients with suppression of all the uninvolved immunoglobulins had a shorter survival compared with the respective comparators (median 18 vs 54 vs 52 months; P<0.0001). In the quantitative method, patients with a negative ARD were less likely to achieve VGPR or better (48%) and had a shorter survival (median 24 months) compared with patients with a positive ARD (69%, 57 months, respectively; P<0.0001). In a multivariate analysis for survival, both assessment methods retained an independent impact.

METHODS: We collected and analyzed the clinical and laboratory data of 8 CML patients treated in the affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University from September 2011 to July 2015 and Ph(-)CA occurred after TKI therapy. Karyotypes and BCR-ABL fusion genes were analyzed by R-banding and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. RESULTS: 6 cases were male and 2 cases were female, with a median age of 51 (31-75) years old. 6 patients had low Sokal risk scores and 2 had intermediate scores. 4 cases of Ph(-) CA occurred with imatinib, 1 case with dasatinib and 3 cases with nilotinib. The median duration of Ph(-) CA appearance was 12.0 (1.7-34.5) months since taking TKI. Chromosomal abnormality +8 was the most common type in Ph(-)CA, which accounted for 50.0%, followed by -7 (25.0%). When found Ph(-)CA, all patients had complete hematologic response (CHR), but none got main molecular response (MMR). The Ph(-)CA had gone in 7 cases at the end of follow-up and the median duration was 6.2 (2.5-31.5) months. After Ph(-) CA disappeared, 1 patient obtained MMR and 2 cases achieved complete molecular response (CMR), but Ph(+) clone recurred in 1 case. CONCLUSION: Ph(-)CA can be found in CML patients treated with imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib, and +8 is the most common Ph(-)CA. So detection of karyotype is significant during treatment. Although most Ph(-)CA can disappear, -7/7q- or other complex karyotypes should be monitored closely.","['Wang, J', 'Zhang, Yanli', 'Zhou, J', 'Zu, Y L', 'Li, Z', 'Song, Y P']","['Wang J', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhou J', 'Zu YL', 'Li Z', 'Song YP']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450008, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Dasatinib/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",,,2016/05/24 06:00,2017/01/31 06:00,['2016/05/24 06:00'],"['2016/05/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.05.011 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2016 May 14;37(5):412-6. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.05.011.,10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.05.011 [doi],,PMC7348300,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From September 2002 to November 2014 in Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, 97 cases with AML were enrolled, including 96 cases within unfavorable cytogenetic category and an MK case within the intermediate category. The clinical data of MK-positive cases and unfavorable risk MK-negative cases were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 31 MK cases, accounting for 2.5% of the AML patients treated at the same period. Thirty of them were complex aberrant karyotypes defined as showing three or more clonal abnormalities and classified into adverse group based on SWOG criteria. The rest one of these 31 MK was intermediate risk according to SWOG criteria. Among MK cases, the most frequent monosomal chromosome were -17, -5, -7, -21, -8, -22. In 96 cytogenetic unfavorable AML cases, the median OS period was 6.1 months for MK, the median OS period did not reach for non-MK AML (P=0.001). And the median relapse free survival (RFS) period was 3.1 and 18.6 months for MK and non-MK AML (P<0.001), respectively. Both overall survival (OS) and RFS varied significantly between MK and non-MK categories. In 49 complex karyotype AML cases, the median OS was 6.1 and 10.8 months for MK and non-MK AML (P=0.088), respectively. And the median RFS was 3.1 and 8.6 months for MK and non-MK AML (P=0.009), respectively. The RFS varied significantly between MK and non-MK categories.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted to compare the clinical characteristics and prognosis of 118 high-risk APL patients (WBC>/=10 x 10(9)/L) and 234 low and intermedia-risk patients (WBC <10x10(9)/L) from January 2003 to April 2015, who were treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University and Yinzhou People's Hospital affiliated to Medical College of Ningbo University. RESULTS: The initial platelet counts of high-risk APL were significantly lower than that of low and intermediate-risk groups (P=0.003); the major type of PML-RARalpha isoforms in high-risk patients was short-form (51.8% vs 28.2%, P <0.001); the early death (ED) rate of high-risk patients was higher than low and intermedia-risk patients (20.3% vs 2.6%, P<0.001); in contrast, the complete remission (CR) rate and 5 years estimated overall survival (OS) rate of the former were lower than the latter (76.3% vs 94.9%, P <0.001; 74.2% vs 93.7%, P <0.001). However, the CR rate (P=0.682) and 5 years estimated OS rate (P=0.481) did not have difference when the ED patients were excluded. The 5 years estimated relapse-free survival (RFS) and central nervous system (CNS) relapse were 82.7%, 9.4%, respectively, which were lower than low and intermediate-risk groups (87.8%, 1.4% ) with statistic difference (P=0.048, 0.002). High-dose cytarabine and intrathecal chemotherapy may reduce the risk of CNS relapse.

Resistance to treatments and metastasis of leukemia are the main causes of death in patients. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are the initiating cells of leukemia as well as the main source of drug resistance, invasion and metastasis. Consequently, eliminating LSCs is a prerequisite to eradicate leukemia. Preliminary studies in our laboratory have shown that chemokines and their related receptors play an important role in the drug resistance and metastasis of leukemic cells. In this study, we obtained high migration drug-surviving (short term) MOLT4 cells (hMDSCs-MOLT4) with treatment of doxorubicin (DOX) after Transwell assay. Then we detected stem cell-associated molecular markers on hMDSCs-MOLT4 cells and the parental MOLT4 cells by FCM, QPCR, western blotting, H&E staining and immunohisto-chemistry experimental techniques in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we explored its impact on drug resistance and tumor formation. Then we found that compared with the parental MOLT4 cells, the mRNA expression levels of stem cell-related factors Sox2, Oct4, C-myc, Klf4, Nanog, Bmi-1, CXCR4 are increased in hMDSCs-MOLT4 cells, together with the protein expression levels of Sox2, Oct4, Klf4, Nanog, CXCR4 and CD34. Our results indicated that hMDSCs-MOLT4 cells exhibited strong drug resistance and certain cancer stem cell-like characteristics. It is the first indication that the targeting stemness factors such as Sox2, Oct4, Klf4, Nanog and CXCR4 may represent plausible options for eliminating T-ALL stem-like cells. The present findings shed light on the relationship between drug-tolerant leukemic cells and cancer stem cells.","['Huang, Xiaoxing', 'Xiong, Meng', 'Jin, Yujie', 'Deng, Chaohua', 'Xu, Hui', 'An, Changqing', 'Hao, Ling', 'Yang, Xiangyong', 'Deng, Xinzhou', 'Tu, Zhenbo', 'Li, Xinran', 'Xiao, Ruijing', 'Zhang, Qiuping']","['Huang X', 'Xiong M', 'Jin Y', 'Deng C', 'Xu H', 'An C', 'Hao L', 'Yang X', 'Deng X', 'Tu Z', 'Li X', 'Xiao R', 'Zhang Q']","['Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430071, P.R.

CD19- and GD2-CAR T-cell manufacturing records were reviewed to identify sources of variability. METHODS: CD19-CAR T cells were used to treat 43 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma and GD2-CAR T cells to treat eight patients with osteosarcoma and three with neuroblastoma. Both types of CAR T cells were manufactured using autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) concentrates and anti-CD3/CD28 beads for T-cell enrichment and simulation. RESULTS: A comparison of the first 6 GD2- and the first 22 CD19-CAR T-cell products manufactured revealed that GD2-CAR T-cell products contained fewer transduced cells than CD19-CAR T-cell products (147 +/- 102 x 10(6) vs 1502 +/- 1066 x 10(6); P = 0.0059), and their PBMC concentrates contained more monocytes (31.4 +/- 12.4% vs 18.5 +/- 13.7%; P = 0.019). Among the first 28 CD19-CAR T-cell products manufactured, four had poor expansion yielding less than 1 x 10(6) transduced T cells per kilogram. When PBMC concentrates from these four patients were compared with the 24 others, PBMC concentrates of poorly expanding products contained greater quantities of monocytes (39.8 +/- 12.9% vs. 15.3 +/- 10.8%, P = 0.0014). Among the patients whose CD19-CAR T cells expanded poorly, manufacturing for two patients was repeated using cryopreserved PBMC concentrates but incorporating a monocyte depleting plastic adherence step, and an adequate dose of CAR T cells was produced for both patients. CONCLUSIONS: Variability in CAR T-cell expansion is due, at least in part, to the contamination of the starting PBMC concentrates with monocytes.","['Stroncek, David F', 'Ren, Jiaqiang', 'Lee, Daniel W', 'Tran, Minh', 'Frodigh, Sue Ellen', 'Sabatino, Marianna', 'Khuu, Hanh', 'Merchant, Melinda S', 'Mackall, Crystal L']","['Stroncek DF', 'Ren J', 'Lee DW', 'Tran M', 'Frodigh SE', 'Sabatino M', 'Khuu H', 'Merchant MS', 'Mackall CL']","['Cell Processing Section, Department of Transfusion Medicine, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD, USA.

Criteria for initiating HCS evaluation are poorly defined, and results of genetic testing for hereditary hematologic malignancies have not been systematically reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 2014 to August 2015, 67 patients were referred to the Hereditary Hematologic Malignancy Clinic (HHMC). Referral reasons included (1) bone marrow failure or myelodysplastic syndrome in patients </= 50 years, (2) evaluation for germ-line inheritance of identified RUNX1, GATA2, or CEBPA mutations on targeted next-generation sequencing panels, and (3) strong personal and/or family history of malignancy. Cultured skin fibroblasts were utilized for germ-line DNA in all patients with hematologic malignancy. RESULTS: Eight patients (12%) were clinically diagnosed with a HCS: 4 patients with RUNX1-related familial platelet disorder (FPD)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 1 patient each with dyskeratosis congenita, Fanconi anemia, germ-line DDX41, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Two patients with concern for FPD/AML and LFS, respectively, had RUNX1 and TP53 variants of unknown significance. Additionally, 4 patients with prior HCS diagnosis (1 LFS, 3 FPD/AML) were referred for further evaluation and surveillance. CONCLUSION: In this HHMC-referred hematologic malignancy cohort, HCS was confirmed in 12 patients (18%). HCS identification provides insight for improved and individualized treatment, as well as screening/surveillance opportunities for family members. The HHMC has facilitated HCS diagnosis; with increased clinical awareness of hematologic malignancy predisposition syndromes, more patients who may benefit from evaluation can be identified. Mutation panels intended for prognostication may provide increased clinical suspicion for germ-line testing.","['DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Bannon, Sarah A', 'Routbort, Mark', 'Franklin, Anna', 'Mork, Maureen', 'Armanios, Mary', 'Mace, Emily M', 'Orange, Jordan S', 'Jeff-Eke, Meselle', 'Churpek, Jane E', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kornblau, Steve', 'Bertuch, Alison', 'Cheung, Hannah', 'Bhalla, Kapil', 'Futreal, Andrew', 'Godley, Lucy A', 'Patel, Keyur P']","['DiNardo CD', 'Bannon SA', 'Routbort M', 'Franklin A', 'Mork M', 'Armanios M', 'Mace EM', 'Orange JS', 'Jeff-Eke M', 'Churpek JE', 'Takahashi K', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kornblau S', 'Bertuch A', 'Cheung H', 'Bhalla K', 'Futreal A', 'Godley LA', 'Patel KP']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.
