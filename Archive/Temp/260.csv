TPA, which has been previously shown to induce B-CLL cells to mature towards plasmacytoid cells, results in the progressive expression of the enzymes tested in the cytoplasm of malignant cells, in particular AP and ANAE. Furthermore, the sensitivity to inhibitors and the pattern of reactivity of ANAE provide evidence for an enzyme subtype normally restricted to plasma cells. Thus, acid hydrolases--some of which showing plasma cell type of activity--are expressed during B-CLL cells differentiation induced in vitro.

To further investigate the nature and number of proteolytic cleavages involved in virus maturation, we quantitatively isolated the structural proteins of the Rauscher and Moloney strains of type C murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV and M-MuLV, respectively) by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Proteins and polypeptides isolated from R-MuLV included p10, p12, p15, p30, p15(E), gp69, and gp71 and three previously undescribed virus components designated here as p10', p2(E), and p2(E). Homologous proteins and polypeptides were isolated from M-MuLV. Complete or partial amino acid sequences of all the proteins listed above were either determined in this study or were available in previous reports from this laboratory. These data were compared with those from the translation of the M-MuLV proviral DNA sequence (Shinnick et al., Nature [London] 293:543-548, 1981) to determine the exact nature of proteolytic cleavages for all the structural proteins described above and to determine the origin of p10' and p2(E)s. The results showed that, during proteolytic processing of gp80env from M-MuLV (M-gp 80env), a single Arg residue was excised between gp70 and p15(E) and a single peptide bond was cleaved between p15(E) and p2(E). The structure of M-gPr80env is gp70-(Arg)-p15(E)-p2(E). The data suggest that proteolytic cleavage sites in R-gp85env are identical to corresponding cleavage sites in M-gp80env. The p2(E)s are shown to be different genetic variants of p2(E) present in the uncloned-virus preparations. The data for R- and M-p10's shows that they are cleavage products of the gag precursor with the structure p10-Thr-Leu-Asp-Asp-OH. The complete structure of Pr65gag is p15-p12-p30-p10'. Stoichiometries of the gag and env cleavage products in mature R- and M-MuLV were determined. In each virus, gag cleavage products (p15, p12, p30, and p10 plus p10') were found in equimolar amounts and p15(E)s were equimolar with p2(E)s. The stoichiometry of gag to env cleavage products was 4:1. These data are consistent with the proposal that proteolytic processing of precursor polyproteins occurs after virus assembly and that the C-terminal portion of Pr15(E) [i.e., p15(E)-p2(E)] is located on the inner side of the lipid bilayer of the virus.",['N01-CO-23909/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC254550,,,,,,,

There was a significant relationship between the abnormal karyotype and disease status, clinical stage, lymphocyte count, bone marrow infiltration pattern, monoclonal IgM gammopathy, and urinary monoclonal-free light chain status. Six of seven patients (87%) with trisomy 12 only had stage 0-11 disease, whereas all eight patients with trisomy 12 with other changes had stage III or IV disease (P less than .02). However, of nine patients with other karyotypic changes without trisomy 12, five had stage 0-II and four had stage III or IV disease. These observations suggest that trisomy 12 may be the primary or the earliest karyotypic change in a majority of aneuploid patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and that other karyotypic changes in addition to trisomy 12 may develop as a result of clonal evolution, dedifferentiation, or therapy. Of nine patients in whom autopsy studies were carried out, four were found to have diffuse histiocytic lymphoma or Richter's syndrome (three with trisomy 12 in combination with other chromosome changes and one with normal karyotype).

Methodology has been developed to reveal these hidden monoclonal bands and to show that they are related to the leukemia-associated membrane Ig (mIg). Of nine CLL cases with stainable mIgM and without discernable plasma Ig bands, marked hypogammaglobulinemia was evident in six. In the other three, a significant amount of protein was present in the gamma region. IgM was isolated from the plasma of these patients by affinity chromatography with Sepharose-4B, conjugated with affinity purified anti-human IgM antibodies. One to 3 mg were isolated from 20 to 40 ml of plasma. Agarose electrophoresis revealed a monoclonal Ig band in the isolated IgM in all cases. Eight of these IgM proteins were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Five were found to be pentameric IgM. In the remaining three, various amounts of monomeric IgM were detected. Attempts to make anti-idiotypic antibodies to the isolated proteins have been successful. Thus far, a rabbit anti-idiotypic antiserum was obtained in one case and two mouse monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies in two additional cases. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that plasma IgM and mIgM shared similar idiotypic determinants. One other monoclonal antibody was shown to be specific for a V region marker of a minor Ig population. These findings indicate that B leukemic lymphocytes do secrete a small amount of IgM and lend further support to the thesis that the maturation defect in CLL is incomplete. It is also feasible to isolate the secreted IgM and to produce anti-idiotypic antibodies to them. In view of the potential therapeutic effect of anti-idiotypic antibodies, this may offer an alternative and efficient approach to generate a large panel of anti-idiotypic antibodies for clinical trials. The possibility also exists that this approach is applicable to other B cell proliferative disorders such as the non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas.",['CA-34546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Three of the four patients were receiving consolidation or late intensification therapy for acute myoblastic leukemia (AML) in remission. The fourth was receiving induction therapy for de novo AML. During all or part of four chemotherapeutic cycles, serial Meg-CSA levels were assessed and correlated with the corresponding peripheral platelet counts. All courses of cytotoxic chemotherapy resulted in increases in serum Meg-CSA comparable to activity levels present in sera from patients with aplastic anemia. Two of the three patients studied during the early postchemotherapy interval manifested initial serum Meg-CSA elevations seven days before their thrombocytopenic nadirs when platelet counts were still between 100,000/mm3 and 140,000/mm3. Bone marrow recovery from chemotherapy was characterized by a decrease in serum Meg-CSA to pretherapy levels that occurred concurrently with the rise in platelet count to normal. These observations support the hypothesis that Meg-CSA is a physiologic humoral regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis elaborated in response to the depletion of either bone marrow megakaryocytes or megakaryocyte progenitor cells.","['HL 29277/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 31856/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

TMCs were either added directly to the DCs or were first stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (5 micrograms/mL) and grown in T cell growth factor (TCGF) prior to exposure to DCs. The presence of integrated HTLV proviral DNA in the transformed cells was determined by dot blot hybridization, utilizing a cloned probe to the HTLV-I genome. HTLV production by transformed TMCs was assessed for HTLV p19, reverse transcriptase, and virus particles. No transformation occurred with T cell donor lines that do not express HTLV. Low virus expressor DCs could only, with rare exception, transform preactivated TMCs. High-titer virus-producing DCs could transform activated and nonactivated cord blood cells and activated adult TMCs. Only MT-2 could routinely transform nonactivated normal adult and activated AIDS TMCs. HUT 102 B2 could transform only one activated AIDS sample, the cells of which initially expressed HTLV-like proteins and virions. Transformed cell lines contained subsets of mature T lymphocytes with variable HTLV expression. Prior activation and culture of the T lymphocytes increases the probability and rate of transformation by HTLV, allowing for biologic detection of low HTLV-producing cells and for in vitro expansion of T lymphocyte subsets from selected patients.",,,,,,,,,

All of the patients had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced B-derived CLL and were refractory to standard therapy, and more than 50% of their leukemia cells reacted with the T101 antibody in vitro. The patients received T101 antibody two times per week, over two to 50 hours by intravenous administration in 100 mL of normal saline containing 5% human albumin. Twelve patients were treated with a fixed dosage of 1, 10, 50, or 100 mg, and one patient was treated with 140 mg of antibody. It was demonstrated that patients given two-hour infusions of 50 mg developed pulmonary toxicity, with shortness of breath and chest tightness. This toxicity was eliminated when infusions of 50 or 100 mg of T101 were prolonged to 50 hours. All dose levels caused a rapid but transient decrease in circulating leukemia cell counts. In vivo binding to circulating and bone marrow leukemia cells was demonstrated at all dose levels with increased binding at higher dosages. Antimurine antibody responses were not demonstrated in any patients at any time during treatment. Circulating free murine antibody was demonstrated in the serum of only the two patients treated with 100 mg of antibody as a 50-hour infusion and the patient treated with 140 mg of antibody over 30 hours. Antigenic modulation was demonstrated in patients treated at all dose levels but was particularly apparent in patients treated with prolonged infusions of 50 and 100 mg of antibody. We were also able to demonstrate antigenic modulation in lymph node cells, which strongly suggests in vivo labeling of these cells. Overall, T101 antibody alone appears to have a very limited therapeutic value for patients with CLL.

Overall 4-year survival (48-53%) and failure-free survival (FFS) (37-40%) were similar in all groups except the 28 with T leukaemia and WCC greater than 100 X 10(9)1(-1) (20% and 13%). There was a significant advantage in FFS for patients randomised to receive low dose mediastinal radiation, and this was most marked in patients with T lymphoma (66% vs 18%, P = 0.006).",,PMC1976909,,,,,,,

Although the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for antibody diversity have now largely been elucidated, the structure of the T-cell receptor and the diversification of the receptor repertoire have only recently become amenable to study. One approach has involved immunochemical studies of the protein precipitated by monoclonal antibodies which react specifically with the immunizing T-cell clones. Another approach has been to clone and sequence a human or a murine T-cell specific message that may specify part of the T-cell receptor. We present here results of Southern blot analysis of non-T, immature T, and mature T-cell genomic DNA, and provide evidence that rearrangements of the YT35 sequences do occur in the DNA of thymic leukaemia T cells. This suggests that YT35 codes for at least part of the T-cell receptor and that rearrangements occur at this early stage of thymic ontogeny. Furthermore, DNA rearrangements are present in lymphocytes with phenotypic and functional characteristics of helper, killer, or suppressor T cells. We conclude that the three subpopulations of T cells operate via receptor molecules encoded by the same gene family.",['N01-AI-32505/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

By using (a) bromodeoxyuridine quenching of Hoechst 33342 fluorescence and (b) the drug ICRF-159, a selective G2 - M-blocking agent, we show that dAdo causes a G1 block in cultured T leukemic cells and that cells in the S phase exposed to dAdo are able to complete that S phase, pass through G2 + M, and return to the G1 phase. Centrifugal elutriation was used to enrich cells for various phases of the cell cycles. dAdo caused elevation of the dATP pool to a similar extent in G1, S, and G2 - M-enriched cell fractions, but did not cause a fall in the dCTP pool. These findings indicate that dAdo induces a G1 block via elevation of dATP pools, apparently independently of inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase.",,,,,,,,,

Exogenous 2',5'-An by itself can inhibit the transformation of human PBL by EBV. The present studies report that 2',5'-An and its cordycepin analog also augmented the tumoricidal activity of human NK cells. Incubation of nylon wool-passed PBL for 1 to 2 hr with the 5'-dephosphorylated core trimer of 2',5'-An boosted natural killing of tumor target cells modestly, but consistently. The cordycepin analog (3'-deoxyadenylate) also augmented NK activity. The optimal concentration both of 2',5'-A3 core and of 2',5'-3'dA3 core was 50 microM, and the optimal time for this effect was 2 hr of treatment. Kinetic analysis revealed that 2',5'-A3 core increased the lytic rate of NK cells by about one-third. This increase was due to an even greater increase (about 50%) in the lytic activity of individual NK cells, coupled with a slight decrease in the number of actual NK effector cells. In contrast, 3',5'-A3 core did not increase NK activity even at 300 microM, at which point it was toxic. In addition, to rule out a pro-drug effect as the basis for the boosting of NK activity by 2',5'-A3 core and by 2',5'-3'dA3 core, the effect of adenosine and cordycepin monomers on NK activity was tested. Neither adenosine nor cordycepin, tested at 150 microM (three times the optimal concentration of the trimer cores), boosted NK activity. The addition of 2'-deoxycoformycin (2 microM) had no effect on the actions of adenosine and cordycepin monomers. The data presented here demonstrate that 2',5'-A3 core and its analog 2',5'-3'dA3 core have another IFN-like action, augmentation of NK activity, in addition to inhibiting EBV-induced transformation.","['CA-12923/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23999/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'SO7 RR05417/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

The brief period (2 to 3 hr) required for stimulation suggests that expression of potentiated effector function(s) after stimulation requires no cell replication. The frequency of effector hybridoma cells capable of specific binding to target cells before and after stimulation is the same, as determined in a direct hybridoma-target cell conjugation test, although cytolytic activity is markedly enhanced. On the other hand, kinetic and cell dispersion assays indicate that the potentiation of cytolytic activity can be attributed to shortening of the lag period of killing as well as to a small enhancement in the recycling ability of cytolytic effectors. We suggest that shortening of the lag period involves activation of potential effectors, which is manifested at a post-binding stage of effector-target interaction.

A significant level of tumor-specific cytotoxicity was detected in the spleen cells of adult hyperimmune mice by the 51Cr-release assay after in vitro sensitization with mitomycin C-treated L1210 cells. This was mediated by cytotoxic T cells, since in vivo administration of antithymocyte serum or in vitro treatment of the spleen cells with anti-Thy 1.2 antibody and complement abrogated the cytotoxicity completely.

Further purification of IL-1 by high-resolution gel filtration- and anion exchange-high performance liquid chromatography revealed that fibroblast proliferation activity could not be separated from IL-1 activity (thymocyte proliferation), suggesting that both activities are the properties of a single molecule.

The immunosuppressive activity of CsA is at least in part due to inhibition of lymphokine production by activated T lymphocytes. Specifically, inhibition of T-cell growth factor (TCGF; also designated interleukin 2) production appears to be an important pathway by which CsA impairs T-cell function. To define further both the specificity of CsA and the level at which it interferes with lymphokine gene expression, we have studied its effects on TCGF mRNA accumulation as well as TCGF gene transcription. These studies were performed with a cloned human leukemic T-cell line (Jurkat, subclone 32), which can be induced with phytohemagglutinin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to produce large amounts of TCGF. In these cells, high levels of TCGF mRNA were present in induced but not in uninduced Jurkat cells as judged by hybridization to a cloned human TCGF cDNA probe. CsA completely inhibited induced TCGF mRNA accumulation at concentrations of 0.3-1.0 microgram/ml, whereas low levels of appropriately sized TCGF mRNA were present at 0.01 microgram/ml. In nuclear transcription experiments, CsA inhibited the synthesis of TCGF transcripts in a dose-dependent manner with complete inhibition at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml. In contrast, CsA did not inhibit the expression of two other inducible genes, TCGF receptor and HT-3. Further, HLA gene expression was also less affected than TCGF in CsA-treated cells. These data suggest a relatively selective action of CsA on TCGF gene transcription.",,PMC391668,,,,,,,

By dividing LI by ts the fractional birth rate (FBR) was derived representing the percentage of the total leukemic cell mass newly formed per unit of time. The present study confirms a previous investigation in which a higher LI was detected in association with hyperdiploidy. It shows that ts is simultaneously prolonged, while the DNA synthesis rate remains unchanged. This proves that in hyperdiploid cases the longer ts is caused by a larger amount of DNA to be synthesized. The FBR is the same for eu- and hyperdiploid, as well as for CALL and T-ALL cases, and there is no correlation between the FBR and the white blood cell count. So far, ALL is the only type of leukemia in which a prolongation of ts has been demonstrated in comparison to normal human lymphatic cells. This prolongation is not caused primarily by differences in ploidy. The type of growth is accumulative, since the relative rate of cell production is lower than normal. As a finding of practical importance, the labeling index is shown to correlate quite closely with the FBR. In this cell system the LI can thus be used as a parameter reflecting the rate of relative cell production.",,,,,,,,,

Following absorption with B cell and ""null"" cell lines, 513 exhibited prominent reactivity with a membrane antigen that was present on normal thymocytes and lymphoblasts from 11 of 13 patients with T cell ALL and 1 of 16 patients with common ALL, but was not detected on normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, normal bone marrow cells and leukemic lymphoblasts with an undifferentiated phenotype. SDS-PAGE analysis of this antigen indicated that it was composed of two subunits, 43-kDa and 12-kDa. Sequential absorption experiments revealed that: (1) the 12-kDa subunit was antigenically similar to beta 2 microglobulin; (2) the intact molecule did not exhibit HLA-A, B or C ""framework"" determinants; (3) the molecule was antigenically distinct from a human thymus-leukemia antigen HTA-1 (recognized by monoclonal antibodies NA1/34 and OKT6); and (4) the molecule was antigenically distinct from adenosine deaminase. It is concluded that 513 reacts with a membrane protein (designated 513TL) which exhibits properties characteristic of a histocompatibility-like antigen whose expression is restricted to thymocytes and some leukemias (TL antigen). Its antigenic distinction from another recently characterized human TL antigen, HTA-1, suggests polymorphism among this family of alloantigens.",['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

For maximal activation, an important adjunct to the Con A is the phorbol ester TPA. In the presence of TPA, IL 2 production by thymocytes is relatively independent of adherent accessory cells; this allows us to compare the abilities of different thymic subpopulations to make IL 2. The most numerous class that includes IL 2 producers is made up of cells with a typical ""medullary"" population, the phenotype: moderately small, postmitotic cells that fail to bind peanut agglutinin. In addition, however, a population of large, proliferating lymphoblasts is competent in IL 2 production directly as isolated. Relative to the total ""medullary"" population, the lymphoblasts are enriched for the ability to make IL 2. They account for a significant proportion of the total IL 2 produced by thymocytes, and demonstrate that this aspect of immunocompetence is not restricted to cells that have finished their intrathymic proliferation. The IL 2-producing lymphoblasts do not bind peanut agglutinin or express thymus-leukemia antigen, but they do express high levels of Lyt-1. Although distinct from most medullary thymocytes, therefore, they are also distinct from the majority of cortical blast cells for which a direct precursor role has been established. They may be a subset of the rare proliferating blast cells in the medulla. Further heterogeneity in the thymic IL 2 producers is demonstrated by their expression of the Lyt-2 glycoprotein. The majority of IL 2 producers are Lyt-2- as are the majority of peripheral T ""helper"" cells. However, a distinct minority of the thymic IL 2 producers express Lyt-2. Therefore, the ability of some peripheral Lyt-2+ cells to secrete IL 2 may be determined at the time of their initial programming in the thymus.","['AI 16769/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 19752/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 14195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

In comparative growth rate experiments the T cells were 2.3-fold and 400-fold more sensitive to growth inhibition by deoxyguanosine and arabinosylguanine, respectively, than were the B cells. Only the T cells, but not the B cells, could phosphorylate in situ deoxyguanosine or arabinosylguanine to the corresponding triphosphate. Both the phosphorylation and cytotoxicity of arabinosylguanine in the T cell line could be prevented by deoxycytidine, which suggests that deoxycytidine-deoxyguanosine kinase initiated the intracellular metabolism and cytotoxicity of this nucleoside analogue.

In concordance with this fact, soluble NADPH dependent O2- forming enzyme(s) were activated several fold by PMA. PMA also induced DNA strand breaks, a process markedly inhibited by TMU. As expected, ADP-ribosyl transferase (ADPRT), which is well known to require DNA strand breaks for its enzymatic activity, was activated by PMA treatment. In addition, specific inhibitors for ADPRT, namely 3-amino-benzamide and nicotinamide, inhibited PMA-induced LT production. Taken together, these three successive events, activation of soluble NADPH dependent O2- forming enzyme(s), DNA strand breaks and activation of ADPRT, may be required for PMA-induced LT production by AC5-8.",,,,,,,,,

Anti-Leu 10 reacts with HLA-DC molecules on homozygous B cell lines expressing HLA-DR 1,2,4,5,6,8, and 9. It reacts with heterozygous B lymphocytes expressing DR7 and DRw10, suggesting it also recognizes HLA-DC molecules linked to DRw10. The HLA-DC molecules detected by anti-Leu 10 are expressed on all Ig-positive and DR-positive peripheral B lymphocytes and an apparent subpopulation of DR-positive peripheral blood monocytes. Two-color immunofluorescence experiments using phycoerythrin-anti-HLA-DR (L243) and FITC-anti-Leu 10 demonstrated a correlation of the amounts of HLA-DR and DC antigens expressed on B lymphocytes. Cells expressing relatively low, or high amounts of one Class II molecule express respectively low or high amounts of the other Class II molecule. Anti-Leu 10 reacted with all B lymphocyte derived tumor cell lines not with lines of myeloid or erythroid origin, and with only one T cell derived line, HUT-78 which has an activated T cell phenotype. Consistent with this result, anti-Leu 10 binding suggested the presence of HLA-DC on activated T cells in lymphoid tissue, in addition to staining B cells. HLA-DC was also detected on mitogen and MLC activated T cells by anti-Leu 10 binding. Anti-Leu 10 is, therefore, a useful reagent for further studies of the role of HLA-DC in T cell activation and in normal B cell and monocyte functions.","['CA 29989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30369/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

A large proportion of AML blasts showing minimal or no differentiation (AML-M1) were intensely labeled by AGF43 in contrast to a smaller percentage of blasts showing partial differentiation (AML-M2 and acute myelomonocytic leukemia). The AGF43 antigen is expressed by bone marrow lymphoid (TdT+) and myeloid (CFU-GM) progenitor cells, 95% of B cells and 65% of T cells in the blood and absent from monocytes. Only 17% of normal myeloblasts were weakly stained by AGF43. Sections of tonsil and spleen were used to confirm that, unlike antibodies to MHC class II antigens, AGF43 stained a majority of T cells and macrophages were unreactive. In conclusion, the MAb AGF43 identifies a new precursor cell antigen. The distribution of this antigen during normal myelopoiesis and on AML cells support the suggestion that acute myeloid leukemias originate in pluripotent or closely related myeloid stem cells.",,,,,,,,,

The cell line designated Be13 is killed readily within 24 hr by 10(-9) M dexamethasone. No lysis is induced by nonglucocorticoid steroids. The lysis is mediated via specific cytoplasmic receptors and is efficiently blocked by the antagonist cortexolone. The inhibiting effect of actinomycin D and cycloheximide on the lytic process suggests the involvement of gene activation and destruction of the cells by an ""autolytic protein."" Kinetic studies imply that the lytic process is induced during a distinct phase of the cell cycle. Dexamethasone, however, does not cause an arrest in a distinct phase of the cell cycle. The Be13 cell is a unique human cell line killed directly by glucocorticoids, and it may serve as a suitable in vitro model for studying the lytic effect of glucocorticoids on the proliferating compartment of human leukemias.",,,,,,,,,

Antisera were obtained following immunization of New Zealand White rabbits with [3H]triamcinolone acetonide [( 3H]TA)-glucocorticoid receptor complexes partially purified by two-stage DNA-cellulose chromatography. The presence of anti-human glucocorticoid receptor antibodies was verified by: (a) adsorption of [3H]TA-receptor-antibody complexes to Protein A; (b) a shift to higher apparent molecular weight in the elution position from Sephacryl S300 of [3H]TA-receptor complexes incubated with immune serum; and (c) the ability of immune serum to displace [3H]TA-receptor complexes on sucrose gradients. These antibodies also recognized rat liver and murine S49 cell glucocorticoid receptors. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [3H]DM-labeled IM-9 cytosol identified a major competable band with a molecular weight of approximately 90,000, three minor competable components with molecular weights of approximately 78,000, approximately 51,000, and approximately 38,500, and at least 21 other noncompetable components. Following immunoprecipitation of [3H]DM-labeled cytosol with immune serum, only the Mr 90,000 and 78,000 components were seen. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [3H]DM-labeled CEM-C7 cytosol revealed a larger number of [3H]DM-labeled components. However, after immunoprecipitation of [3H]DM-labeled CEM-C7 cytosol, a predominant competable component with a molecular weight of 90,000 was easily identified. This component was markedly diminished when cytosols from the glucocorticoid receptor-deficient cell line ICR-27 were used. Thus, the combination of affinity labeling and anti-human glucocorticoid receptor antibodies is capable of providing direct physical identification of human lymphoid glucocorticoid receptors.",['CA 32226/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Whole cells specifically took up [3H]-1,25-(OH)2D3 with high affinity (Kd 3.6 X 10(-11) M) and low capacity. Subcellular fractionation of labeled cells showed that binding was restricted to cytosols and nuclei. Sucrose gradient centrifugation of cells preincubated with [3H]-1,25-(OH)2D3 revealed a single 3.6S peak which was totally displaced with 100-fold excess nonradioactive hormone. However, we were unable to demonstrate specific binding of 1,25-(OH)2D3 by postlabeling standard cytosol preparations. In addition, cytosols prepared from a mixture of CML cells and 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor-positive T47D (human breast cancer) cells had less than 10% of the binding measured in T47D cytosol alone. However, the levels of binding in T47D cytosols were not reduced if the receptors were occupied with [3H]-1,25-(OH)2D3 prior to the addition of the CML cytosols. Thus, CML cells appear to contain both the receptor for 1,25-(OH)2D3 and an unknown substance which prevents its detection following the preparation of cytosol. Cells from patients with CML in the chronic phase specifically bound more 1,25-(OH)2D3 [18.0 +/- 3.2 (S.E.) fmol/10(7) cells] than did those in acute myeloid transformation [7.2 +/- 1.5] or than did cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia [2.6 +/- 0.8]. Only cells from the first group of patients responded to the addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3 by differentiating along the monocyte-macrophage pathway. We conclude that the differentiation-induction effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 is likely to depend on adequate levels of receptor and that intact cells rather than cytosol preparations should be studied before cells of a particular tissue are designated as receptor negative.",,,,,,,,,

These two activities coeluted upon chromatography of fetal bovine serum on a Sephadex G-150 column. A partially purified fraction from pokeweed mitogen-stimulated human leukocyte-conditioned medium which effectively induced ML-1 cell differentiation also prevented the down modulation of PDB receptors. As indicated by Scatchard analysis, prevention of down modulation was due to stabilization of the number of binding sites rather than to a change in receptor affinity.

These variants can grow in up to 320 nM TPA concentrations and do not differentiate into morphologically or functionally mature macrophages. The number of phorbol ester receptors, their affinity for phorbol dibutyrate, and the regulation of receptors are the same as for wild-type HL60 cells.

The B lymphocytes of the cell line are polyclonal and contain Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA. Many of the T lymphocytes, a few of the B lymphocytes, and none of the eosinophils express HTLV p19 and p24 antigens. By 6 months of culture, the ME line no longer contained eosinophils. A variant line of ME was established; this variant (ME-2) is notable because the cells (greater than 80%) adhere tightly to the bottom of the culture flask; they do not express T lymphocyte markers, but 30% of the cells contain cytoplasmic mu heavy immunoglobulin chains.

Electron microscopic examinations determined the distribution of C-type virus particles in tissues, and the phenotypic-mixing test served as a biological assay for exogenous LLV. The IF gsa was found in all organs tested, and fluorescence was usually found where virus particles were concentrated. In the oviduct and intestine, IF gsa was frequently at the border of the lumina and in the connective tissue associated with basal membranes of glands. In skin, the antigen was detected in smooth muscle, in feather pulp, and in basal epidermal cells of developing feathers. Results of various tests on Ottawa strains of chickens were usually in agreement. For example, among hens that shed gsa into egg albumen, only the viremic hens were consistently positive for IF gsa in both spleens and oviducts. Geometric mean CF titers of antigen were respectively five- and 23-fold higher in spleens and oviducts from viremic hens than in those from nonviremic hens. These findings suggest that the gsa was associated with exogenous virus infection. In Cornell S strain hens that had not been exposed to LLV, gsa was detected in splenic tissue by CF and ELISA but not by the IF test. This gsa was presumed to be of endogenous origin.",,,,,,,,,

Treatment of virus-producing cells with tunicamycin totally inhibited the glycosylation of PrEnv, and resulted in the formation of a nonglycosylated form of the protein of molecular weight 62 kDa. This component was not proteolytically processed inside the cells, and neither it nor any derivative proteins were incorporated into extracellular virions. Treatment of cells with 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNM), which inhibits the cellular glucosidases normally involved in removal of the three glucose residues present on the initially transferred oligosaccharide chains, resulted in the intracellular accumulation of a slightly larger than normal form of PrENV, and decreased levels of cell-associated gp70. Only gp70 was detected on the cell surface. The bulk of the gp70 produced in the presence of the drug was aberrantly glycosylated, and contained decreased levels of complex and increased numbers of high mannose oligosaccharides; almost all of the gp70 molecules however, contained at least one complex sugar chain. Decreased incorporation of both env and gag proteins into extracellular virions was observed, despite the fact that the gag proteins were processed normally intracellularly; in contrast, DNM treatment of Gazdar murine sarcoma virus-infected HTG2 cells, which produce only gag but not env proteins, did not inhibit the release of extracellular virus. Ultrastructural examination of FrMCF-infected cells treated with DNM indicated the presence of large numbers of intracytoplasmic vacuoles, many of which contained viral particles. These studies indicate that the normal maturation process involved in the formation of complex oligosaccharides is necessary to obtain efficient transport to the plasma membrane and proteolysis of PrEnv, and also provide evidence suggesting a role for the env proteins in regulating assembly of gag proteins into virions.",['CA 16599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

We previously tested a large number of isolates of mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs), and reported that all of them share a distinct receptor on NIH/3T3 cells (A. Rein, Virology 120, 251, 1982). We now extend this generalization to several additional recombinant isolates, including two (SL3-2 and GPA-V2) which would not be considered MCFs on the basis of host-range data. We note the superiority of interference tests, based on positive, unambiguous data, over host-range tests for virus classification. We also show that in contrast to the MCFs, which are all derived from ecotropic MuLVs, a recombinant derived from wild mouse amphotropic MuLV (S. Rasheed et al., Int. J. Cancer 29, 345, 1982) uses a unique receptor on NIH/3T3 cells. This suggests that (a) mouse cells contain more than one type of endogenous env sequence; and (b) there is some specificity in the generation of recombinants, since ecotropic MuLVs appear to give rise only to MCFs, while amphotropic MuLV has generated a distinct type of recombinant. It also represents a second case (in addition to the MCFs) in which an env gene recombinant is more pathogenic than its exogenous parent. We also show that xenotropic MuLV does not interfere with MCFs in NZB mouse cells; thus, despite the close homology between MCF and xenotropic env sequences, the gp70 of xenotropic MuLV appears to have no detectable affinity for the MCF receptor.",['N01-C0-23909/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

The procedure involves the use of a 220-base-pair (bp) EcoRI fragment bearing the SuIII+ suppressor tRNA gene as an insertional mutagen. The plasmid DNA to be mutagenized is linearized by a variety of means, and the suppressor fragment is ligated into the site of cleavage. Successful insertion mutants can be readily detected in Escherichia coli carrying lac- amber mutations on MacConkey lactose plates; virtually 100% of the red colonies contain insertions of the fragment. Subsequent removal of the SuIII+ gene and recyclization leaves a 12-bp insertion if the original cleavage was blunt-ended and a 9-bp insertion if the original cleavage generated 3-bp cohesive termini. This technique, as well as conventional linker mutagenesis with decamer and dodecamer linkers, was used to generate a large library of insertion mutations in cloned DNA copies of the genome of Moloney murine leukemia virus. A number of viable mutants were isolated bearing 9-, 10-, and 12-bp insertions in various domains of the genome. The map positions of the viable mutations suggest that the viral long terminal repeats and portions of the gag and env genes are quite insensitive to alteration. Although most of the mutations were stable for many passages, some of the mutants lost the inserted DNA; we presume that the insertion was somewhat deleterious in these mutants and that continued passage of the virus selected for overgrowth by a revertant.",['1 RO1 CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC345386,,,,,,,

We find that recombinant human IFN-gamma induces expression of HLA-D antigens on human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) and enhances expression of HLA-D antigens on normal human monocytes and macrophages. Induction of both HLA-D antigen expression and HLA-D mRNA accumulation occurs within 1 day of exposure of HL-60 to IFN-gamma and is maximal by day 5. Maximal antigen expression occurs in the presence of 100-500 units of IFN-gamma per ml. IFN-gamma induces expression of DR but not DC antigens on HL-60, as confirmed by using four different murine monoclonal antibodies or one rabbit heterologous antibody. RNA blot data show that IFN-gamma-exposed HL-60 cells contain mRNA for DR alpha and DR beta polypeptides but not for DC alpha and DC beta polypeptides, which also suggests that HLA-DR and HLA-DC gene regions can be independently regulated. IFN-gamma induces 20% of HL-60 cells to differentiate to macrophage-like cells. However, IFN-gamma dose-response studies using both HL-60 cells and a nondifferentiation variant of HL-60 cells (HL-60 blast) clearly show that induction of transcription and expression of HLA-D gene products by IFN-gamma can be uncoupled from expression of other monocyte-macrophage characteristics.

NK cells, suppressor T-cells, cytotoxic K-cells, memory T-cells, and humoral immune responses usually subdue the virus into latency. Individuals with immune deficiency are at great risk of developing immunoregulatory disturbances and lymphoproliferative diseases when confronted by EBV. The infection of B-cells by EBV provokes a marked activation of immunoregulatory T-cells and requires restoration of immune homeostasis during convalescence. This is accomplished with difficulty in an individual with significant immune defects. The X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome is an exemplary model for studying EBV in immune deficient individuals. Boys with XLP can develop acquired agammaglobulinemia, aplastic anemia, chronic or fatal IM, and a variety of B-cell malignant lymphomas following infection by the virus. We have identified multiple immune defects in the patients and progressive immunoregulatory disturbances following infection by the virus. Other patients with immune deficiency syndromes, i.e., ataxia telangiectasia or the renal transplant recipient, are also at increased risk for developing EBV-induced lymphoproliferative diseases. Moreover, certain families are at increased risk for EBV-associated malignancies, especially those with a triad of manifestations (i.e., autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, and lymphoma). Chromosomal breakage as seen in patients with ataxia telangiectasia may predispose to leukemogenesis. Immunoregulatory defects are also probably predisposing factors to lymphomagenesis. Both inherited and acquired defects can render persons vulnerable to leukemia and lymphoma.",['CA 3O196-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

The c-myc gene was found to be rearranged in two lymphomas, an African Burkitt's lymphoma and a non-Hodgkins lymphoma in leukemic phase. The Burkitt's rearrangement involved the insertion of new DNA sequences upstream from the c-myc 5' coding region, presumably replacing the normal c-myc transcriptional promoter. None of the other 104 patients, including 20 with elevated myc expression, exhibited any evidence of a genetic rearrangement involving the c-myc gene. Our results show that there is a subset of hematopoietic malignancies characterized by elevated expression of c-myc.

EPR studies of aqueous solutions containing the spin trap phenyl-tert-butylnitrone and various platinum(IV) complexes revealed that the compounds are incapable of producing radical species which may in turn cause DNA breakage.

It was not precipitable by normal sera or anti-env antibodies. Like the gag-associated fusion proteins of some acute leukemia viruses, p36 was found to be phosphorylated in vivo, although it lacked detectable ATP-specific protein kinase activity in vitro. By kinetics during pulse-chase labeling experiments and by comparison of two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps, this protein is not an intermediate in gag precursor processing. One lymphoma cell line is described that resembles a nonproducer RadLV-transformant, synthesizing relatively large amounts of p36 in the absence of Pr66gag or p30 production. Several RadLV-induced lymphoma cell lines also produce p36, while it was not detectable in the radiation-induced lines tested. In addition, p36 was not produced by mouse or mink fibroblasts or cultured thymocyte cell lines infected with virus passaged from the RadLV-induced lymphomas.

This specific kind of disease is endemic to certain areas of Japan and the Caribbean, and several isolated cases have been described also in the United States, Israel, South America, and Africa. The disease is probably also endemic to Africa and South America, but sufficient studies of these areas have not been performed. We have molecularly cloned the HTLV genome and used the viral DNA as a probe in a large molecular study of the DNAs of human hematopoietic malignancies. The results showed that HTLV sequences could be detected in the fresh leukemic cells of all cases of ATLL tested. The neoplastic cells are of clonal origin and contain one or few copies of integrated HTLV. Detailed comparative analyses by restriction enzyme mapping of the proviral DNA in U.S., Japanese, Caribbean, and Israeli cases revealed that the viruses are almost indistinguishable. The DNA from neoplastic cells of other cases of hematopoietic neoplasias analyzed were negative for HTLV sequences with the exception of two. DNA from cells of a patient (MO) with a T-cell variant of hairy cell leukemia did contain a provirus only distantly related to HTLV (less than 10% of DNA sequence homology). The virus isolated from the MO cells has been designated HTLV-II. The second case was a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia whose cells contained exogenous DNA sequences distantly related to HTLV. Different fragments of the clones HTLV genome have been used to hybridize to DNA from uninfected normal tissues of several vertebrate species, including humans, in a search for cell-derived sequences related to the HTLV genome. No homologous sequences were found except sequences distantly related to the pol and env genes, indicating that HTLV does not carry a cellularly derived onc gene. Surprisingly, however, infection of normal human fresh T cells by HTLV transforms them into cells with permanent growth and with several other properties similar to neoplastic T cells. We have also studied the expression of viral and cellular genes in fresh and cultured neoplastic cells from patients with ATLL. Several species of viral mRNAs are always detected in the cultured neoplastic cells, whereas in some fresh samples expression of normal mRNA was not detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether cultured acute lymphocytic leukemic T cell lines can be induced to differentiate and express the Tac antigen, a cell surface protein that contains a TCGF-binding site, after exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and/or phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Reactivity of anti-Tac with induced leukemic T cells was studied by three techniques, including: 1) flow microfluorometry; 2) specific binding of [3H]anti-Tac; and 3) receptor immunoprecipitation with anti-Tac and analysis by SDS-PAGE. After exposure to PMA with or without PHA, both JURKAT and HSB-2 acute lymphocytic leukemic T cells displayed Tac antigen within 6 to 8 hr. Induction of receptor expression was blocked by actinomycin D, suggesting a requirement for new mRNA transcription. Induced JURKAT cells contained approximately 7000 Tac molecules per cell, and the binding of anti-Tac to these cells was blocked in a dose-related manner by purified TCGF but not by insulin or purified recombinant interferon-alpha. SDS-PAGE analysis of anti-Tac immunoprecipitates demonstrated that receptors present on induced JURKAT cells were 2000 to 3000 daltons smaller than those present on PHA-activated normal lymphoblasts or induced HSB-2 cells. Induction of JURKAT cells with both PHA and PMA resulted in marked secretion of TCGF as well as the appearance of Tac antigen. After activation of these cells with PMA alone, Tac antigen was similarly expressed, but the level of TCGF synthesis was less than 1% of that obtained after dual induction with PHA and PMA. These data indicate that the signals required for TCGF synthesis and Tac expression are not identical, and furthermore that induction of Tac antigen and TCGF is not obligately linked in these cells.",,,,,,,,,

Since only a portion of the cells in culture expressed Ig light chains, experiments were carried out to exclude the possibility that the cultures were not a mixture of B and T or non-B cells. Cells that expressed kappa- or lambda-light chains were separated by cell sorting from kappa- or lambda-negative cells and replaced in culture. Light chain negative cells reexpressed light chains after time in culture. After 5-azacytidine treatment of the cell lines, all cells expressed Ig light chains.

Tumor-promoting phorbol diesters, but not the inactive parent alcohol, stimulated Na+-dependent H+ efflux in a rapid (within 1 min at 37 degrees C) and reversible manner. Stimulation was dependent on the concentration of extracellular sodium; lithium could substitute for sodium, but choline could not. Stimulation was dependent on the activity of extracellular protons and was inhibited completely by amiloride. The concentrations of phorbol diesters at which we observed half-maximal stimulation of Na+-dependent H+ efflux are very similar to the Kd reported in the literature for binding of these phorbol diesters to the phorbol ester receptor and the Km for phorbol diester activation of protein kinase C.

EBV-receptors were found on subpopulations of leukemic cells from each of 7 patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) tested. MA was present on low numbers (1-5 per cent) of fresh leukemic cells of 7 patients and in some instances occurred with a greater frequency after 3 to 5 days in culture, with or without 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. In 11 fresh leukemic cell preparations from 8 HCL patients, no EBNA was demonstrated. However, 2 samples after 4 days in culture expressed low frequencies of EBNA-positive cells. Spontaneous, EBV-positive cell lines were established with a high transformation efficiency from 3 HCL blood samples but not from 8 other specimens. Infectious EBV could be rescued from some hairy leukemic cell preparations by co-cultivation with cord blood lymphocytes. These results demonstrated that leukemic cell populations harbored infectious EBV, that the leukemic cells expressed virus receptors and suggested that a small subpopulation of leukemic cells might become infected in vivo at least transiently and possibly transformed in vitro by EBV. To test for the extent of occult in vivo infection of leukemic cells with EBV, Southern type hybridization studies were performed with a probe for EBV genome (Bam HI W). At a sensitivity level of 0.1 genome per cell, EBV genome was not detected in the leukemic cell populations of 7 patients. We conclude that host defence mechanisms protecting these individuals from EBV also prevent infections of the leukemic cell and/or most hairy leukemic cells are not suitable targets for both infection and transformation.","['2507 RR05712/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25873/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

This virus, named HTLV-I, is strongly associated with a malignant leukemia-lymphoma of mature T-cells. This disease was first clinically characterized in Japan but subsequently found to cluster in the Caribbean region, areas of the U.S. and in other countries. This retrovirus-associated malignancy has an adult onset and usually a rapidly fatal course. Lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, cutaneous infiltration and hypercalcemia are found. HTLV-I has been characterized in detail and shown to be an exogenous retrovirus. HTLV-I infection is detected in normal populations and is endemic in restricted areas of Japan, the Caribbean, South America, and the U.S. Cases of ATL tend to cluster in these areas. Future studies will focus on learning (1) how HTLV-I is transmitted from individual to individual; (2) the nature of the mechanism by which HTLV-I transforms T-cells; (3) whether we can use probes from HTLV-I to detect other (related) retroviruses in other human neoplasms.",,,,71,,,,,

Tissue-specific expression of endogenous feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-related genes was detected in cellular subpopulations of the cat placenta by in situ method of hybridization. Gel blotting analysis of placental poly(A)-selected RNA revealed that the FeLV-related RNA species were primarily subgenomic, representing the env gene region of the endogenous provirus elements. Like the endogenous retrovirus genes, c-myb and c-myc loci of the cat genomic DNA were also transcribed at differential levels in normal tissues of the cat. Dot-blot hybridization analysis showed that the expression of these two oncogenes was linked to growth and development as it varied with the gestational age of the fetus and from fetal to adult tissues. Among the major hematopoietic organs, spleen and bone marrow contained both c-myb and c-myc transcripts, while thymus preferentially expressed the c-myb gene. In contrast to the low level of c-myc expression in fetal thymus tissues, enhanced c-myc expression was detected in all five thymomas tested and also in several other neoplasms including two granulocytic leukemias. The feline c-myb gene was not very active in granulocytic leukemias or in three of the five thymomas.

The major need in NHL is to better define those patients who might benefit by autologous BMT and to reduce the relapse rate by improved pre- or post-transplant therapy. Similar results to those in NHL could be obtained in acute leukemia if occult tumor cells could be eliminated from autologous marrow. Animal model experiments have shown that it is feasible to eliminate low level contamination with tumor cells by in vitro immunologic or pharmacologic treatment. While it is too early to accurately assess the efficacy of ongoing clinical trials using those marrow purging techniques, a few patients have exhibited encouraging durations of CCR. Should these approaches prove to be effective in only a fraction of cases, combination in vitro treatment or the use of more efficient effector mechanisms for cell killing (e.g., ricin conjugated antibody) may very well clear occult tumor from the marrow of most patients. The encouraging results with autologous BMT in leukemia and lymphoma stand in sharp contrast to the disappointing results so far achieved with the non-hematologic solid tumors. It is, however, possible that those cancers have not been subjected to the most rigorous test for successful autologous BMT and that the search for newer agents which can produce operationally irreversible aplasia may provide a fairer test of this approach. It is to be hoped that future research will settle this point.",,,,71,,,,,

Therefore, they serve as an important model system with which to examine critical biochemical aspects of this developmental process.

The adrenergic agonists, isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, exhibited activation constants (Kact) of 0.1, 0.5, and 20 mumol/L, respectively. Thus, the beta-receptor-cyclase complex of Rauscher cells is apparently one of the most sensitive of all erythroid cells reported thus far. The epinephrine-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response was inhibited by propranolol, alprenolol, and hydroxybenzylpindolol, with inhibition constants (KI) of 3.8, 2.2, and 0.1 nmol/L, respectively. Using [125I]-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol as ligand, uninduced Rauscher cells were shown to possess 1,100 receptors/cell, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 400 pmol/L. Erythropoietin, but not dimethylsulfoxide, induction caused a specific increase in receptor density to 3,300/cell on differentiating Rauscher cells. This is the first demonstration of membrane receptor regulation by erythropoietin that may be important in the complex interplay of hormonal effects during erythropoiesis.","['AM 01349/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 34041/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Based on the toxicity observed in 5 patients with advanced breast cancer, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 12 X 10(6) unit/day for 1 month. In phase II study, HLBI was administered by i.m. injection at a dose of 3-6 X 10(6) unit/day. Out of 391 patients entered into this study, 280 patients were evaluable. Complete and partial responses were observed in 40 (14.3%) out of 280 evaluable patients, including 11 (19.6%) out of 56 renal cell cancers, 14 (19.2%) out of 73 multiple myelomas, and 9 (17.3%) out of 52 malignant lymphomas among others. Major side effects were fever (69.8%), gastrointestinal disturbances (31.4%), leukopenia (30.7%), thrombocytopenia (27.8%), hepatotoxicities (23.6%) and general fatigue (22.1%).",,,,,,,,,

Recently we have identified and purified the integrated and proviral DNA sequences specific for two rat endogenous helper leukemia viruses, WR- RaLV , originated from a chemically induced wild rat fibrosarcoma, and RHHV , isolated from a chemically induced rat hepatoma, HTC-H1 (1). By using a multidisciplinary approach combining restriction endonuclease analysis, reverse phase V-column chromatography, agarose gel electrophoresis, Southern blot transfer and filter nucleic acid hybridization, we were able to demonstrate that the rat helper leukemia viral DNA sequence was approximately 8.4-8.8 kb. The 8.8 kb RHHV DNA was molecularly cloned via the EK-1 certified vector pBR 322 plasmid into E. coli RRI cells. A successful recombinant clone, 8/32, that carried one entire RHHV 8.8 kb DNA sequence was mapped by restriction endonuclease analyses. Restricted DNA fragments of various sizes throughout the complete RHHV genome were isolated and purified for intranuclear microinjection into normal rat kidney cells. Release of type C infectious helper virus in these microinjected cells was investigated by superinfection on K-NRK, Kirsten sarcoma transformed non-producer cells. Recombination of the helper viral DNA sequence, en toto or of subgenomic sizes, carried in microinjected cells, with the sarcomagenic DNA sequence, carried in K-NRK cells, was also studied by genome-rescue and cell-transformation experiments. Our observations led to the conclusion that all critical genetic elements including the 5' LTR helper DNA sequence, gag, pol, and env genes, encoded for the biological activity of the type C helper virus resided within the 6.0 kb proximal to the 5' terminus of the endogenous rat type C helper virus DNA. They proved vitally essential for the recombination with the Src sequence during the evolution of an infectious, transforming and replication-competent retrovirus.",,,,,,,,,

The thymus of treated animals remains devoid of detectable ICC throughout the 4-month period of testing. This pattern of ICC suppression occurs independently of virus neutralization as shown by the inability of F(ab')2 preparations, which retained neutralizing activity, to prevent early establishment of ICC. Immune IgG significantly decreases, but does not eliminate gp71 expression in all tissues tested. In control animals, ICC reside within a minor subpopulation of cortical, thymic T cells, whereas peripheral (i.e., splenic) ICC are totally devoid of conventional T cell, B cell, and macrophage phenotypic markers.

The results of this study indicate that the translocated c-myc oncogene is transcribed in plasma cells but is repressed in lymphoblastoid cells. Thus, the factors necessary for translocated c-myc transcription are present in plasma cells and Burkitt lymphoma cells but are absent or inactive in lymphoblastoid cells. Since the distance between the rearranged immunoglobulin loci and the c-myc oncogene can even exceed 30-50 kilobases, we speculate that the translocated c-myc oncogene is under the transcriptional control of enhancer-like elements capable of acting over long distances. The activity of this long-range enhancer may depend on the interaction with transacting factors that are active in plasma cells and in Burkitt lymphoma cells but are not active in lymphoblastoid cells. We also examined the transcription of the first exon of the c-myc oncogene, which becomes separated from the second and third exon because of the chromosomal break involving the first intron. This exon is transcribed at high levels in ST486 Burkitt lymphoma cells with the t(8;14) chromosome translocation. Hybrids between lymphoblastoid and ST486 cells expressed high levels of transcripts of the first exon, whereas hybrids between plasma cells and ST486 cells did not. Thus, transcription of the separated first exon can be enhanced in lymphoblastoid and Burkitt lymphoma cells because of its close proximity to the heavy chain enhancer that is normally located between the joining and the switch region of the C mu gene. Such enhancement, however, does not occur in plasma cells, possibly because these cells are able to suppress completely the c-myc oncogene, unless it has been placed in the proximity of a rearranged immunoglobulin constant region gene.","['CA 16685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 31060/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC345243,,,,,,,

The affinity of the remaining surface receptors for diferric transferrin appeared to be unaltered. The time-dependent loss in transferrin receptors was also dependent upon PMA concentration, with a half-maximal effect observed at approximately 1 nM. The kinetic parameters for the binding, internalization, intracellular residency, and recycling of 125I-labeled transferrin were unchanged by PMA treatment, as were the rate and extent of internalization of anti-receptor antibody. Moreover, despite the decrease in surface receptors, uptake of 59Fe from transferrin proceeded at a rate comparable to that seen in untreated cells. Accounting for this observation was the fact that ligand induced a reduction in surface receptors in untreated but not PMA-treated cells. Quantitative immunoprecipitation of transferrin receptors from surface-iodinated K562 cells revealed that little receptor internalization occurred in untreated cells in the absence of ligand, but internalization of ligand-occupied receptors in these cells was readily detected. In contrast, PMA treatment resulted in the rapid internalization of surface receptors irrespective of occupancy. Thus, binding of ligand appeared to trigger the internalization of receptors that were relatively static in their unoccupied state, and a signal for receptor internalization was also provided by PMA treatment. The possibility that this signal involves phosphorylation of the transferrin receptor is discussed.",,PMC345209,,,,,,,

Determination of the total nucleotide sequence of the HTLV genome has revealed no typical onc gene acquired from the cellular sequence. Screening of the HTLV provirus genome in tumour cells has shown that in all cases of ATL examined, the primary tumour cells contained the provirus genome and were monoclonal with respect to the integration site of the provirus. These findings suggest that ATL leukaemogenesis may be due to insertional mutagenesis in which the provirus genome is integrated into a specific locus on the chromosomal DNA and then activates an adjacent cellular onc gene, a mechanism already demonstrated in avian lymphoma and erythroblastosis induced by avian leukosis viruses. A common site of HTLV provirus integration in leukaemic cells among some ATL patients was reported by Hahn et al. but subsequently retracted. However, this retraction does not imply the random integration of the proviruses. Independently, we have been testing this insertional mutagenesis model in ATL and report here that the provirus did not have a common locus of integration in 35 ATL patients and did not integrate on the same chromosome in 2 ATL patients.",['GM 20454/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

In DNA from the T-cells not expressing DR alpha mRNA, all of the potential HpaII sites within the BglII fragment appeared to be methylated. In contrast, at least some of these sites were not methylated in DNA from the B-cells expressing high levels of DR alpha mRNA. Treatment of these T-cells with 5-azacytidine resulted in the induction of DR surface antigen expression, the appearance of DR alpha mRNA, and the partial demethylation of the DR alpha DNA sequences. T-cell lines established from human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus associated T-cell neoplasias, in contrast to the T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia cell lines, expressed both DR antigens and DR alpha mRNA; the HpaII sites within the BglII fragment of DR alpha DNA of these human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus-positive T-cell lines were in all cases at least partially unmethylated. Uncultured peripheral blood T-cells from human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus-infected individuals expressed DR antigens at a low level, and the DR alpha locus was partially unmethylated. After 48 h in culture, DR antigen expression was substantially increased, but no significant changes were observed in methylation of the DR alpha locus or in the amount of DR mRNA which was present.

In addition, the binding affinity is enhanced by 4'-halogen or 4'-methoxy substituents, and by 7- or 2'-halogens. However, the affinity is decreased by substitutions at position 3 or 4. Central-type benzodiazepine binding in brain, on the other hand, is not affected by 1-alkyl groups and is inhibited by 4'-substitutions.

The NZB mouse carries two induction loci; both are distinct from Bxv -1 since neither is linked to the Pep-3 locus on chromosome 1. Finally, one partially inbred strain derived from the wild Japanese mouse, Mus musculus molossinus, carries multiple (at least three) unlinked loci for induction of xenotropic virus. Although it is probable that inbred strains inherited xenotropic virus inducibility from Japanese mice, our data suggest that none of the induction loci carried by this particular M. m. molossinus strain are allelic with Bxv -1.",,PMC254402,,,,,,,

The 24S RNA species was enriched in polyadenylate-selected preparations and thus may represent a message for endogenous viral envelope glycoproteins. The viral origin of the 24S RNA was further characterized by its hybridization to DNA probes containing the long terminal repeats of Harvey murine sarcoma virus, mouse mammary tumor virus, or the U3 region of an endogenous xenotropic virus. Although the env-related 24S RNA failed to react with either Harvey murine sarcoma virus or mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat probes, it hybridized well with the xenotropic virus long terminal repeat probe. Therefore, it is likely that the RNA detected with the Friend spleen focus-forming virus env probe reflects transcription of xenotropic envelope sequences in uninfected tissues.

Chickens from the Hyline SC and FP lines are, respectively, susceptible and resistant to avian leukosis virus-induced lymphoid leukosis. We examined plasma and cellular DNA obtained from avian leukosis virus-infected chickens for the presence of viremia and integrated viral sequences to determine whether the extent of virus infection is comparable in individuals of both lines. A less than twofold difference in the frequency of viremia was detected between chickens of the two different lines. Although the analysis of plasma samples, which were obtained at different times postinfection, demonstrated that the duration of viremia was comparable in both susceptible and resistant chickens, the onset of the viremia observed in susceptible chickens generally preceded by 1 week that observed in resistant chickens. Moreover, integrated viral sequences were detected in approximately 90% of the SC and 40% of the FP chickens. The appearance of infectious virus in the plasma was, in general, associated with the presence of integrated viral sequences in both the bursal cells and the erythrocytes obtained from the same chicken. The presence of both the viremia and the integrated viral DNA sequences was transient, suggesting a mechanism for the elimination of virus-infected cells in both susceptible and resistant chickens. Furthermore, at 5 weeks postinfection no integrated exogenous viral sequences were detected in splenic lymphocytes obtained from either chicken line, regardless of whether these chickens were viremic or had integrated viral sequences detectable in other tissues. Our results indicate that extensive avian leukosis virus replication occurs in approximately 50% of the FP and 100% of the SC chickens.

A high degree of nucleotide sequence homology between the feline leukemia virus and murine leukemia virus gag genes was observed, suggesting that retroviruses of domestic cats and laboratory mice have a common, proximal evolutionary progenitor. The predicted structure of the complete feline leukemia virus gag gene precursor suggests that the translation of nonglycosylated and glycosylated gag gene polypeptides is initiated at two different AUG codons. These initiator codons fall in the same reading frame and are separated by a 222-base-pair segment which encodes an amino terminal signal peptide. The nucleotide sequence predicts the order of amino acids in each of the individual gag-coded proteins (p15, p12, p30, p10), all of which derive from the gag gene precursor. Stable stem-and-loop secondary structures are proposed for two regions of viral RNA. The first falls within sequences at the 5' end of the viral genome, together with adjacent palindromic sequences which may play a role in dimer linkage of RNA subunits. The second includes coding sequences at the gag-pol junction and is proposed to be involved in translation of the pol gene product. Sequence analysis of the latter region shows that the gag and pol genes are translated in different reading frames. Classical consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences could not be localized to regions which would permit synthesis of the expected gag-pol precursor protein. Alternatively, we suggest that the pol gene product (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) could be translated by a frameshift suppressing mechanism which could involve cleavage modification of stems and loops in a manner similar to that observed in tRNA processing.",,PMC255750,,,['GENBANK/K01803'],,,,

In this study, we investigated the possibility of human NK cells to exhibit an oxidative burst (OB) after stimulation by K562, an NK-sensitive target cell (TC). The addition of catalase (CAT) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) to the NK-mediated cytotoxic assay had no effect on NK-CMC. In contrast, CAT and SOD effectively modulated the cytotoxicity mediated by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) against three different tumor TC, including K562. CAT abrogated, while SOD enhanced PMA-activated PMNL-mediated cytotoxicity. The synergistic effect of SOD and PMA was suppressed in a dose-dependent fashion by CAT. Furthermore, by chemiluminescence (CL) and SOD-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c, we failed to detect an OB associated with K562-stimulated NK cells. PMNL, however, rapidly responded to PMA (10 ng/ml), generating almost 10(6) cpm within 20 min and 26.7 nM O-2/10(6) cells/30 min, as detected by CL and reduction of cytochrome c, respectively. Finally, K562 alone, at cell concentrations corresponding to effector cell:target cell (EC:TC) ratios of 1:1 and 1:10, reduced cytochrome c, but this reduction was not inhibited by SOD, thus suggesting a diaphorase activity. Overall, we show that: a) tumor cell destruction by human NK cells and by PMA-activated PMNL is mediated by different mechanisms; and b) NK-CMC against a sensitive TC does not involve an OB.",,,,,,,,,

Leukemic cells of both groups were of the T3, T4-positive, T8-negative phenotype. Despite the similar phenotype, HTLV-negative Sezary leukemic cells frequently functioned as helper cells, whereas some HTLV-positive ATL and HTLV-positive Sezary cells appeared to function as suppressors of immunoglobulin synthesis. One can distinguish the HTLV-positive from the HTLV-negative leukemias using a monoclonal antibody (anti-Tac) that appears to identify the human receptor for T cell growth factor (TCGF). Resting normal T cells and most HTLV-negative Sezary cells were Tac-negative, whereas all ATL cell populations were Tac-positive.

On the contrary the Na+, K+-ATPase activity was initially enhanced and then returned to control levels during the early phase of induction by DMSO. On the other hand, 22Na+-transport into DMSO-treated cells was reduced similar to the ouabain sensitive 86Rb+ uptake in cells without Na+ preloading. The piretanide sensitive 86Rb+-uptake, due to the Na+, K+, 2Cl - cotransport system was inhibited after seven hours exposure to DMSO. Some three hours after DMSO addition the incorporation of 35S-methionine into proteins began to decrease, which was accompanied with or followed by a reduction in the methionine uptake of DMSO treated cells. Membrane-potential-dependent tetraphenylphosphonium cation uptake was not altered relative to the controls in the first 12 hours following DMSO addition. These results suggest that the reduced activity of the Na+, K+-pump in Friend cells after DMSO exposure is not due to inhibition of the Na+, K+-ATPase, but most probably due to a smaller Na+-influx, which results from inhibition of Na+-cotransport processes (amino acid uptake, Na+, K+, 2Cl - cotransport system).",,,,,,,,,

Here data are presented against this hypothesis and it is shown that low TfR expression and high NK sensitivity can occur concommitantly . K562 cells were studied at various stages of cell proliferation. No change in NK sensitivity could be observed between exponential growth and the plateau phase, whereas TfR expression completely disappeared during the latter. Protein synthesis inhibitors such as cycloheximide (1 microgram/ml, 48 h) and actinomycin D (50 micrograms/ml, 48 h), that abolished the TfR expression at the K562 cell surface, had no effect on NK sensitivity. Similarly, hemin induction (0.1 mM, 5 days) did not change NK susceptibility of K562 cells but considerably diminished TfR expression. Moreover, attempts to block NK sensitivity with anti-TfR monoclonal antibodies were unsuccessful, even when the 42.6 antibody, which is known to bind to the active site of TfR, was used. Finally, no blocking of NK sensitivity could be achieved when K562 cells were preincubated with saturating concentrations of transferrin or when transferrin was added during the NK assay. It therefore seems doubtful that TfR is the unique target structure for NK cells. It remains possible that TfR and NK target structures are often coexpressed on actively dividing cells.",,,,,,,,,

Retinoic acid induced similar cytosolic changes but less marked intranuclear increases. Nuclear increases did not occur in the differentiation-resistant subline, HL-60 Blast II, treated with dimethyl sulfoxide. DEAE-cellulose chromatography, as well as photoaffinity labeling and gel electrophoresis, disclosed higher ratios of type I to type II kinase in cytosol than in intranuclear fractions. Differences of the qualitative binding protein patterns between cytosol and nucleosol were enhanced following chemically induced differentiation. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP increased cytoplasmic and nuclear binding protein levels when given alone or in combination with retinoic acid or dimethyl sulfoxide, and it enhanced differentiation.

We have now observed that ACM and MCM are potent inhibitors of both total glycoprotein synthesis and the formation of lipid-linked oligosaccharide intermediates in intact HL-60 cells. This inhibitory activity was both concentration and time dependent and was maximal after 12 hr exposure to 30 nM ACM or MCM, conditions under which both cell growth and total protein synthesis were maintained at levels equal to those of untreated cells. In contrast, exposure of HL-60 cells to pyrromycin or Adriamycin, even at cytotoxic concentrations, did not result in specific decreases in the synthesis of glycoproteins containing asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. Maximum inhibition of the formation of lipid-linked intermediates by ACM or MCM preceded the loss of cell surface transferrin-binding activity (maximal at 24 hr), which in turn preceded the minimal exposure time necessary for significant induction of differentiation by either of the active anthracyclines (36 hr). These findings demonstrate a new biochemical site of action for ACM and MCM and suggest that this activity is involved in the induction of terminal differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells by these antitumor agents.","['CA-02617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-07330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

This came about through direct demonstration of retroviruses as etiological agents in certain human tumors and through the discovery of a set of cellular genes (onc genes) that may play important roles in normal and abnormal cell growth by their association with certain animal retroviruses. Cellular onc genes are a group of evolutionarily conserved sequences which are homologous to the transforming genes (v-onc) of oncogenic retroviruses. Although their functions in normal cells are largely not known, the sequence homology between cellular onc genes and the transforming v-onc genes is consistent with the idea that neoplastic transformation may, in some cases, be due to abnormal expression of these genes. We have approached this problem by molecular cloning of the human c-onc genes, using these as probes to examine the levels of expression and possible modification of these genes in different neoplastic and normal cells, and by determining their precise locations on the human chromosomes to correlate with known chromosomal alterations in human tumors. Through these studies, we provided evidence for gene amplification and chromosomal translocation as two mechanisms for c-onc activation in tumor cells and implicated the c-myc gene in Burkitt's lymphomas. Human T-cell leukemia virus is a family of related T-lymphotropic viruses isolated from humans. This is the first and thus far the only exogenous human retrovirus identified. A subgroup of this family, human T-cell leukemia virus I, is etiologically associated with a distinct subtype of mature T-cell cancer called adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma. This association is borne out by extensive seroepidemiology which revealed several regions of the world, including Southwestern Japan, the Caribbean Islands, and Africa, to be endemic; by demonstration of viral sequences clonally integrated in the adult T-cell leukemia cells; and, more remarkably, by the capacity of the virus to transform normal human T-cells in culture and in effect reproduce in vitro some of the in vivo leukemogenic events. Other subgroups that are distantly related to human T-cell leukemia virus I have been obtained from a patient with T-cell hairy cell leukemia and patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The full disease spectrum of these viruses remains to be determined.",,,,,,,,,

Freeze-thaw lysates of these peritoneal exudate cells were found to be as cytotoxic to P815 as their corresponding whole cells. The lytic activity of these lysates was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 X g, indicating the insolubility of the effector moiety. These cells were also shown to produce significant amounts of superoxide anion and H2O2 in response to phorbol myristate acetate. A catalase-inhibitable augmentation of the cytotoxicity of these cells against P815 was observed when phorbol myristate acetate was added to the assay. Neutrophils and not macrophages were likely responsible for this effect. Peritoneal lymphocytes from mice given injections of Adriamycin 5 to 7 days previously were cytotoxic to YAC-1 tumor cells in 4-hr assays.

While the HL-60 system does not reflect all of the features of normal hematopoiesis, it does provide a relatively well-defined in vitro experimental system which can be useful for examining aspects of the differentiation process. HL-60 cells were induced to undergo myeloid differentiation by retinoic acid. The subsequent differentiation kinetics of HL-60 populations initially enriched in different cell cycle phases was measured. This was compared to the cellular uptake of retinoic acid as a function of cell cycle position. If the initial differentiation-regulating event were cell cycle phase independent, then the kinetics of differentiation would be independent of the cell cycle status of the initial population. Flow cytometric cell sorting, based on cellular narrow angle and orthogonal light scatter intensity spectra, was used to select G1-enriched and S + G2 + M-enriched cell populations without pharmacological perturbation. These two populations were each induced to undergo myeloid differentiation with 10(-6) M beta-all-trans-retinoic acid. The kinetics of G1/0 arrest associated with terminal cell differentiation, as well as phenotypic differentiation, assayed by development of oxidative metabolism, was measured for both populations. The kinetics of differentiation differed for the two populations, indicating that the initial differentiation-regulating event was cell cycle phase specific. For both of the initial cell populations, significant phenotypic differentiation followed approximately 24 hr after enrichment in the relative number of S-phase cells. When exponentially proliferating HL-60 cells were exposed to a 1-hr pulse of 10(-5) M [3H]retinoic acid and then flow cytometrically sorted by DNA content, cells in late S + G2 + M had an approximately 10-fold higher uptake than cells in G1 or early S. The results indicate that cellular regulation of myeloid differentiation first becomes responsive to the inducer, retinoic acid, in S phase when uptake is enhanced.","['CA 31591/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Patients were also randomised to receive either sodium bicarbonate to render their urine neutral or no supplement. Follow up continued till death or to April 1983. Of 49 patients who survived more than 100 days, 39 achieved reversal of their renal failure (18 complete, 21 partial). Recovery of renal function, as assessed by a fall in the serum creatinine concentration, was achieved even when light chain proteinuria persisted. Partial recovery of renal function was associated with prolonged useful life in several patients. In only 14 of the 80 patients studied was death directly attributable to renal failure. Survival of patients in the study was appreciably better than in equivalent groups of patients in other MRC trials in which less stringent policies of fluid intake were used. Patients randomised to receive alkali fared marginally better than the others, but the difference was not significant. These results show that in many cases patients with myelomatosis who develop renal failure may have this complication reversed by taking a high fluid intake. Furthermore, though light chain is an essential component of renal disease in these patients, other factors are also important and are accessible to treatment.",,PMC1441033,,,,,,,

An additional splitting is obtained by the ring formation between C(3) and C(6)-OH.

Electron-spin resonance studies with the 5- nitroxystearate probe demonstrated that there was no appreciable change in microsomal lipid mobility as measured by the order parameters. In contrast, changes in lipid mobility were detected with the spin-label probe when microsomes were first isolated from Friend erythroleukemia cells and subsequently modified by incubation with liposomes composed of either dioleoyl- or dilinoleoylphosphatidylcholine plus bovine liver phospholipid-exchange protein. The fatty acid compositional changes produced in these microsomes were similar to those obtained when the intact cells were grown in media containing supplemental fatty acids.

These myelosarcomas had a host's age-associated pattern of growth identical to that of experimental tumors produced by sc transplantation of cells derived from malignant solid neoplasias. Thus, leukemia cells yielded either localized myelosarcomas at the site of inoculation or a disseminated neoplastic growth after inoculation in adult (more than 4 weeks old) or newborn (1-3 days old) nude mice, respectively. Human myeloid leukemia cells proliferating in the nude mice preserved the human karyotype and a surface antigenic determinant and did not influence the hematopoietic tissues of the host. The KG-1 and HL-60 cell lines consistently attained varying degrees of differentiation along the myeloid series in vitro, and these features were maintained during proliferation in the mice. Furthermore, cells of the variant subline KG-1a, which had a blastic morphology, developed signs of differentiation that were not seen in culture. The presence of readily identifiable markers, such as cytoplasmic granules containing myeloperoxidase, in the cell lines tested makes these models particularly useful for studying the influence of a biological environment on cell differentiation and its influence on tumor growth. These experimental systems are also suitable for investigating the mechanism(s) of metastases and for in vivo experimental therapeutic trials.",['FR-5541/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Platelet count is permanently above 800 X 10(9)/l (mean : 1 500 X 10(9)/l); mild hyperleukocytosis (mean : 16 X 10(9)/l) with predominant neutrophil polynuclears is usual but myelemia is not constant (28% of cases) and always very moderate; red cell parameters are normal in three-fourths of cases, while the remaining patients have anemia, either due to iron depletion or not. Reticulinic myelofibrosis, usually minimal, is found in 40% of cases. Medullary karyotype is always normal, without chromosome Ph1. Platelet functional abnormalities are not constant and do not correlate with the magnitude of thrombocythemia. 51 patients (84%) received myelosuppressive therapy, mainly by busulfan or radioactive phosphorus.

Plaque assays of VSV (HTLV) pseudotypes were employed to determine the presence of (i) HTLV receptors on cells and (ii) neutralizing antibodies in the serum of patients with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL). Cell surface receptors for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 were found on nonlymphoid cells of human and mammalian origin. Neutralizing antibodies specific to VSV(HTLV-1) were found in sera of ATLL patients in titers varying from 1:50 to 1:30,000 and did not correlate closely with antibody titers for internal viral antigens. Sera from ATLL patients in the United Kingdom (Caribbean immigrants), United States, and Japan completely neutralized VSV (HTLV-1), indicating that the HTLV isolates from these distinct geographic regions represent a single envelope serotype. Neutralization of VSV (HTLV-1) was more specific and more sensitive than assays of syncytium inhibition. No cross-neutralization was observed between bovine leukosis virus and HTLV, and only limited cross-reaction was found for envelope antigens of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. These studies show that VSV (HTLV) pseudotypes can be readily used to screen for neutralizing antibodies in patients' sera and to distinguish HTLV envelope serotypes.",,PMC345177,,,,,,,

Leukemic cells of all 88 cases of ATL tested so far were found to contain the provirus genome and also found to be monoclonal with respect to the integration site of provirus genome. In most cases of ATL, leukemic cells contained one or two copies of the complete HTLV provirus genome, and it was shown that the single species of HTLV with a fully determined sequence is typical in ATL. Some cases of T-cell malignancies, diagnosed as chronic lymphocytic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, also had the provirus genome in their tumor cells, whereas some cases with the same diagnosis did not. No cases of other types of lymphoma or leukemia contained the provirus genome in their tumor cells. Monoclonal integration of the HTLV provirus genome in all primary tumor cells of ATL not only indicates that HTLV directly interacts with target cells, which become leukemic, and that integration of the provirus genome is a prerequisite for development of ATL and possibly other related diseases but also indicates that the virus is not associated with other types of lymphoma or leukemia.",,PMC345097,,,,,,,

The PDGF competitor activity detected in a radioreceptor assay does not reflect irreversible (e.g., proteolytic) damage to the receptor of test cells since its effects are reversed by acetic acid dissociation. Antiserum against human PDGF neutralizes 20-80% of the PDGF competitor found in conditioned medium from different transformed human cells and 100% of the activity from normal human endothelial cells.

We were successful in continuously inhibiting FELC differentiation by PMA up to 125 weeks (about 240 serial passages of cells in the presence of PMA). During that period, FELC can be induced to differentiate and enter terminal cell division upon removal of PMA. PMA-mediated suppression of FELC differentiation was associated with only a low level of globin mRNA accumulation. However, a rapid accumulation of globin mRNA in the cytoplasm followed by hemoglobin accumulation occurred upon removal of PMA. A specific, saturable, high-affinity receptor for phorbol esters is present in FELC, as was shown by binding studies with [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. A significant (80%) loss in the number of phorbol ester receptors of FELC was observed after a continuous inhibition of differentiation by PMA for as much as 125 weeks. Despite such a down regulation of phorbol ester receptors, these cells respond to PMA with a dose-response similar to that of their parent cells, which have the normal number of phorbol ester receptors. Thus, PMA can suppress reversibly the accumulation of globin-specific mRNA and terminal differentiation of FELC during prolonged periods, despite loss of receptor sites, and our results suggest that only few phorbol ester receptors may be necessary for complete inhibition of FELC differentiation by PMA.",,PMC345439,,,,,,,

There appears to be a selective antileukemic dose response relationship when compared to normal hematopoietic elements. Etoposide is effective when administered orally at about twice the recommended parenteral dosage. Schedule dependency in both animal models and clinical trials has been observed; multiple dosing over three to five consecutive days is superior to weekly single dose administration. Etoposide's dose-limiting toxicity is myelosuppression (leukopenia), which is quite predictable; alopecia and Gl toxicity (nausea, vomiting, stomatitis) occur in about 20-30% of patients given recommended dosages. Etoposide appears to be one of the most active drugs for small cell lung cancer, testicular carcinoma (the Food and Drug Administration approved indication), ANLL and malignant lymphoma. Etoposide also has demonstrated activity in refractory pediatric neoplasms, hepatocellular, esophageal, gastric and prostatic carcinoma, ovarian cancer, chronic and acute leukemias and non-small cell lung cancer, although additional single and combination drug studies are needed to substantiate these data. Its contribution in front-line combination chemotherapeutic regimens for these cancers will be better defined in the forthcoming years. Etoposide appears to have minimal activity in breast cancer and, based on current data, it is inactive against malignant melanoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma and cancer of the head and neck, although the dosage and schedules used in many of the Phase II studies may have been suboptimal.","['CA 24176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 005584-18/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,140,,,,,

We found no HTLV-II expression in non-lymphoid tissues although expression and correct initiation of transcription was observed in B and T lymphocytes.

Although much is known about the structures of V and J segments, both in germ-line configuration and after rearrangement, essentially nothing is known about the biochemical mechanism of V-J recombination. One possible step in proposed mechanisms of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement is endonucleolytic cleavage of the participating DNA segments before joining. In an attempt to detect such an activity, we have developed an assay for the detection of site-specific double- or single-strand endonucleolytic activity in crude soluble extracts. Using this assay we have detected an activity in extracts of nuclei from mouse B-lymphoid lines and from mouse L cells that is capable of introducing duplex breaks near the recombinational signal sequences of immunoglobulin JK segments. We report the activity here because of its intrinsic interest although we lack any direct evidence that it has a role in V-J recombination.",,,,,,,,,

To help define the genetic mechanisms of feline lymphomagenesis we have explored here the possibility that cellular oncogenes (c-onc genes) are rearranged in tumour cell DNA. Of 16 FeLV-positive T-cell tumours among 31 naturally occurring lymphomas, 2 showed evidence of recombinant FeLV proviruses containing myc oncogene sequences. One of the two produced a transmissible myc-containing FeLV. In both cases c-myc and its surrounding DNA appeared unaltered. We believe that the association of myc with FeLV may result in its activation and play a part in the development of a significant fraction of cat T-cell lymphomas. Our findings contrast with studies of experimental induction of chicken lymphoma, in which myc activation occurs by retrovirus promoter insertion near c-myc (refs 3-5), rather than by incorporation into virus.",,,,,,,,,

We used the 1.5 kilobase (kb) PstI fragment of MC29 v-myc in Southern blot analysis to characterize the structure of the c-myc locus in the DNA of 31 naturally occurring feline lymphomas. Analysis of a cloned c-myc gene from one lymphoma demonstrated that sequences homologous to v-myc occupy 2.6 kb of feline DNA in which a putative intron of 0.5 kb separates sequences homologous to the 5' and 3' exons represented in avian v-myc. We also observed in the DNA of this lymphoma tumour-specific fragments homologous to v-myc.

Clinical effectiveness on isolated organisms (27 cases): In single infection (21 cases), the efficacy rates were 80% for Gram-positive cocci, including S. aureus and 63.6% for Gram-negative bacilli other than P. aeruginosa. In mixed infection (6 cases), the rate was 50.0%. There were no significant differences in the efficacy rates for those patients who were grouped by the initial number of neutrophil (less than 100, 101--500 and over 501/mm3).

The characteristics (time course, concentration dependence, stereospecificity, and metabolic dependence) of the calcium response are extremely similar to those previously described in human neutrophils. These results imply that functional receptors for leukotriene B4 appear in HL60 cells upon the induction of differentiation and also lend strong support to the use of these HL60 cells as a model of human myeloid differentiation. We have also characterized the emergence of a secretory response to fMet-Leu-Phe and leukotriene B4 in cytochalasin B treated HL60 cells. In addition, it is found that differentiation was required for the calcium ionophore A23187 to express its secretory activity toward the HL60 cells.

In the presence of Ca2+, lymphocyte Cam migrated as a single protein on 2-DE, and was located on the same position as Cam extracted from dog brain and rat testis; its MW was 17,500, with a pI of 3.9. In the presence of Ca2+, lymphocyte Cam stimulated activator-depleted dog brain phosphodiesterase; this effect was inhibited by trifluoperazine (TFP) or by EGTA. By the RIA technique, the EGTA-soluble Cam content of resting lymphocytes constituted 0.58% of the total protein; the total Cam was comparable to the content of other major proteins in lymphocytes, such as actin, tubulin, and intermediate filament protein. The amount of Cam per cell and the rate of incorporation of L-[35S]methionine into Cam increased after mitogen-induced transformation. Immunofluorescence labeling of normal, mitogen-transformed, and EBV-genome-positive lymphocytes with affinity-purified anti-Cam antibodies showed bright fluorescence in the region of the Golgi apparatus, as well as diffuse cytoplasmic but scant nuclear staining. Similar patterns were observed in T suppressor, T helper, and B cells. Normal lymphocytes cultured in the presence of 2 X 10(-5) M TFP remained viable, but failed to undergo blastogenic transformation after stimulation with allogeneic cells, concanavalin A (Con A), or pokeweed mitogen (PWM). The same concentration of TFP inhibited the replication of EBV-genome-positive and of leukemia cells. Exposure of natural killer cells or allospecific killer cells to this concentration of TFP inhibited the effector phase of killing in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of lower concentrations of TFP (0.25-1.0 X 10(-5) M) strong MLC responses were inhibited, while weak reactions were markedly amplified. A similar effect was not observed in lymphocytes stimulated into blastogenesis by lectins, suggesting that different Cam-dependent secondary messenger(s) may be involved in the blastogenic responses evoked by alloantigenic determinants. The amplification of weak MLC responses by 0.25-1.0 X 10(-5) M TFP constitutes the first biological illustration of the capacity of a Cam-binding agent to enhance as well as to inhibit cellular activation. The paradoxical effect may have been a consequence of a shift in the relative concentrations of the four known molecular Cam X Ca2+ conformers.

It is therefore possible that doxorubicin resistance is associated with increased intracellular enzyme capacity to convert these superoxide radicals to inactive metabolites. We have measured the relative activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase in P388 mouse leukemia cells and in a doxorubicin-resistant subline. Since oxygen-reactive metabolites also play a role in mediating the cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation, the radiosensitivity of both cell lines was also studied. No significant differences in superoxide dismutase activity between these cell lines was observed, indicating that they have a similar capacity to convert superoxide anion radicals to hydrogen peroxide. P388 cells that are resistant to doxorubicin have 1.5 times the glutathione content and 1.5 times the activity of glutathione peroxidase measured in drug-sensitive P388 cells. However, incubation with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, which covalently binds glutathione, had no effect on the sensitivity of either cell line to doxorubicin. Measured catalase activity in drug-resistant P388 cells was one-third of the activity measured in doxorubicin-sensitive P388 cells. The activity of this enzyme was much higher than that of glutathione peroxidase in terms of H2O2 deactivation in both cell lines. It is therefore unlikely that doxorubicin-resistant P388 cells have an increased ability to detoxify reactive oxygen metabolites when compared to drug-sensitive cells. Doxorubicin-resistant P388 cells were significantly more sensitive to X-irradiation than were drug-sensitive P388 cells. These observations suggest that the difference in catalase activity in these cell lines may be associated with the observed differences in radiosensitivity.",,,,,,,,,

TPA caused HL-60 cell adhesion concomitant with morphological changes, and an increase in acid phosphatase activity. The median effective concentration was 1 nM, which corresponded well to the dissociation constant of [3H]TPA binding to the cell extract. [3H]TPA binding to the cell extract was saturable and reversible. The maximal number of [3H]TPA-binding sites was 1.5 pmol/mg protein and a Hill coefficient was unity, indicating noncooperative interactions. PC, but neither palmitic acid nor DL-carnitine, inhibited the TPA-induced cell adhesion and morphological changes with the median inhibitory concentration of 1 microM, whereas a TPA-induced increase in acid phosphatase activity was not affected by 3 microM PC. Addition of PC 1 or 2 days after the addition of TPA was also effective in inhibiting the cell adhesion. Among various acylcarnitines, PC had the largest effect. [3H]TPA binding to the cell extract was not inhibited by PC at the concentration which was effective in inhibiting the TPA-induced cell adhesion.

It is suggested that these differences do not play a role in the mechanism of resistance to doxorubicin. Rather they reflect alterations in plasma membrane composition and structure between these cell lines. This study also suggests that the use of decreased 5'-nucleotidase activity as a marker of certain leukaemias should be reviewed with caution.

These homogenates also catalyze the formation of adducts of halogenated nitrobenzene with glutathione, as determined spectrophotometrically. While all the classical glutathione S-transferase activity resides in the soluble fraction of the homogenates, the thiol ether leukotriene-generating activity is found in the particulate fraction. This ""leukotriene C synthetase"" activity has been solubilized from a crude high-speed particulate fraction by means of the nonionic detergent, Triton X-100. The solubilized enzyme is incapable of converting 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene to a colored product in the presence of glutathione. Nor will it react with 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene. On the other hand, under optimal conditions, this enzyme preparation is capable of generating about 0.1 nmol leukotriene C mg protein-1 min-1 in a reaction which continues in linear fashion for at least 10 min. This dissociation in substrate specificity, as well as differences in the inhibition profile, distinguish the enzyme activity in the particulate fraction from rat basophil leukemia cell homogenates from the microsomal glutathione S-transferase which has been described in rat liver homogenates, suggesting that this ""leukotriene C synthetase"" is a new and unique enzyme.",,,,,,,,,

The most characteristic diagnostic feature in our series was the presence of highly pleomorphic and lobated lymphoid cells in the peripheral blood. Also notable was acid phosphatase activity which was partially tartrate-resistant in the neoplastic cells. The pathologic spectrum of the associated lymphomas was broad and encompassed several diffuse histologic subtypes in the Rappaport classification, the working formulation, and the classification of the Japanese lymphoma study group. However, differences in survival could not be correlated with differences in histologic subtype. All patients presented with Ann Arbor Stage IV lymphoma. Other common clinical features were generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, skin and peripheral blood involvement, hypercalcemia, and lytic bone lesions. The clinical course was aggressive with a median survival of 9 months. In two-third of patients with cutaneous involvement, epidermal infiltration resembling Pautrier microabscesses was observed. However, most cases can be readily distinguished from mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome on clinical and epidemiologic grounds.

The absolute effectiveness of granulocyte transfusion therapy is influenced by the quality of the transfusions and the immune status of both the recipient and the granulocyte donor. The indiscriminate transfusion of inadequate quantities of granulocytes from random donors into sensitized recipients should be discouraged. Severely neutropenic patients with established infection unresponsive to antibiotic therapy are appropriate recipients of granulocyte transfusions. Well-designed programs of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions can reduce the occurrence of bacterial infection in neutropenic patients, but there are few clinical situations in which their use is justified.

The neonatally injected mice were permissive for both viral replication and virus-induced cell-surface antigen expression on thymus cells, peripheral T and B lymphocytes, and macrophages, whereas the M-MuLV was not present in the adult i.p. injected mice. Instead, in i.t. injected mice, the virus was expressed in thymus and peripheral T cells only, but was not detected in tail extracts as assessed by means of the UV-XC plaque assay. Lack of virus spread in adult-treated animals correlated with a prompt humoral and cellular immune response, whereas the highly viremic newborn inoculated mice showed negligible virus-specific antibody production and an extremely low frequency of splenic cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors. Moreover, immune response in both groups of adult-treated mice efficiently prevented tumor induction by Moloney-murine sarcoma virus (M-MuSV), which has the same antigenic determinants as M-MuLV, its natural helper. In contrast, M-MuSV sarcomas grew progressively in newborn inoculated mice and killed the host. Finally, 80% of neonatally injected mice developed lymphomas, whereas all treated adults remained free of disease for more than 15 months. These findings imply that the immune response may, in fact, prevent retrovirus-induced oncogenesis through restriction of virus replication and/or destruction of virus-infected cells.",,,,,,,,,

Human antibodies directed against E. histolytica were capable of inhibiting the cytotoxic action of pathogenic amebae against K562 and MH1C1 within the first 30-60 min of the assay, revealing a kinetic pattern nearly identical with that observed with apathogenic amebae against K562.

The virus produced by SQ-A cells induces erythroleukemia associated with anemia in adult mice but has little activity when assayed on XC cells. It was characterized to determine what factors influence its leukemogenic potential. As compared to the attenuated virus from cultures of 5-86 and G-2 cells, the subunits of the RNA from the virions of SQ-A cells are the same size, and the amount of reverse transcriptase activity and RNase H present in the purified virions of the three lines are similar. However, differences are observed in levels of endonuclease and protein kinase. Both enzymes are increased in SQ-A virions. The activity of protein kinase in SQ-A virions is about 5 times higher than that in the attenuated virions. The number of polypeptides and their phosphorylation patterns also distinguish the virions of SQ-A.

The viral probes used hybridized with only four cosmids, containing overlapping mouse sequences, that define four class I gene-related sequences in a region of 90 kilobases of DNA. The data show that two distinct viral envelope sequences are contained in the cluster. One of these sequences is situated with its 3' end next to the 3' end of a class I sequence. The other sequence, which does not contain the entire viral envelope, is proximal to the 3' end of a different class I sequence. Hybridization of the viral probes with the H-2 cosmid clones does not appear to be due to homology between viral and H-2 sequences.

All members of one set of subclones expressed a V kappa 21 kappa light chain. Only one of the members of the other two sets of subclones expressed V kappa 21. Thus, a single pre-B-cell clone can select a kappa variable region from more than one family. In each subclone of the set that expressed V kappa 21 light chain the same member appears to be used. The differences detected in the expressed proteins can best be explained by primary sequence alterations in the rearranged V kappa 21 segment. These sequence alterations have resulted in a restriction site polymorphism in the expressed V kappa 21 gene and charge and size differences in the expressed proteins. These data suggest that diversification of kappa light chains can occur at the pre-B- to early B-cell stage of development.",,PMC344870,,,,,,,

Imidazole treatment (i) causes moderate inhibition of 125I-labeled transferrin binding to both control and Me2SO-treated MEL cells; (ii) markedly suppresses Me2SO-induced activation of iron uptake into MEL cells; (iii) markedly decreases the incorporation of iron into ferritin; and (iv) abolishes heme biosynthesis from [2-14C]glycine and hemoglobin accumulation in Me2SO-treated cells. Imidazole treatment does not inhibit other aspects of cellular maturation; cells treated with Me2SO in the presence or absence of imidazole exhibit similar changes in proliferative activity and protein synthesis and, as shown previously, in cell morphology. Inhibition of hemoglobin accumulation in MEL cells is reversible on withdrawal of imidazole but is not altered by exogenous hemin.

To localize the determinant of SL3-3's leukaemogenicity more precisely we have now construced a recombinant provirus containing the LTR of SL3-3 and the coding region of Akv. The leukaemogenicity of these recombinants demonstrates that the determinant of leukaemogenicity lies within the SL3-3 LTR.

T1-oligonucleotide fingerprinting and mapping of viral RNAs from unpassaged isolates revealed the presence of complex mixtures of viral genomes. MuLV that were purified by endpoint dilution were genetically heterogeneous. Thus, endogenous retroviral sequences expressed in the tissues of HRS/J mice readily recombined with one another. Furthermore, the regular recovery of recombinant ecotropic MuLV suggested reciprocal in vivo complementation of a genetic defect(s) in each of the endogenous ecotropic proviruses Emv-1 and Emv-3. Some recombinant ecotropic viruses contained sequences in the p15E-U3 region that were not derived from Emv-1 and Emv-3 but were found in recombinant polytropic HRS/J viruses. Finally, comparison of the genetic structures of leukemogenic and nonleukemogenic MuLV of this strain implied that the oncogenic phenotype of these MuLV is encoded within env or the U3 region of the genome or both.

In all cases, we found that there was a predominant (70 to 90%) Coomassie Brilliant Blue-staining p30 spot, as well as several other species which differed in pI. The major p30 spot differed in pI among different MuLV strains and the minor spots varied depending on the host cell used to grow the virus. Specifically, (i) Moloney (M)-MuLV/NIH-3T3 showed two spots, a major one at pI 6.3 and a more acidic one, (ii) AKR/NIH-3T3, AKR/mouse embryo, and Gross/NIH-3T3 showed four spots, with the two basic, minor spots of AKR/NIH-3T3 appearing relatively decreased in intensity, and (iii) Rauscher (R)-MuLV/JLS-V9 (BALB/c) showed two spots, a major one with greater than 90% of the estimated Coomassie Brilliant Blue stain at a pI of 6.5 and a minor, acidic one. The major spots of AKR and M-MuLV viruses also differed in pI. The major spot of the AKR and Gross N-tropic viruses had a pI of 6.7 while that of NB-tropic virus M-MuLV had a pI of 6.3. The possibility that the heterogeneity observed in p30 was an artefact of the 2D gel technique had to be considered since urea was used to denature proteins in the first dimension of the gel. This possibility was made unlikely by our finding that another technique, chromatofocusing, gave the same results. Specifically, M-MuLV/JLS-V9 p30, when separated on chromatofocusing columns under non-denaturing conditions yielded three peaks, each of which directly corresponded to the three spots (pI: 6.1, 6.3, 6.6) observed on 2D gels. Furthermore, tryptic peptide maps of the major (pI 6.3) and one of the minor (pI 6.6) M-MuLV spots, although very similar in peptide composition, showed about five clearly defined differences. These results indicate (i) that the p30s of several N- and NB-tropic viruses are heterogeneous in pI, and (ii) for one particular MuLV, the p30 heterogeneity can be explained by a difference in amino acid composition. These findings of p30 charge heterogeneity may reflect either the presence of several different p30s in each virus particle and/or a heterogeneity in the virus population.",['CA-27708/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

The biochemical analysis of the antigens that reacted with rat sera revealed that they are the two HTLV-specific polypeptides, p24 and p28.",,PMC2187267,,,,,,,

After crossing him with laboratory stock mice, a mouse of very unusual phenotype appeared from a yellow (AyA) mother. He was yellow with black dorsal stripes; hence Tiger. He was mated to many females, and inbred F2 and F3 generations were raised. There were no more tiger phenotypes, but his F1 contained an excess of black-and-tans over yellows, showing him to be a gonosomic mosaic Ayat/atat; the homozygous cell line probably arose from the heterozygous one. The mitotic karyotype was normal. Some of Tiger's mates were of known allozyme types and their progeny were scored. The allozyme segregations were normal, except at the Es-3 locus (esterase-3), for which Tiger was typed as homozygous. Several unusual events among Tiger's close relatives included a mutation to an unstable pattern mutant, three probable translocations, and several cases of somatic defect. All unusual mice derived from Tiger's yellow mother, whose genome was one-quarter Peruvian. Yellow is associated with an ecotropic murine leukemia virus. The Peru genome is characterized by a high occurrence of mutation and aberrant karyotypes. It is suggested that something from the Peru genome in Tiger's mother caused instability of the DNA sequence associated with yellow, with related disturbance at different locations thereafter. The nature of this instability, and of the Peru genome, is discussed.",,,,,,,,,

(1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6567-6574). We have taken advantage of the selective phosphorylation of the 100,000-Da subunit in purified plasma membranes and the similarity between the proteolysis patterns of the MEL cell and dog kidney (Na,K)-ATPase to map the site of kinase phosphorylation on the MEL cell enzyme. The chymotryptic and tryptic cleavage sites of the dog kidney (Na,K)-ATPase have previously been located (Castro, J., and Farley, R. A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 2221-2228). The 100,000-Da catalytic subunits of the dog kidney and MEL cell enzymes were specifically labeled at the active site aspartate residue by incubation with (32P)orthophosphate in the presence of Mg2+ and ouabain. Digestion of these two enzymes with chymotrypsin or trypsin revealed similar active site aspartate containing proteolytic fragments indicating a similar structure for the two enzymes. Chymotryptic digestions of MEL cell (Na,K)-ATPase labeled in vitro with [gamma-32P]ATP localize the region of kinase phosphorylation to within a 35,000-Da peptide derived from the middle of the 100,000-Da subunit. Tryptic digestion of the MEL cell plasma membranes degraded the 100,000-Da subunit to an NH2-terminal 43,000-Da peptide which contained the active site aspartate but which did not contain the kinase-labeled region. These results further locate the region of kinase phosphorylation to the COOH-terminal half of the 35,000-Da chymotryptic peptide. This location places the site of phosphorylation between the active site aspartate residue which accepts the phosphate of ATP during turnover and an ATP-binding site which has previously been located by labeling with fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate (Carilli, C. T., Farley, R. A., Perlman, D. M., and Cantley, L. C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 5601-5606). Phosphorylation of the (Na,K)-ATPase in this region may serve to regulate the activity of this enzyme.","['GM 26199/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 28538/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

NADPH oxidase activity, measured as NADPH-dependent superoxide production, increased with both spontaneous and N,N-dimethylformamide-induced differentiation. Activity in particulate fractions from induced HL-60 cells and human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes was proportional to their relative rates of superoxide production, but activity from uninduced cells was surprisingly high: one-third that from induced cells, despite only 7% their rate of superoxide generation. NADPH oxidase activities in phagocytic vesicles from induced HL-60 cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were equal, indicating the equivalence of the enzyme system in active portions of their cell membranes. Separation by centrifugal elutriation of the HL-60 cell population into fractions of varying maturity confirmed the relationship of NADPH oxidase activity to advancing differentiation in both dimethylformamide-induced and spontaneously maturing cells. Membrane potential change, an early event related to activation of the oxidase, was followed by 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine dye fluorescence. The depolarization response increased dramatically in both magnitude and initial rate of change during differentiation. The cells' cytochrome b content increased 3-fold with induction of differentiation, in proportion to the change in NADPH oxidase activity.","['AM-31056/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-31097/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

When cells were incubated in the presence of N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate to block de novo biosynthesis, plasma concentrations of uridine maintained normal cell growth. De novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, as determined by [14C]sodium bicarbonate incorporation into uracil nucleotides, was affected by the low concentrations of uridine found in the plasma. Below 1 microM uridine, de novo biosynthesis was not affected; between 3 and 5 microM uridine, de novo biosynthesis was inhibited by approximately 50%; and above 12 microM uridine, de novo biosynthesis was inhibited by greater than 95%. Inhibition of de novo biosynthesis correlated with an increase in the uracil nucleotide pool. The de novo pathway was much more sensitive to the uracil nucleotide pool size than was the salvage pathway, such that when de novo biosynthesis was inhibited by greater than 95% the uracil nucleotide pool continued to expand and the cells continued to take up [14C]uridine. Thus, the pyrimidine requirements of cultured L1210 cells can be met by concentrations of uridine found in the plasma and, when exposed to such physiologic concentrations, L1210 cells decrease their dependency on de novo biosynthesis and utilize their salvage pathway. Circulating uridine, therefore, may be of physiologic importance and could be an important determinant in anti-pyrimidine chemotherapy.",,,,,,,,,

The antitumor activity of FUra was significantly potentiated when GMP was administered either 0-60 min before or 5 min after FUra. The potentiated increase in lifespan (ILS) was almost the same as after simultaneous injection of the two agents. Coadministration of FUra and GMP increased the antitumor activity as compared with the respective dose of FUra alone in a treatment schedule of either day 1 only or days 1-9. The multiple-dose regimen (days 1-9) was more effective than a single high-dose regimen, and a GMP/FUra molar ratio of 4 seems to achieve the best therapeutic results against P388 leukemia.

Cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr and herpes simplex viruses, organisms that commonly affect male homosexuals, may produce some features of AIDS. Individually or collectively, however, they can not account for the emergence of a previously unrecognized clinical syndrome. Hepatitis B is prevalent in patients with AIDS and may play a role as a co-factor in the disease. The properties of a number of other known viruses may provide a model for the pathogenesis of some features of the AIDS immunodeficiency. Newly described simian acquired immune deficiency syndrome (SAIDS) is the best available animal model. In man, the retrovirus, human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) may play a role in AIDS.

The rate of degradation of 125I-LDL in the leukemic cells was four to 25 times higher than that in normal wbcs. The accumulation of LDL-incorporated AD-32 was greater than that of the free drug and could be reduced by the addition of native LDL in excess. AD-32-LDL was as effective as native LDL in inhibiting the degradation of 125I-LDL. Preincubation of wbcs in a lipoprotein-deficient medium enhanced both the degradation of 125I-LDL and the cellular drug accumulation on incubation with AD-32-LDL. Heparin inhibited both the high-affinity degradation of 125I-LDL and the cellular accumulation of LDL-incorporated drug. However, comparison of the high-affinity degradation rate of 125I-LDL and the accumulation of LDL-incorporated AD-32 showed that the cellular drug accumulation markedly exceeded that which could be explained by high-affinity uptake and degradation of AD-32-LDL. Furthermore, saturation of the cellular uptake of LDL-incorporated drug occurred at higher LDL concentrations than saturation of 125I-LDL degradation. The results indicate that cellular uptake of AD-32-LDL is partly mediated by the LDL receptor pathway and partly by a nonspecific mechanism.",,,,,,,,,

There were, however, marked differences between the ethyl and methyl derivatives of glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) when tested in cultured L1210 cells. The cellular accumulation of ethylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) represented only a fraction (20-25%) of that of the methyl derivative. Moreover, polyamine depletion, which is known to strikingly stimulate the uptake of methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), decreased, if anything, the uptake of ethylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) by L1210 cells. The compound produced spermidine and spermine depletion fully comparable to that achieved with methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) at micromolar concentrations. Ethylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) was growth-inhibitory to L1210 cells and produced an additive antiproliferative action when used together with 2-difluoromethylornithine. Ethylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) was distinctly less effective than methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) in releasing bound polyamines from isolated cell organelles in vitro. Ethylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) was also devoid of the early and profound mitochondrial toxicity typical to methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone). These findings may indicate that this compound is a more specific inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis with less intracellular polyamine 'receptor-site' activity than methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone).",,,,,,,,,

Blasts from certain patients with myelomonocytic and monocytic leukaemia behaved like efficient killer cells. Conversely, leukaemic myeloblasts and promyelocytes as well as leukaemic lymphoblasts were ineffective. Blast cells capable of inducing the target cell lysis were also capable of mounting an oxidative respiratory burst upon challenge with PMA, as detected by the superoxide anion release. N-ethyl-maleimide, superoxide dismutase and catalase completely inhibited the cytotoxicity by monocytoid blast cells, suggesting the involvement of oxygen reactive products in the lethal hit itself.

A replication-competent helper virus, with protein composition nearly identical to that of Mo-MuLV was isolated from the viruses produced by MuSV349 cells. This helper MuLV after it was separated from MuSV and upon infection of TB cells produced viral titer similar to that of Mo-MuLV-infected TB cells indicating that its replication might have been restricted in the MuSV349 cells. To find out whether the suppression of the helper virus replication is due to the genetic peculiarities of the virus or MuSV349 cells, the relative amounts of MuLV and MuSV produced by several distinct clonal MuSV isolates (derived from a common progenitor) upon superinfection with Mo-MuLV were determined. The results of these experiments showed that while both SV7 and SV15F on coinfection with Mo-MuLV produced MuSV in excess over MuLV; and ts110 and tsSV13 on coinfection with Mo-MuLV produced MuLV in excess over MuSV. Since the same Mo-MuLV is used in these experiments and since upon transfer to a different cell, SV7, SV15F, and ts110 retain the property to restrict or not restrict MuLV replication it appears that the above property is determined by the genetics of the MuSV.",['CA 19723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Analysis of 31 backcross mice shows complete concordance between inheritance of this fragment and resistance to Friend virus complex-induced erythroblastosis. Inheritance of this sequence also suppresses spontaneous expression of the endogenous ecotropic viruses carried by M. m. molossinus.

Infectious virus cannot be induced from mice carrying only the Fv-4r-associated sequence. Examination of other wild-derived mice resistant to Friend virus complex shows that Mus cervicolor cervicolor also contains the Fv-4r sequence.

In contrast to the original leukemic T cells that showed a complete lack of suppressor activity, the proliferating T-CLL cells were extremely potent inhibitors of mitogen, antigen and alloantigen induced lymphoproliferative responses. Compared to the fresh T-CLL cells, the proliferating T-CLL cells showed an enhanced expression of the human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV) p19 antigen and released type C virus particles into their culture supernatant. A direct involvement of the virus particles in the suppression was however unlikely, since the inhibition was found to be mediated by a soluble inhibitor in the culture supernatant of proliferating T-CLL cells. This inhibitor was very hydrophobic and was inactivated by treatment with trypsin, by heating to 56 degrees C for 2 h and by storage at -70 degrees C for more than 14 weeks. It could be excluded that the suppression of lymphoproliferation was due to competition for IL-2, to toxic effects, to nutrient depletion or to a shift in the kinetics of the target cell responses. Furthermore, it could not be attributed to suppressor inducer activity of the OKT4+ proliferating T-CLL cells, since normal T cells enriched for OKT4+ T cells and depleted for OKT8+ T cells were also inhibited in their proliferation. Since other hemopoietic cell lines, not of OKT4+ T lymphocyte origin, also were suppressed to proliferate, it is concluded that the proliferating T-CLL cells represent a neoplastic T-cell clone that had differentiated into suppressor effector T cells after prolonged culture in the presence of IL-2.",,,,,,,,,

Comparison of the T-CLL cell line with the original leukemic T cells revealed that both the fresh and the proliferating T-CLL cells were pleomorphic cells that showed a convoluted nucleus and formed rosettes with sheep erythrocytes (E-rosettes). They were reactive with the monoclonal antibodies OKT1, OKT4 and OKT11, but not with OKT3, OKT6 or OKT8, indicating that they were mature T cells but that they differed from normal T cells in their lack of reactivity with OKT3. In addition they did not bind peanut agglutinin or OKM-1, and were negative for Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen, surface immunoglobulin, non-specific esterase activity of Fc- or complement receptors. Part of the fresh T-CLL cells reacted with a monoclonal antibody recognizing HLA-DR antigens (p29, 34) (36%) and with anti-Tac (62%), a monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-2 receptor, indicating that the T-CLL cells were partially activated already in vivo. After culture in vitro all proliferating T-CLL cells expressed HLA-DR and Tac antigens. The fresh T-CLL cells were found to be defective in cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) generated in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (LDCC). In addition they failed to exhibit natural killer (NK) cell activity against targets that are usually very susceptible to lysis, such as K562, but were able to kill two tumor-derived cell lines, the melanoma NKI-4 and the neuroblastoma CHP-100. The same pattern of selective killing was observed using the proliferating T-CLL cells as effectors, or cloned T-CLL cultures obtained from them by limiting dilution procedures.

In experiments with human breast cancer patients' leukocytes, leukocyte inhibitory factor (LIF) was produced by 32-50% of these patients in response to the mouse-derived MTV or to three different MTV preparations obtained after passage through feline kidney cells. A significant proportion (31-54%) of benign breast disease patients also reacted with both the mouse-derived and feline-derived MTV preparations. Patients with both malignant and benign breast disease, however, had a significantly different (P less than .05) pattern of reactivity to mouse- and feline-derived MTV preparations from that observed with normal donors. Finally, some LIF activity was also observed (but not statistically significant with the use of nonparametric analysis methods) when feline leukemia virus was used as antigen with these patients.

Using a series of ecotropic and nonecotropic murine leukemia virus hybridization probes, we showed that the unintegrated viral genomes are structurally analogous to those of recombinant mink cell focus-forming viruses that appear as proviruses in leukemic AKR thymocytes, suggesting that these free viral DNAs are the direct precursors to the leukemia-specific proviruses. The mosaic of ecotropic and nonecotropic sequences within these unintegrated viral DNAs varies from one preleukemic thymus to another but often appears structurally homogeneous within individual thymuses, indicating that often each thymus was being infected by a unique mink cell focus-forming virus. Analysis of high-molecular-weight DNA shows that recombinant proviruses reside in the chromosomal DNA of thymocytes within the preleukemic thymus, with the number rising to an average of several copies per thymocyte, but we do not detect any preferred integration sites.

Polar solvents including dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, and monomethylformamide have proven to be good inducers of maturational events in murine and human cancer cells. Moreover, several laboratories have demonstrated that polar solvents inhibit the growth of human tumor xenografts in nude mice. These findings have resulted in the entry of monomethylformamide into phase I clinical trials in America and Europe. Preclinical work further suggests that polar solvents may be useful agents in combination with conventional treatment modalities. The use of drugs such as monomethylformamide that can convert neoplastic cells to benign cells rather than kill the tumor cells represents an important conceptual departure from standard cytotoxic chemotherapy. The use of maturational-agent therapy should be considered as an important new development in the design of cancer treatment protocols.","['CA 23225/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26218/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,116,,,,,

A simplified technique of recognizing early cures is described by calculating the probability that an interruption in an exponential failure slope occurred by chance. Examples of cures of acute myelocytic leukemia, of superior chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease in young adults, and of superior adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer are given. The interaction of surgery with chemotherapy is illustrated in pure form in acute myelocytic leukemia and in ovarian cancer. Curative chemotherapy is closer at hand than is generally believed.

In the present study we have examined de novo human monocyte-mediated tumor cytotoxicity and that induced by the agent 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Cytolytic function was analyzed by reference to the release of [111In] oxine from two prelabeled tumor cell lines, K562 and U937, in a 16-hr assay in the presence of serum to more closely mimic in vivo circumstances. Observed cytolysis was clearly related to TPA concentration and effector cell number. Maximal cytolysis was obtained with TPA at 5 ng/ml, at which specific releases were 43% +/- 6 and 18% +/- 5 (mean +/- 1 SEM) at an effector cell to target cell (E:T) ratio of 2.5:1 and 65% +/- 6, and 41% +/- 12 at an E:T ratio of 20:1, for K562 and U937, respectively. In contrast, unstimulated monocytes expressed minimal cytolytic activity, or at best a low cytotoxic effect at high cellular ratios. When TPA-stimulated monocyte-mediated cytolysis was examined, catalase (2750 U/ml) inhibited K562 and U937 cytolysis by 92% and 84%, respectively; superoxide dismutase (300 U/ml) only inhibited cytotoxicity by 17% and 24%, respectively, implicating a central role of H2O2 rather than superoxide ions. Sodium azide (1 mM), an inhibitor of myeloperoxidase, did not diminish cytolysis; in contrast, it increased K562 and U937 cytolysis by 34% and 57%. This increased cytotoxicity was observed for K562 at low levels of cytotoxicity. These data tend to dismiss an essential role of the H2O2-halide-myeloperoxidase pathway of cytolysis. The OH scavengers, histidine (20 mM) and ethanol (40 mM), did not affect K562 killing; mannitol (50 mM), another OH scavenger, had only a slight inhibitory effect (23%). Finally, H2O2 generated by a glucose-glucose oxidase system directly mediated K562 killing and, to a lesser extent, U937 lysis. These results point strongly towards the role of: 1) a myeloperoxidase-independent mechanism of cytotoxicity, with 2) H2O2 as a key mediator of the cytolytic mechanism, and 3) a limited role of O2.- in synergy with H2O2 in the cytolytic activity of monocytes, and suggest that significant cytolytic function requires an inductive event.",['CA 28166/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Mice with SLE-like GVHD do not produce antibodies to a number of non-self and self antigens. This finding is inconsistent with the widely accepted view that the (auto)-antibody formation in SLE is polyclonal in the sense that B cells are triggered at random, i.e., irrespective of their specificity. In the present study, therefore, we performed a systematic study of the kinetics of total IgM- and IgG-secreting splenic B cells and tested their specificities. The total IgM-secreting B cell population was increased only in the first week after the initiation of SLE-like GVHD; it seemed to reflect a random, but self-limited, polyclonal B cell stimulation. In contrast, the total number of IgG-secreting cells in the GVH F1 mice was increased to a much higher extent than that of the IgM-secreting cells and remained increased. At no time during GVHD was there an increase in the number of plaque-forming cells (PFC) spontaneously secreting IgG antibodies to non-self antigens. The GVH reaction (GVHR) did, however, lead to the appearance of PFC that secreted IgG antibodies to DNA. Similarly, the GVH F1 mice showed high serum titers of antibodies to self antigens characteristic of SLE and to endogenous viruses, but during the entire observation period they failed to develop serum antibodies to non-self antigens and insulin. Hence, the enhanced production of Ig, especially that of IgG, that occurs in SLE-like GVHD is not a random process, because it requires the presence of antigen, or signal 1. The data support our hypothesis that only certain kinds of self antigen, such as DNA and cell membrane epitopes, can cross-link the Ig receptors on the corresponding B cells and thus provide an adequate signal 1. Given the increase in help, or signal 2, in chronic GVHD, only the B cell clones that simultaneously receive an adequate signal 1 seem to be driven into clonal proliferation and IgG secretion.",,,,,,,,,

Soluble phorbol diester receptors from HL-60 cells were obtained from the cytosolic fraction and from the particulate fraction by either divalent ion chelation or detergent extraction. The partially purified soluble phorbol diester receptors required exogenous Ca2+ and phospholipid for maximal binding and displayed a dissociation constant (KD) of 8.1 nM for [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Phorbol diester analogues inhibited [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding in a stereospecific manner consistent with their biologic potency. The soluble phorbol diester receptors prepared by all three methods copurified in a constant ratio with the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C through ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE ion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. Partially purified protein kinase C was directly activated by the phorbol diesters even in the absence of exogenous Ca2+. The ability of a series of phorbol analogues to activate the kinase correlated with their known activity as inducers of cell differentiation. In addition, phorbol diester stimulation altered the phosphate acceptor substrate profile of protein kinase C, at least in part, by alteration of the Michaelis constant (Km). These data suggest that protein kinase C is the phorbol diester receptor and that phorbol diester-induced macrophage maturation of HL-60 cells may be mediated by activation of intracellular protein kinase C.","['AI 18308/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI 5T32 CA09307-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC425036,,,,,,,

For instance, an increase in 2-5A synthetase activity has been described during dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)-induced erythroid differentiation of Friend leukemia cells (FLC). 2-5A synthetase has been measured in two Friend leukemia cell sublines by various techniques including a radioimmunoassay of its products which would detect 10(-16) mol of 2-5A cores. Although cells of both sublines fully differentiate (as measured by benzidine staining), only in one subline was there an increase in 2-5A synthetase activity upon treatment with Me2SO. Hexamethylenebisacetamide, another potent agent of differentiation in this system, did not increase 2-5A synthetase activity in either of these two sublines. An IFN-resistant FLC variant differentiated normally upon treatment with Me2SO or hexamethylenebisacetamide while it was noninducible for 2-5A synthetase activity by exogenous IFN or by the inducers themselves. A similar situation has been observed with regard to the level of phosphorylation of the IFN-induced Mr = 67,000 protein band. In addition, treatment of IFN-sensitive and resistant FLC sublines with mouse alpha beta IFN antiserum did not affect differentiation. Even though we have duplicated previous findings on the increase of 2-5A synthetase activity in Me2SO-induced FLC, the lack of any such increase with other inducers or other sublines indicates that there is no causal relationship between the enzyme activation and FLC differentiation.",,,,,,,,,

Changes in the cell cycle, as determined by flow-cytometry, were of similar character in both LY-R and LY-S cells, within 12 h after irradiation, whereas the effect of treatment on survival differed: only LY-S cells were radiosensitized by benzamide; both LY strains were sensitized by caffeine, but to different extents.

We now can be fairly certain that some of those mouse genes are the DNA life phase of a class of retrovirus known as murine leukemia virus. These MuLV, although related in sequence to each other, are a collection of viruses that show diverse patterns of host range and tissue tropisms. The host-range properties of MuLV serve as means of classifying them into related families known as ecotropic, xenotropic, and amphotropic, and are probably dictated by determinants on gp70. The preferential abilities to replicate in different tissues, on the other hand, may be dictated by the controlling sequences located at the 3' end of the genome, known as U3. MuLV genomes are located at many different sites in the mouse genome. The viral genomes found at those sites can be induced to be expressed with different efficiencies spontaneously in vivo, by chemicals in vitro, or by DNA transfection. Certain MuLV genomes can also interact to increase expression perhaps by recombination or trans complementation. Although the molecular mechanisms that explain these phenomena are not yet clear, the phenomenon of differential expression has important pathological consequences, particularly in the development of lymphoma. The complex process by which endogenous MuLV induce leukemia appears to involve the expression and interaction of multiple MuLV genomes. It seems apparent that expression of an MCF-like gp70 is an invariant aspect of this process, and that observation suggests that this molecule, like the SFFV gp52, may indeed serve to stimulate cell proliferation. The most common means of expressing such a molecule at elevated levels appears to involve recombining it into an ecotropic genome that replicates with high efficiency. Thus, the viral requirements for leukemogenesis may depend on both efficient and perhaps tissue tropic replication as well as on the expression of a particular gp70.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",['CA-22443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,189,,,,,

The patient had had no known contact with swine, and the source of infection could not be determined. Only five possible secondary cases could be detected by retrospective investigation of 62 contacts, and there was no evidence of spread to the general community.

After induction with HMBA, M11-X cells produced 500 copies per cell of correctly initiated, processed, and terminated human beta-globin mRNA; authentic human beta-globin chains were also produced at a low level. Despite the presence of normally arranged human gamma-globin genes, no gamma-globin mRNA could be detected after HMBA induction. However, cytosine residues near the gamma-globin gene promoters are completely methylated in these cells, suggesting that the gamma-globin genes may be repressed in part by DNA methylation.

These cell lines have been used to identify surface antigens unique to EBV, with the expectation that such determinants might be related to the antigenic target responsible for EBV-specific immunosurveillance. Antisera prepared in rabbits immunized with either whole cells or purified plasma membranes were used in immunoblot experiments to analyze antigenic differences resulting from expression of the resident EBV genome. Unexpectedly, an increase in polypeptides of 32 and 70 kilodaltons was consistently observed in the EBV-converted Ramos lines. In contrast, these antigens were not expressed in BJAB or in its EBV-converted lines. These data suggested that p32 and gp70 might be murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-coded antigens because Ramos, but not BJAB, had been passaged in athymic nude mice during establishment of this cell line. This conclusion was confirmed by using antisera specific for MuLV p30 and gp70. Retroviral antigens were expressed constitutively at low levels in Ramos. Quantitative immunoblotting showed that EBV conversion of Ramos amplified the expression of MuLV proteins 3- to 5-fold. The molecular mechanism responsible for the enhanced expression is unknown. The biological relevance of this phenomenon is also not clear, but the interaction between a DNA and a RNA tumor virus in a Burkitt lymphoma line that carries both viruses may have important biological consequences in relation to retrovirus latency and tumor induction. These results also show that caution must be used when ascribing ""uniqueness"" to EBV-determined antigens, particularly in the Ramos lines. This warning extends also to the use of Ramos cell lines as immunogens, because immunization of rabbits elicited antibodies that recognized proteins of the same size as the retroviral antigens.",['CA 17327/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC344604,,,,,,,

A role of retroviruses in human leukemogenesis is suggested by epidemiological observations and by the isolation of such viruses from several human T-cell leukemias and lymphomas (human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus or HTLV) as well as by biochemical association of retroviral markers with human leukemias. A role of HTLV has been suggested also in a human immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In view of the well known role of many factors in carcinogenesis the concept of carcinogenesis as a multistep process as well as the concept of cocarcinogenesis and the role of cofactors other than viruses, such as radiation and chemicals, aging, hormones, graft vs host reaction, environmental factors etc., will have to be carefully considered.",,,,160,,,,,

The mechanism(s) regulating virus expression is unknown, but expression is thought to be controlled at the transcriptional level by linkage to cis-acting cellular DNA sequences or DNA methylation or both. To begin to differentiate between these different control mechanisms, we molecularly cloned two endogenous ecotropic proviruses, Emv-3 and Emv-13, complete with flanking cellular DNA sequences. Both proviruses are poorly expressed in vivo and in vitro, although they appear to be structurally nondefective by restriction enzyme analysis. Cloned DNAs of both proviruses were poorly infectious in DNA transfection experiments, suggesting that methylation may not regulate the expression of these genes in vivo. Removal of their flanking cellular sequences did not increase their infectivity. However, these DNAs were highly infectious when mixed together, indicating that both proviruses carry mutations, that inhibit their expression and belong to different complementation groups. Marker rescue experiments suggested that Emv-3 is defective in the gag region and Emv-13 is defective in p15E-U3. The infectivity of Emv-3, but not of Emv-13, DNA was increased by the addition of AKR xenotropic murine leukemia virus DNA, consistent with known regions of homology between ecotropic and xenotropic proviruses. Recombination between defective endogenous viruses also appears to occur in vivo, suggesting that this may be a common mechanism controlling endogenous murine leukemia virus expression.","['CA-31102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32324/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC255484,,,,,,,

As reported previously (M. Ruta and D. Kabat, J. Virol. 35:844-853, 1980), the replication-defective R-SFFV encodes a membrane glycoprotein with an apparent Mr of 54,000 (gp54) which is structurally and immunologically related to the membrane envelope glycoproteins of dual-tropic murine leukemia viruses. Mutant R-SFFV clones 3-25 and 4-3 encode abnormally sized gp54-related glycoproteins with apparent Mrs of 52,000 (gp52) and 45,000 (gp45), respectively. Northern and Southern blot analyses of the mutant R-SFFV nucleic acids indicated that an insertion has occurred in the 3-25 env gene and that a deletion has occurred in the 4-3 env gene. Furthermore, restriction endonuclease analyses and comparisons of the fragmentation patterns of the wild-type and mutant glycoproteins generated by partial proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease indicated that the mutations affect nonoverlapping domains of the envelope glycoprotein (amino-terminal fragment affected in 3-25 glycoprotein and carboxyl-terminal fragment affected in 4-3 glycoprotein). Glycosylation inhibition studies indicated that the reduced size of gp52 is caused at least partly by loss of an asparagine-linked oligosaccharide. In addition, these mutant viruses have dramatically reduced leukemogenicities compared with wild-type R-SFFV.

In uninduced MELC, a low level of alpha 1-globin, coding-strand-specific transcription is detectable. Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA)-mediated MELC differentiation is associated with a 10 to 20-fold increase in the rate of alpha 1-globin gene transcription. In induced MELC, alpha 1-globin gene transcription initiated predominantly near the cap site, occurs only off the coding strand, and might terminate, or attenuate, in a region 50 to 250 base-pairs 3' of the polyadenylation site. Before transcriptional activation of the gene, chromatin surrounding the gene displays overlapping DNase I and S1 nuclease sensitive sites, which map to a region 100 to 200 base-pairs 5' of the cap site. After induction, the nuclease sensitivity of these pre-established, overlapping sites increases. In addition, induction generates novel, non-overlapping DNase I and S1 nuclease sensitive sites, which map to regions centered 300 base-pairs 5', and approximately coincident with the cap site, respectively. We compared the time-course of alpha 1-globin transcriptional activation to the chromatin structure changes. A twofold increase in gene transcription is detected within two cell cycles (approximately 24 hours) of exposure of cells synchronized in the G1/early S-phase to inducer. Transcription rates continue to increase for at least 48 hours in MELC cultured with HMBA (the latest time assayed). Chromatin structure changes appear nearly complete after two cell cycles.","['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P0 1 CA-3-768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The drug bromodeoxyuridine appeared to have differential effects on virus expression, amplifying xenotropic virus induction but inhibiting the spontaneous production of the ecotropic virus in AKR cultures and of the defective virus in NFS/N cells. Infecting stimulated BALB/c or AKR cultures with Friend leukaemia virus resulted in the production of ecotropic-xenotropic pseudotype viruses, indicating that the infecting ecotropic virus replicates in the cells in which xenotropic virus is induced. No pseudotypes or recombinants were observed following infection of spleen cells releasing defective viruses. Friend leukaemia virus and xenotropic virus with an ecotropic envelope replicated equally well in stimulated lymphocytes from the different strains examined.

Differences in the Mr of tissue-associated gp70s were confirmed by double-label co-electrophoresis studies. In addition, a high degree of primary structural pleomorphism among tissue-associated gp70s was demonstrated using two-dimensional tryptic peptide fingerprint analysis. These studies showed that most of the conserved peptides of tissue-associated gp70s were also common to xenotropic murine leukaemia virus (MuLV) gp70s. Thus, tissue-associated gp70s are probably encoded by endogenous xenotropic MuLV env genes or gene fragments. Tissue-associated gp70s also showed a very high level of primary structural pleomorphism. These phenomena were observed for gp70s derived from the tissues of several strains of mice. Tissue-associated gp70 pleomorphism may arise as a consequence of at least two simultaneously operating mechanisms. First, the expression of pleomorphic forms of gp70s on murine tissues may be regulated by mechanisms that also determine the differentiated state of the tissues. Second, endogenous xenotropic env genes may be modified by recombinational or mutational events among these genes, or among cellular genes that regulate the expression of endogenous proviral genes.",['CA 25789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

We investigated differentiation by monitoring 1,25(OH)2D3-exposed HL-60 cells for phagocytic activity, ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium, binding of the chemotaxin N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-[3H]phenylalanine, development of nonspecific acid esterase activity, and morphological maturation of Wright-Giemsa-stained cells. 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations as low as 10(-10) M caused significant development of phagocytosis, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, and the emergence of differentiated myeloid cells that had morphological characteristics of both metamyelocytes and monocytes. These cells were conclusively identified as monocytes/macrophages based upon their adherence to the plastic flasks and their content of the macrophage-characteristic nonspecific acid esterase enzyme. The estimated ED50 for 1,25(OH)2D3-induced differentiation based upon nitroblue tetrazolium reduction and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-[3H]phenylalanine binding was 5.7 X 10(-9) M. HL-60 cells exhibited a complex growth response with various levels of 1,25(OH)2D3: less than or equal to 10(-10) M had no detectable effect, 10(-9) M stimulated growth, and greater than or equal to 10(-8) M sharply inhibited proliferation. We also detected and quantitated the specific receptor for 1,25(OH)2D3 in HL-60 and HL-60 Blast, a sub-clone resistant to the growth and differentiation effects of 1,25(OH)2D3. The receptor in both lines was characterized as a DNA-binding protein that migrated at 3.3S on high-salt sucrose gradients. Unequivocal identification was provided by selective dissociation of the 1,25(OH)2D3-receptor complex with the mercurial reagent, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid, and by a shift in its sedimentation position upon complexing with anti-receptor monoclonal antibody. On the basis of labeling of whole cells with 1,25(OH)2[3H]D3 in culture, we found that HL-60 contains approximately 4,000 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor molecules per cell, while the nonresponsive HL-60 Blast is endowed with approximately 8% of that number. The concentration of 1,25(OH)2D3 (5 X 10(-9) M) in complete culture medium, which facilitates the saturation of receptors in HL-60 cells, is virtually identical to the ED50 for the sterol's induction of differentiation. This correspondence, plus the resistance of the relatively receptor-poor HL-60 Blast, indicates that 1,25(OH)2D3-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells to monocytes/macrophages is occurring via receptor-mediated events.","['AM-15781/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-30290/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-32313/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2113084,,,,,,,

The intact conjugate produced potent cytotoxic effects on human leukemia CEM cells, (ID50 = 3 X 10(-11) M), while a 10,000-fold higher concentration of uncoupled transferrin plus A chain was required for comparable action. TF-A chain cytotoxicity was totally blocked by native transferrin or by antibodies directed against ricin A chain and human transferrin. CEM cells gradually acclimated to grow in the presence of TF-A chain displayed 1000-fold resistance to the conjugate while their sensitivity to whole ricin was undiminished. The level of transferrin receptor expressed by these cells was 1/20 the amount present on the parent line and their capacity to bind human transferrin was below the limits of detectability using fluorescent probes. This receptor-deficient cell line was unresponsive to the low levels of transferrin which stimulated proliferation of control CEM cells, but their growth was supported by greatly elevated concentrations of ligand. Receptor variant CEM cells, together with the specific TF-A chain toxin, will be useful for studying the mechanisms for transmembrane delivery of both Fe3+ and ricin A chain into cells and will aid in understanding the growth regulatory functions of the receptor-ligand interaction.",['CA 29039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Contrary to expectation, bm14 mice showed slightly less tumors than wildtype B6 mice. Moreover, all bm14 mice that developed a tumor were able to reject this tumor, even after injection of the highest virus dose tested. From the spleen cells of bm14 mice that had rejected tumors, no secondary in vitro CTL responses could be generated, in contrast to strong CTL responses generated from B6 spleen cells. Although bm14 mice were unable to generate virus-specific CTL, they showed normal antibody and T-cell proliferative responses against Moloney virus, suggesting an intact T-helper-cell function. It is concluded that in bm14 mice, under the conditions tested, virus-specific CTL are not generated despite excellent tumor immunity. Therefore, this CTL response is not necessary for protection against M-MSV-induced tumors. Protection is likely to be mediated by a normal T-cell proliferative response.",,,,,,,,,

Cells infected with animal type-C retroviruses, e.g., gibbon ape leukemia virus, simian sarcoma virus, feline leukemia virus, and Gross murine leukemia virus, were completely negative for HTLVp19 expression. Other human T cells not producing HTLV, including HUT78 and HSB2-0, immature or pre-T cells (Molt-3) derived from leukemia patients, and fresh peripheral blood T cells from healthy persons, were also negative. In addition, B cells including Rob-B, IM-9, Raji, and BT-1 did not react with the monoclonal antibody to HTLV p19. In the light of the presence of HTLV p19 in the periphery of acetone-fixed HTLV-producing cells as shown by IFM, it seems most likely that HTLV p19 is an internal antigen of HTLV with part of its structure protruding out of the viral and cell membrane. The monoclonal antibody to HTLV p19 did not lyse HTLV-producing cells in the presence of complement, as expected, because the antibody is an IgG1. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity was also studied by the 51Cr-release assay. No cytotoxicity was observed. Although HTLV p19 does not contribute to the destruction of malignant T cells for treatment and/or virions for prophylaxis, this protein is an important marker for diagnosis of HTLV infection. The patterns of HTLV p19 expression described above were exactly the same for American HTLV-producing HUT 102 (B2 clone), for strain A cells and for Japanese HTLV-producing MT-2 cells. These results further substantiate the close relationship of the Japanese and American HTLV isolates.",,,,,,,,,

One group of amosite rats also received chrysotile asbestos via gavage during lactation. Group sizes varied from 100 to 250 animals. The offspring from mothers exposed to tremolite or amosite asbestos were smaller at weaning than those from untreated mothers and remained smaller throughout their life.

DMH exposure reduced survival by approximately one year, although the amosite plus DMH groups survived slightly better than the DMH alone groups.

Significant increases (p less than 0.05) in the rates of C-cell carcinomas of the thyroid and monocytic (mononuclear cell) leukemia in male rats were observed in amosite-exposed groups. However, the biological significance of the C-cell carcinomas in relation to amosite asbestos exposure is discounted because of a lack of significance when C-cell adenomas and carcinomas were combined and the positive effect was not observed in the amosite plus preweaning gavage group. The biological significance of an increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia is questionable, because of a lack of statistical significance in the amosite group when evaluated using life table analysis, lack of significance when compared to the tremolite control group, and the fact that no toxic or neoplastic lesions were observed in the target organs, i.e., gastrointestinal tract and mesothelium.

Serum myeloperoxidase was, on average, significantly higher in children than in adults (p = 0.01), whereas serum lactoferrin and serum lysozyme were equal to those of adults.

Based on the assumption that serum lactoferrin and serum myeloperoxidase reflect turnover and activity of neutrophil granulocytes, the findings could suggest reduction in these respects and could be one contributing factor to the high infection propensity of these children.

To achieve this K562 cells which were obtained from the 34-36% interface of discontinuous Percoll gradients and purified human NK cells (LGL) which were obtained from the (43-45% Percoll) interface were employed. Using a Ca2+ pulse method and the separation of NK-K562 conjugates with EDTA and rapid centrifugation on Percoll gradients at 4 degrees C we could physically isolate the lethally hit K562 cells from the LGL allowing the study of the events leading to their subsequent lysis. Lysis of ""purified"" lethally hit K562 cells occurred in the absence of Ca2+ or Mg2+ and was blocked by reduced temperature (4 degrees C), or by the protease enzyme trypsin. When lethally hit targets were held at 4 degrees C (to block lysis) then rewarmed to 37 degrees C lysis ensued but with a rate slower than that of control cells not held at 4 degrees C.

The effects of PDEs on cells are apparently mediated by specific cellular receptors for these ligands. The purpose of this study was to determine if the different phenotypic responses of cells of different human leukemia cell lines were due to differences in the PDE receptors in these cells. All cells of the different lines studied [HL-60 (promyelocytic), HL-60Bll (undifferentiated blastic), U-937 (monoblastic), H-SB2 (T-lymphoblastoid), and SB (B-lymphoblastoid) bound the [20-3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate in a specific manner. The ligand bound to the cells rapidly, reaching a maximum by 10 to 20 min at 37 degrees or by 60 min at 4 degrees. The bound [20-3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate could be fully dissociated from the cells by adding unlabeled phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate; the kinetics of this dissociation paralleled association kinetics. Scatchard analysis of the binding data, derived from experiments done at 4 degrees, revealed linear plots, indicating, most likely, that only single classes of receptors existed on all of these lines. The dissociation constants for binding were all comparable (46 to 152 nM), and the calculated numbers of binding sites were comparable (4.8 to 8.1 X 10(5)/cell). None of the cells could degrade [20-3H]phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate or [20-3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate as determined by thin-layer chromatographic analysis of cells or supernatants of the cell cultures. PDEs inhibited the proliferation of U-937 and HL-60 cells but not that of the HL-60Bll, SB, or H-SB2 cells. The incorporation of tritiated thymidine into HL-60 cells (but not HL-60Bll cells) was dramatically inhibited by various PDEs, and the potency in causing this inhibition paralleled that known for the potency of the phorbol analogues to cause tumor promotion in vivo or to elicit other in vitro responses from hematopoietic cells. [20-3H]Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate caused the HL-60 and U-937 cells to adhere to the plastic, spread, and develop vacuoles, but the other cells displayed no changes. These results suggest that the differing phenotypic responses to PDEs are most likely related to postreceptor factors.","['11265/PHS HHS/United States', '27070/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

There is evidence that DNA may be the target of action because VP-16 causes single-strand and double-strand breaks in DNA and produces cytotoxicity over a similar dose range. We have hypothesized that an enzyme system, such as dehydrogenase, catalyzes an oxidation-reduction reaction involving the pendant phenolic group which forms an active metabolite that causes the DNA damage and cytotoxicity. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the effect of disulfiram, an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, and its metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate, on VP-16-induced DNA damage in L1210 cells. Using the alkaline elution technique to assay DNA damage, we found that disulfiram and diethyldithiocerbamate inhibited VP-16-induced single-strand breaks. Both compounds were also capable of significantly reducing VP-16-induced cytotoxicity. Oxalic acid, pyrophosphate, and malonic acid, competitive inhibitors of succinate dehydrogenase, and the naturally occurring dehydrogenase substrates, succinic acid, beta-glycerophosphate, and isocitric acid, also blocked the effects of VP-16. Free-radical scavengers were also studied. While sodium benzoate was particularly effective in preventing drug-induced DNA damage and cytotoxicity, a number of other scavengers were not. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that VP-16 is activated by an enzyme such as a dehydrogenase which transforms it into an active intermediate resulting in DNA damage and, consequently, cell death.",['RCDA CA-00537/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Within observation limits, the characteristics of feline leukemia virus-infected and normal cat T-cells were similar.

Specific receptors for the phorbol diesters have been demonstrated on numerous different cells. This study was designed to characterize the receptors for phorbol diesters on leukemia cells freshly isolated from patients with different kinds of leukemia and to determine if differences in binding characteristics for tritium-labeled phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (3H-PDBu) accounted for the different cellular responses elicited in vitro by phorbol diesters. Cells from 26 patients with different kinds of leukemia were studied. PDBu or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) caused cells from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), acute promyelocytic (APML), acute myelomonocytic (AMML), acute monocytic (AMoL), acute erythroleukemia (AEL), chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) in blast crisis (myeloid), acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL), and hairy cell leukemia (HCL) (n = 15) to adhere to plastic and spread. However, they caused no adherence or spreading and only slight aggregation of cells from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or CML-blast crisis (lymphoid) (n = 11). All leukemia cells studied, irrespective of cellular type, displayed specific receptors for 3H-PDBu. The time courses for binding by all leukemia types were similar, with peak binding at 5-10 min at 37 degrees C and 120 min at 4 degrees C. The binding affinities were similar for patients with ALL (96 +/- 32 nM, n = 4), CLL (126 +/- 32 nM, n = 6), and acute nonlymphoid leukemia (73 +/- 14 nM, n = 11). Likewise, the numbers of specific binding sites/cell were comparable for the patients with ALL (6.2 +/- 1.3 X 10(5) sites/cell, n = 4), CLL (5.0 +/- 2.0 X 10(5) sites/cell, n = 6), and acute nonlymphoid leukemia (4.4 +/- 1.9 X 10(5) sites/cell, n = 11). Thus, the differing responses to phorbol diesters of various types of freshly isolated leukemia cells appear to be due to differences other than initial ligand-receptor binding.",['27070/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

The specificities of antibodies in cat FOCMA-typing sera and the nature of the LSA antigens recognized were investigated in the present study. FOCMA sera obtained from viremic cats were separable into at least two classes : those which contained antibodies against the envelope glycoprotein (gp70) of subgroup C FeLV and those which did not contain antibodies against any subgroup of FeLV. The first class of sera could be further subdivided into three groups: those whose FOCMA reactivity could be completely absorbed, partially absorbed, or not absorbed by FeLV-C antigens. The second class of sera could be further subdivided into two groups: those whose FOCMA reactivity could be partially absorbed and those whose activity could not be absorbed by FeLV-C. The results indicate that the FOCMA reactivity exhibited by some viremic cat sera can be partially, if not entirely, attributed to antibodies not crossreactive with FeLV virion antigens. A consistent property of all FOCMA sera in this study is the ability to bind to 70-kDa proteins on the surface of LSA cells. Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease partial digest maps of 70-kDa proteins purified from 12 primary feline LSAs (five FeLV positive and seven FeLV negative) all showed 18-, 14-, and 10-kDa fragments. V8 maps of FeLV-C gp70 showed similarly sized fragments while the maps of the RD114, FeLV-A, and FeLV-B gp70s were distinct. However, in a subgroup-specific radioimmunoassay for FeLV-C gp70-related antigens, the LSA 70-kDa proteins were found to be serologically related to, but distinct from, FeLV-C gp70. The results on the antigenic variations among LSA 70-kDa proteins and the antibodies which bind them are entirely consistent with previous studies indicating heterogeneity among FOCMA determinants.",,,,,,,,,

Fortunately, considerable knowledge was available: research in immunology over the last two decades had provided the technological advances and basic information about cell-mediated immunity that were necessary for identification of the syndrome. Without this knowledge base, immune suppression would not have been recognized as the common link among AIDS patients manifesting a variety of infections and unusual neoplasms. Similarly, research on infectious diseases, and in particular on the role of viruses as etiologic agents, has had an important bearing on understanding of AIDS. The epidemiologic data to date indicate that an infectious agent most likely is involved and that transmission of the disease requires intimate contact and perhaps some passage of blood. Among the candidates for viral agents are Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human T-cell leukemia virus. All have been isolated from the cells of AIDS victims, but whether they are etiologic agents or opportunistic pathogens remains unresolved. Knowledge gained from the study of any of these viruses will contribute to understanding of AIDS, and vice versa. In this paper, we have attempted to show the integral relationship between specific research on AIDS and the ongoing research effort in related disciplines. It is important to recognize that effective research is the result of careful consideration of which questions can and should be addressed and the development of innovative approaches to gain answers to those questions. Research on AIDS is proceeding as rapidly as it is only because of the solid foundations that have been developed in the areas of immunology and virology. It is this base of research that ultimately will provide the rationale and the tools for solving new problems.",,PMC1424493,,23,,,,,

Electrophoretic patterns of cell surface proteins and glycoproteins of CLL cells were markedly different from those of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) cells which possessed a characteristic major cell surface glycoprotein gp95 (with relative molecular weight of 95-105k). This glycoprotein was markedly decreased or absent on examined CLL cells. Electrophoretic glycoprotein patterns revealed variations in the expression of several glycoproteins, as well as in the electrophoretic mobility of major glycoprotein gp95 also within the examined groups, particularly in acute myeloblastic leukemia.",,,,,,,,,

An integrated mouse VL30 gene was found to contain identical 601-base-pair long terminal repeats (LTRs) which were themselves terminated in short inverted repeats. The entire VL30 gene was flanked by a 4-base-pair direct repeat of cellular DNA. Thus, VL30 genes are structurally analogous to integrated forms of retrovirus proviruses and certain other classes of mobile genetic elements. The LTR sequence was found to contain putative promoter and polyadenylation signals and generally exhibited little sequence homology to murine leukemia virus proviral LTRs. Certain short regions of sequence conservation, however, were evident, including the inverted terminal repeat, LTR-adjacent regions corresponding to origins of murine leukemia virus proviral DNA synthesis, and a 36-base-pair direct repeat bearing homology to the 72-base-pair direct repeat (enhancer sequence) of the murine leukemia virus-related Moloney sarcoma virus. Upon mitogenic stimulation of quiescent cells with epidermal growth factor and insulin, a major 5.5-kilobase VL30-specific RNA complementary to both LTR and non-LTR sequences was rapidly induced.

These SFFV-TK and SFFV deletion vectors were analyzed for expression of tk and gp55 after DNA-mediated gene transfer. In addition, virus rescued by cotransfection of these vectors with Moloney murine leukemia virus was analyzed for infectious TK-transducing virus, gp55 expression, and erythroleukemia-inducing ability. The experiments demonstrated that deletions or insertions within the intron for the gp55 env gene can interfere with expression of gp55 after both DNA-mediated gene transfer and virus infection. In contrast, the gene transfer efficiency of the tk gene was unaffected in the SFFV-TK vectors, and high-titer infectious TK virus could be recovered. Revertant viruses capable of inducing erythroleukemia and expressing gp55 were generated after cotransfection of the SFFV-TK vectors with murine leukemia virus.

Cotransfection into mouse cells of chimeric plasmids carrying a murine retrovirus 5' long terminal repeat and either the thymidine kinase (tk) gene of herpesvirus or the dominant selectable bacterial gene for neomycin resistance (neo), along with a clone of Moloney murine leukemia virus, results in the generation of infectious thymidine kinase or neomycin-resistant viruses. Expression of the selectable marker in these viruses can be regulated by the homologous transcriptional promoter of the gene, by the promoter contained within the Friend spleen focus-forming virus long terminal repeat, or by the simian virus 40 early region promoter. In all cases, the rescued viruses appeared to arise by recombination in vivo with Moloney murine leukemia virus sequences, resulting in the acquisition of the Moloney 3' long terminal repeat and variable amounts of the 3' adjacent Moloney genome. In two of the thymidine kinase constructs where tk was inserted 200 base pairs downstream from the long terminal repeat, the rescued viruses acquired a large part of the murine leukemia virus genome, including the region involved in packaging genomic RNA into virions. The generation of infectious neomycin-resistant virus is associated with deletions of simian virus 40 splicing and polyadenylation sequences. These results demonstrate that nonhomologous recombination and deletion events can take place in animal cells, resulting in the acquisition or removal of cis-acting sequences required for, or inhibitory to, retrovirus infectivity.",,PMC370089,,,,,,,

Normal morphology, failure to grow in agar, and the requirement of hormones for optimal growth were all restored after shifting to the temperature nonpermissive for transformation (39 degrees C), though the typical differentiated functions remained blocked. Infection with a leukemia helper virus clone (Moloney or Kirsten murine leukemia virus) did not lead to the loss of the differentiated phenotype of rat epithelial thyroid cells, thus demonstrating that the loss of the differentiated phenotype is caused by the sarcoma virus component.

As a result, significantly low lactoferrin-scores were frequently observed in acute leukaemias and the acute phase of chronic leukaemias. Of 35 cases with leukaemias, lactoferrin-negative polymorphonuclear leucocytes (type 0) were observed in the following cases: eight cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia (8/14), a case of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (1/10) in blast crisis, one of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (1/1), one of acute monocytic leukaemia (1/2), and a case of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (1/2) in a transitional phase to an acute myelomonocytic leukaemia. In two cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia, in which the majority of polymorphonuclear leucocytes were negative for lactoferrin, ultrastructural cytochemical study revealed total lack of specific granules in these polymorphonuclear leucocytes.

By measuring the fluorescence of cells stained at subsaturating concentrations of conjugate it was possible to calculate the average numbers of receptors per cell and the binding affinity by Scatchard analysis. These values (1.9 X 10(5) binding sites/cell, KA 1.2 X 10(9) M-1 for CCRF-CEM during exponential growth and 6.9 X 10(4) binding sites/cell, KA 1.4 X 10(-9) M-1 for PMC-22B) are in close agreement with previously published data obtained using radiolabelled transferrin. The present method, however, allowed the transferrin receptor expression of individual cells within a population to be measured and thus it has been possible to test the hypothesis that transferrin receptor is a marker for cycling cells. Frequency-distribution histograms of transferrin receptor showed a wide range of values for both cell lines during exponential growth. When the extreme ranges were sorted and the cells examined for cellular DNA content it was found that those with the highest transferrin receptor expression were enriched with cells in S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle, whereas those with low transferrin receptor expression were mainly in G1. However, two-parameter-correlated dot plots of transferrin receptor expression versus DNA content showed there was considerable overlap between the ranges of receptor expression for the different cell cycle compartments. Using a stathmokinetic method we have measured the proportion of quiescent cells in fed plateau phase cultures. Transferrin receptor expression was downgraded under these growth conditions but, contrary to expectation, the decline affected the population uniformly, without the emergence of a distinct, transferrin receptor-negative subpopulation corresponding to the increasing proportion of quiescent cells. Thus, although transferrin receptor expression bears some relation to cell cycle phase and reflects the proliferative activity of populations of cells, it is incapable of identifying individual cells which are out of cycle.",,,,,,,,,

ADP-ribosylation of chromatin proteins has been shown to participate in DNA excision repair in all nucleated cells. ADP-ribosylation of chromatin proteins is catalysed by nuclear ADP-ribosyl transferase (ADPRT). This enzyme is entirely dependent on DNA for its activity because it has an absolute requirement for ends or nicks in double-stranded DNA. Exposure of cells to small alkylating agents or to radiation causes a fall in cellular NAD+ levels due to a transient activation of ADPRT and a consequent ADP-ribosylation of chromatin proteins. Inhibitors of ADPRT retard DNA strand-rejoining induced by radiation or by small alkylating agents; such inhibition has at least two biological consequences; a synergistic potentiation of cytotoxicity and an enhancement of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations. No species differences have yet been reported; there are variations between cell types and between different damaging agents. The enzyme inhibitors do not block early steps in DNA repair, and repair synthesis does not require ADPRT activity. DNA damage increases the activity of both DNA polymerase beta and DNA ligase II. The activation of DNA ligase II can be blocked by ADPRT inhibitors; presumably ADPRT activity is required for the activation of DNA ligase II. A plausible molecular explanation for the function of ADPRT in DNA repair is that ADPRT regulates the activity of DNA ligase II, the ""non-replicative"" ligase. In addition to its function in DNA repair, ADPRT is an obligatory requirement in certain categories of cell differentiation. Inhibitors of ADPRT and nicotinamide starvation both reversibly block cell differentiation. We suggest that a similar mechanism to that of DNA repair may be involved because we observe 100 to 300 single-strand DNA breaks during the cytodifferentiation of primary chick myoblasts. These breaks are not due to a general deficiency in DNA repair. I suggest that in certain categories of cell differentiation there are rearrangements or transpositions within the mammalian genome, and that ADP-ribosylation reactions have a general function to be sensitive to DNA breaks and to regulate subsequent DNA ligation in DNA repair, in DNA recombination, in sister chromatid exchanges, in chromosome aberrations, in gene rearrangements, in transpositions and in certain categories of cell differentiation. The relevance of these observations and ideas to cancer is discussed.",,,,25,,,,,

As a consequence of the depletion of NAD+ and ATP pools, cells exhibit a marked impairment in their ability to conduct all energy dependent functions. Thus cells treated with high levels of DNA damaging agents exhibit severe suppression of DNA replication and repair, RNA synthesis and protein synthesis. The use of inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase to prevent the depletion of NAD+ and ATP partially restores the cells' ability to conduct DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. This preservation of the NAD+ and ATP pools accounts for the recent observations that inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) stimulate the level of DNA repair synthesis in cells treated with high levels of DNA damaging agents. We have also examined cells from patients with several of the disorders of DNA repair and have found that cells from patients with Fanconi's anemia have lower than normal NAD+ levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['CA24986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM26463/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09118/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

These observations contribute to other evidence which has failed to confirm a general association of ADP-ribosylation with the DNA synthesis inhibition response.

In a search for possible endogenous ligand(s) for the receptor, we used the human placenta as a source. A factor that can inhibit the binding of [3H]PDBu on different types of cells was purified (133-fold) from an extract of human placenta. This factor, PEBIF ('phorbol ester binding inhibitory factor'), is sensitive to pepsin and resistant to trypsin treatment. It is heat- and acid (pH3)-stable and can be precipitated by 80% ethanol with no loss of activity. PEBIF inhibits binding whether it is added before or after incubation of [3H]PDBu with human amniotic membrane cells (FL). Inhibition occurs at both 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C and is rapid and reversible; it does not require intact cells, since it also occurs with membrane fractions. PEBIF does not act like a binding protein for PDBu, and the kinetics of the inhibition on FL cells is non-competitive. Inhibition was also observed in rat liver cells (IAR 6) and Friend erythroleukaemia cells (FELC). Differentiation of FELC induced by hexamethylene bisacetamide can be inhibited by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) only if TPA-sensitive cells (TS 19-101) are used; no inhibition is observed with TPA-resistant cells (TR 19-9). The same is true of PEBIF. It has been shown that these two clones have about the same number of receptors, with no change of affinity; and the extent of inhibition of PDBu binding by PEBIF was similar in the two clones. Like TPA, PEBIF can increase 2-deoxyglucose uptake in mouse fibroblasts (BALB/3T3 cells). These data suggest that this physiological factor may play a role in the regulation of cell differentiation and/or in the modulation of carcinogenesis.",,,,,,,,,

Since Li+ is a potent inhibitor of myo-inositol-1-phosphatase, the results indicate that phytohemagglutinin induces the hydrolysis of inositol lipids in CCRF-CEM cells. In 32PO4-prelabeled CCRF-CEM cells, phytohemagglutinin induced a breakdown of 28% of [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 40-60 s after the stimulation. The decrease of [32P]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate was found as early as 10 s after the stimulation. This decrease was followed by an increased 32P-labeling of phosphatidic acid. In [2-3H]glycerol-prelabeled CCRF-CEM cells, phytohemagglutinin induced a transient accumulation of [3H]phosphatidic acid and [3H]diacylglycerol. The amount of [3H]phosphatidic acid in the stimulated cells was 3.7-times the control value at 2 min after the stimulation, whereas the amount of [3H]diacylglycerol in the stimulated cells was 1.5-times the control value at 5 min after the stimulation. In [3H8]arachidonate-prelabeled CCRF-CEM cells, phytohemagglutinin induced a transient accumulation of [3H]phosphatidic acid; the amount was 2.5-times the control value at 2 min after the stimulation. Quinacrine (1 mM) caused 41% reduction in the amount of [3H]phosphatidic acid accumulated by the stimulation in [2-3H]glycerol-prelabeled cells. Stimulation in a Ca2+-free saline containing 1 mM EGTA caused 53% reduction in the amount of [3H]phosphatidic acid accumulated by the stimulation.

The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors stimulated DNA repair synthesis after cells were exposed to high concentrations of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (68 and 136 microM) but not after exposure to low concentrations (13.6 and 34 microM). When the L1210 cells were exposed to 136 microM N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase resulted in the rapid depletion of oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels and subsequent depletion of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) pools. After low doses of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (13.6 microM), there were only small decreases in NAD+ and ATP. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors prevented the rapid fall in NAD+ and ATP pools. This preservation of the ATP pool has a permissive effect on energy-dependent functions and accounts for the apparent stimulation of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Thus, the mechanism by which poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors stimulate DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in DNA-damaged cells appears to be mediated by their ability to prevent the drastic depletion of NAD+ pools that occurs in heavily damaged cells, thereby preserving the cells' ability to generate ATP and maintain energy-dependent processes.","['2 P30 CA 16217/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM26463/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

Analysis of EBV-induced transformation and the kinetics of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) induction in leukemic preparations indicated that most leukemic cells were not susceptible to EBV infection but that at least a small subpopulation of leukemic cells could be infected with EBV. Lymphoblastoid cells lines were established after exposure of peripheral blood or splenic cells from HCL patients to B95-8 or QIMR-WIL EBV. Splenic leukemic cell preparations were more sensitive targets for EBV transformation than were peripheral blood cell samples. The newly established cell lines, but not long-established B lines such as Raji, demonstrated high levels of synthesis of p35, (a protein complex expressed abundantly by cells of a subset of HCL patients) and high levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (an enzyme relatively diagnostic for HCL). Lymphoblastoid lines from one patient with HCL expressed lambda light chains and no kappa chains as did the patient's leukemic cells. Virus expression in these lines showed that HCL-derived lines had spontaneous early antigen (EA) and viral capsid antigen (VCA) expression. Transforming EBV could be rescued from HCL-derived cell lines but not from cord blood-derived lines.","['2507 RR05712/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25873/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

The biological properties and RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotide fingerprints of the recovered viruses from tissues of both lymphomatous and paralyzed mice inoculated with MuLV-A were analyzed. These results indicate that serial in vivo passages of MuLV-A in NIH Swiss mice lead to generation of new MuLVs of both amphotropic and ecotropic host ranges. The recovered amphotropic viruses are highly lymphomagenic and are recombinants of MuLV-A-specific oligonucleotides and endogenous mouse sequences. The ecotropic viruses fall into two groups: (1) recombinants of MuLV-A genes and NIH Swiss mouse viral or cellular sequences and (2) new ecotropic viruses with oligonucleotide fingerprints not related to any of the known MuLVs. The naturally occurring ecotropic MuLVs of the wild mice produce both lymphoma and paralysis in NIH Swiss mice. The viruses recovered from in vivo passages are mainly of ecotropic host range although dual-tropic virus activity is occasionally seen in the spleens but not in the brains or spinal cords of the lymphomatous or paralyzed mice. Oligonucleotide fingerprinting of the recovered MuLV-Es from paralyzed mice are identical to the input MuLV-Es, indicating that the parental MuLV-E alone, without recombination, is responsible for the paralytic disease.","['CA16113/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CP8-1032/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

During establishment of these cell lines, it was found that when T-cell lines expressing the ATL-associated retroviral antigen were cocultivated with 8C cat cells, multinucleated syncytia were formed. Retroviral antigen-negative T-cell lines did not induce syncytia. Peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from ATL patients did not express the retroviral antigen before cultivation in vitro but became positive for the retroviral antigen after cultivation for a short period; these retroviral antigen-positive lymphocytes, but not retroviral antigen-negative lymphocytes, induced syncytia upon cocultivation with 8C cells. Peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia of T-cell origin or Sezary syndrome or from normal adults and lymph node cells from a patient with immunoblastic lymphadenopathy-like T-cell lymphoma did not express the retroviral antigen even after cultivation in vitro and did not induce syncytia upon cocultivation with 8C cells. Thus, there was complete agreement between the presence of the retroviral antigen in established T-cell lines or freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes and their ability to induce syncytia. Syncytia formation was enhanced 5- to 20-fold by the presence of Polybrene and inhibited by addition of plasma of ATL patients to the cocultures. Syncytia were detected within 4 hr on cocultivation of 8C cells with the retroviral antigen-positive T-cells, indicating that most syncytia were formed by early polykaryocytosis. After cocultivation, a clone of 8C cells that harbored the ATL virus genome and had syncytia-inducing activity was isolated. These findings indicate that the retrovirus associated with ATL has syncytia-inducing activity. Syncytia induction assay using 8C cells will be useful for detection and characterization of human retrovirus associated with T-cell malignancies.",,PMC390050,,,,,,,

The HTLV-II-infected T-cell line Mo-T was lethally x-irradiated and cocultivated with normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The cocultivation of normal cells with Mo-T cells resulted in the transformation of the normal cells as evidenced by the establishment of permanent cell lines. The transformed cells are infected with HTLV-II as shown by immunologic tests and molecular hybridization. The cells are of mature T-cell phenotype and constitutively produce lymphokines. An Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblast B-cell line established from peripheral blood cells of the patient Mo, designated Mo-B, also was found to be infected with HTLV-II.

Previous analyses indicated that the genome of E26 also contained nucleotide sequences distinct from v-myb and unrelated to viral replicative genes. Using a molecularly cloned E26 provirus, we have now identified a novel nucleotide sequence designated v-ets (for E-twenty-six specific) of approximately 1.5 kilobase pairs (kbp) located next to v-myb. v-ets possesses all the structural characteristics of a putative new oncogene: it has a conserved cellular counterpart c-ets which is transcribed in some normal chicken cells as a major 7.5-kb polyadenylated RNA.

This interaction results in the selective targeting of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes. While this pathway is operative in many cell types, we have found four cultured cell lines that are deficient in the ability to bind lysosomal enzymes containing phosphomannosyl residues to their intracellular or surface membranes (Gabel, C., D. Goldberg, and S. Kornfeld, 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 80:775-779). These cells appear to segregate lysosomal enzymes by an alternate intracellular pathway.

The cells were labeled with [2-3H]mannose or [35S]methionine and the receptor was immunoprecipitated with an antireceptor antiserum. BW5147 cells synthesize a receptor protein whose size increases after translation/glycosylation. MOPC 315 cells produce an apparently normal receptor and degrade it rapidly. P388D1 cells fail to synthesize any detectable receptor. The receptor from BW5147 and MOPC 315 cells is a glycoprotein with both high mannose and complex asparagine-linked oligosaccharides.

Unlike the MuLV structural glycoproteins, gp52 is defective in its transport to the cell surface. We have studied aspects of the intracellular transport and membrane association of gp52 to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the defective transport process. It was found that a panel of monoclonal antibodies to different epitopes of p 15E, as well as an antiserum to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the carboxy terminus of MuLV envelope precursors, failed to react with gp52. Despite the possible absence of membrane-anchoring regions of MuLV envelope proteins known to reside on p 15E, gp52 was not found to be secreted into the culture fluids. Detergent extraction studies indicated that gp52 is associated with the membranes and not the contents of microsomal vesicles in speen focus-forming virus-infected cells. gp65, the processed form of gp52, could be labeled with [3H]palmitic acid, suggesting a membrane association. To determine whether a spontaneous denaturation occurs leading to aggregation and defective transport of gp52, we studied the surface expression of gp52 in cells grown at different temperatures, as well as the solubility of gp52 in low concentrations of Triton X-100. No evidence of aggregation or of a temperature-dependent difference in transport was obtained. gp52 appears to be a monotopic integral membrane protein, unlike MuLV envelope proteins which are bitopic integral membrane proteins; proteolytic digestion of intact microsomal vesicles did not reveal a detectable cytoplasmic tail under conditions where this could be demonstrated on MuLV envelope precursors. We suggest that a loss of putative signals involved in mediating intracellular transport is a likely cause for the defective transport of the spleen focus-forming virus glycoproteins.",['CA 18611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

First, the 5' end of mouse rRNA was located to an ApC . . . by high resolution S1 nuclease mapping. Dinucleotide primers were then used in transcription reactions to demonstrate that this position is the actual de novo initiation site, and not a rapid RNA processing site. For this analysis, initiation was inhibited by reduced rXTP concentration, and, upon supplementation with various dinucleotides, only ApC stimulated correct synthesis. Independently confirming its role as the initiating nucleotide, ATP was shown to be required at a much higher concentration than the other rXTPs for RNA initiation, but not for elongation. These results also demonstrate a marked sequence conservation of rRNA initiation sites between the mouse and frog, two species that violate the general rule of species specificity in RNA polymerase I initiation. Extending these studies to RNA polymerase III, the initiation site for 5 S RNA can be similarly located by dinucleotide analysis and confirmed from the concentration requirements of each rXTP. In addition to allowing initiation at suboptimal rXTP concentration, dinucleotide primers can also circumvent the need for a factor normally required for initiation, suggesting their potential value in dissecting the mechanism of eukaryotic transcription.",,,,,,,,,

Sera were prescreened for antibodies to p24. Of those positive, 67% of the ATL sera and 78% of the normal sera were further shown to have antibodies against p19. In both groups 17% had antibodies to p15. Generally, the average antibody titers were twice as high in ATL as in normal sera. Competition radioimmunoprecipitation assays done with various sera and involving HTLV-producing cells, virus-positive cells from a Japanese ATL patient, and virus-positive cultured T cells of one of his healthy family members as competing materials demonstrated no differences between the p24, p19, and p15 found in these cells. These results provide strong and detailed immunological evidence that the human retrovirus isolates first made from US patients with cutaneous T-cell malignancies, and those made later in Japanese ATL are either identical or very closely related strains of the same virus, HTLV, a finding verified in other detailed analyses of the HTLV genomes of the respective isolates.

Eight polymorphic cut sites for HindIII and PvuII were discovered in class I-associated sequences of LCL 721.

These viruses were thought to express their oncogenic potential through a gag-myc fusion polyprotein, since fusion polyproteins were found in all tested cells transformed by MC29. We show here that MH2 virus does not conform to this model. Whereas MC29 produces only one mRNA detectable by RNA blotting in productively transformed cells, we reported recently that OK10 induced the synthesis of two myc-containing mRNAs, the smaller species being a spliced mRNA and a possible candidate for a transforming protein lacking gag determinants. However, the studies with OK10 were ambiguous because this virus produced also, in infected cells, a fusion protein containing gag, pol and myc determinants. We have therefore investigated the transcription pattern of the two other members of this group of viruses, namely CMII and MH2. Our results show that CMII resembles MC29 whereas MH2 produces, as OK10, two mRNAs containing myc-related sequences. However, unlike OK10, the MH2 fusion protein of 100 kd described previously cannot contain myc determinants and thus is likely to produce from its subgenomic mRNA a v-myc protein-lacking gag determinants. We thus conclude that the product of the v-myc oncogene is transforming with (MC29) or without (MH2) its fusion to gag determinants and that the multiple oncogenic spectrum is not basically affected since MH2 and MC29 both transform macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells.",,PMC555193,,,,,,,

These v-myc sequences are closely related to the v-myc transforming gene of avian acute leukemia virus MC29, and to the cellular chicken gene c-myc. The gag and myc domains on the MH2 provirus are separated by unique sequences, 1.3 kb in size and termed v-mil, which are unrelated to v-myc, or to other oncogenes or structural genes of the avian leukemia-sarcoma group of retroviruses. Normal chicken DNA contains sequences closely related to v-mil, termed c-mil. Analyses of chicken c-mil clones isolated from a recombinant DNA library of the chicken genome reveal that c-mil is a single genetic locus with a complex split gene structure. In the MH2 genome, v-mil is expressed via genome-sized mRNA as a gag-related hybrid protein, p100gag-mil, while v-myc is apparently expressed via subgenomic mRNA independently from major coding regions of structural genes. The presence in the MH2 genome of two unrelated cell-derived sequences and their independent expression may be significant for the oncogenic specificities of this virus.",,PMC555395,,,,,,,

The variant clones, however, were resistant to 120 nM 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. One of the variant clones was also insensitive to other potential inducers such as 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate, actinomycin D, and dimethyl sulfoxide. When the variant clones were incubated with 1 alpha,25(OH)2[3H]D3, they took up much less radioactivity than the parent clone into the whole cells, and into the cytosol protein-bound and chromatin-bound fractions. The variant clones were found to possess reduced amounts of the cytosol receptor protein to which 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 was specifically bound; but the hormone-receptor complex could be transferred to the chromatin acceptor sites similarly both in the wild type clone and its variant clones, indicating that one of the major defects in the 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3-resistant clones is the reduced amounts of the specific cytosol receptor.

It is presumed that human acute GVHD is analogous to the murine model which is initiated by donor T lymphocytes reacting with recipient 'minor' histocompatibility antigens. Chronic GVHD may result from immunoaggression of donor lymphoid cells that have developed and differentiated within the host. Lack of GVHD (i.e., the development of tolerance) may be due either to generation within the host of specific suppressor lymphocytes or to clonal deletion of alloreactive donor cells. Over the last five years progress has been made in the recognition, early diagnosis and successful therapy of chronic GVHD. Methods of prevention and therapy of acute GVHD are still largely unsuccessful. With improved understanding of immune regulation, it is hoped that GVHD can be eliminated in patients transplanted for non-malignant conditions and adroitly modified (without loss of anti-leukaemic potential) in patients with malignant disorders. The challenge of the coming decade is to reach these goals while speeding the return of full immunological competence in the marrow transplant recipient.","['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,59,,,,,

Infection of basal cells with Kirsten or Harvey sarcoma virus causes a marked stimulation of basal cell proliferation. Challenge of infected basal cell cultures with 0.5 mM Ca2+ medium indicates that terminal differentiation is altered, since infected cultures persist in this medium for long periods without stratifying and sloughing from the culture dish. Infected cultures express much higher levels of protein with a molecular weight of 21,000 than controls, and studies with temperature-sensitive mutants indicate that persistent function of protein with a molecular weight of 21,000 is required for the observed effects of the sarcoma viruses on terminal differentiation. In response to 0.5 mM Ca2+, the proliferation rate is markedly reduced in both control and virally infected cells. However, the proliferation rate of the sarcoma virus-infected cultures is reduced less in response to elevated levels of calcium. Virus-infected cells as well as controls also demonstrate a rise in the differentiation-associated enzymatic activity of epidermal transglutaminase and will terminally differentiate when the multiplicity of infection is below one. These results suggest that sarcoma virus-infected cells are not blocked completely in their program of terminal differentiation in response to 0.5 mM Ca2+ and differ in this respect from epidermal cells altered by exposure to chemical carcinogens and from malignant keratinocytes. Infection with Kirsten or Harvey sarcoma virus and expression of protein with a molecular weight of 21,000 therefore are closely linked to epidermal proliferation and retard, but do not completely block, the program of terminal differentiation. The effects of ras oncogenes on NIH 3T3 cells are discussed relative to the effects of ras oncogenes observed on the primary mouse epidermal cells in the context of multistep models for naturally occurring epithelial cancers.",,,,,,,,,

At 1 nM, 40% of the cells of one sensitive clone exhibited differentiation after 2 days of incubation judging from assays for phagocytosis and capacity to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium. Induction appeared to occur by binding of the cholecalciferol to a specific cytoplasmic and/or nuclear receptor for 1,25(OH)2D3. However, the presence of this receptor was not sufficient for differentiation, since one clone which contained the receptor did not respond with differentiation upon addition of 1,25(OH)2D3. Differentiation induction did not require DNA synthesis but was blocked by agents which inhibit RNA or protein synthesis. It was also blocked by the calcium ionophore A 23187. A synergistic inducing effect was seen between 1,25(OH)2D3 and retinoic acid. In addition, the U-937 cells could be primed by a short incubation with 1,25(OH)2D3 to respond, with maturation, to the addition of agents which increase the intracellular level of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, such as prostaglandin E2, cholera toxin, and N6,O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and which alone did not induce differentiation. Priming does not depend on the normal rate of RNA or protein synthesis, since it was not significantly inhibited by actinomycin D, cordycepin, or cycloheximide. It remains to be determined if unoccupied receptors for 1,25(OH)2D3 are present in fresh leukemia cells and if such cells can sometimes be induced to differentiate upon addition of cholecalciferol.",,,,,,,,,

Environmental ALV exposure of uninfected chicks after hatching induced 7-10% of the progeny from lines E and F to become congenital transmitters but had negligible effects on line D. Neither errors in identifying dams nor horizontal transmission leading to congenital transmission were great enough to explain the lack of improvements in the three lines on the breeder's premises.

The existence of these two gene products has prompted the question of whether one or both proteins are required in the transformation of erythroblasts and fibroblasts by AEV. In the accompanying manuscript, we describe the use of site-specific mutagenesis to generate mutants of AEV unable to synthesize P61-68erb-B. Here we present our analysis of the oncogenic potential of an AEV mutant unable to synthesize P74gag-erb-A due to a large deletion encompassing both gag and v-erb-A sequences. The erb-A-mutant retrovirus propagated quite poorly on fibroblasts in culture; however, fibroblasts harboring the erb-A mutant genome were transformed in the absence of P74gag-erb-A expression. The mutant virus failed to induce erythroleukemias in chickens, but the validity of this finding is compromised by the poor replicative capacity of the mutant. The results presented in this and the preceding manuscript indicate that P61-68erb-B is both necessary and sufficient for neoplastic transformation of fibroblasts by AEV; by contrast, a role for p74gag-erb-A in leukemogenesis by AEV has not yet been rigorously excluded.",,,,,['GENBANK/K00613'],,,,

Many structural features common to the integrated retroviral LTRs such as ""CAT"" box, ""TATAA"" box, polyadenylation signal, and terminal inverted repeat (3 bp), were present on each LTR. The estimated length of R region (about 60 bp) was similar to that of the murine leukemia-sarcoma virus. In contrast, the calculated U5 region of 54 bp was the shortest among those of the retroviruses so far studied. Furthermore, from the analysis of primer binding sites, phenylalanine tRNA was for the first time identified as a presumed primer tRNA for reverse transcription. These results clearly distinguish Syrian hamster IAP LTRs from other retroviral ones.

This activated template assembles prior to the onset of transcription as a preinitiation complex and factors remain firmly attached during active elongation as well. Sequential addition of differently marked rRNA genes to an S-100 mouse cell extract shows that the DNA binding factors of the stable complex are present in limiting quantities. They associate rapidly with template molecules and the resultant transcription complex remains intact over prolonged periods of incubation in the presence of competitor DNA. The resistance of the stable complex to the usual inhibitory effect of high DNA concentration suggests that more than one DNA binding factor recognizes the rDNA promoter region and is needed to direct faithful transcription. Finally, although the stable complex is specific for the rRNA initiation region, added vector sequences can neutralize nonspecific DNA binding components that are also present in the cell extract. This lowers the requirement for rDNA template and demonstrates that each activated rRNA gene can direct at least 10 rounds of elongation and reinitiation.",,PMC326437,,,,,,,

The initial rates of uridine, adenosine, and thymidine transport in L1210 cells were only partially inhibited by 1 microM nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), a potent inhibitor of nucleoside transport in other cells. The IC50 for NBMPR inhibition of uridine transport was 5 nM, but 20% of the activity remained insensitive to concentrations as high as 3 microM. Uridine uptake in the presence of 1 microM NBMPR was saturable and was inhibited by other nucleosides, suggesting the participation of an NBMPR-insensitive transport mechanism. There appeared to be little difference in the specificity of NBMPR-sensitive and -insensitive transport for the physiological nucleosides. Uridine, adenosine, and thymidine were all substrates for both mechanisms, and the Km values for total and NBMPR-insensitive uridine transport were the same (250 microM). Furthermore, little difference was found in the ability of several other nucleosides to inhibit total or NBMPR-insensitive uridine transport. In both cases, adenosine was the most effective inhibitor while cytidine and deoxycytidine were the least effective. The two transport processes did, however, differ from each other in their sensitivity to p-mercuribenzenesulfonate (pMBS). NBMPR-insensitive uridine transport was inhibited by pMBS with an IC50 less than 25 microM, while the IC50 for NBMPR-sensitive transport was greater than 400 microM. Cloning of the parent L1210 cell line indicated that both NBMPR-sensitive and -insensitive transport occurred in the same cell. Both types of uridine transport activity were also observed in three other cell lines (RPMI 6410, L5178Y, and P388), while two lines, S49 and Walker 256, exhibited only NBMPR-sensitive and -insensitive transport, respectively. The level of NBMPR-insensitive transport was an important determinant in the ability of NBMPR to inhibit uridine uptake over prolonged periods (10 min), with as little as 20% NBMPR-insensitive transport sufficient to render uptake over 10 min virtually insensitive to NBMPR. The existence of these two types of nucleoside transport activity in mammalian cells may have important implications in the chemotherapeutic use of transport inhibitors in combination with cytotoxic nucleosides or with inhibitors of pyrimidine and purine biosynthesis.","['CA 21677/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

There are no morphologic features which allow reliable differentiation between the causes of bone marrow granuloma. By combining careful histologic, microbiologic, and serologic techniques, an etiology can be documented in most (87%) patients with marrow granulomas. A medication history is an important element of this evaluation. Rocky Mountain spotted fever, cytomegalovirus infection, ibuprofen, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and various collagen vascular diseases should be added to the list of causes of marrow granuloma.

It was later found that N-tropic MuLVs were in fact restricted in BALB/c cells, that B-tropic MuLVs were restricted in NIH cells, and that both viruses were restricted in (BALB X NIH) F1 cells. A single gene, Fv-1, with two alleles, Fv-1b and Fv-1n, determines this dominant restriction. A virus-encoded protein seems to carry the viral host range determinant which is recognized by the Fv-1 gene product. To map the viral DNA sequences encoding this determinant, we constructed viral DNA recombinants in vitro between the cloned infectious viral DNA genomes from BALB/c N-tropic and B-tropic MuLVs. Infectious recombinant MuLVs were recovered by microinjecting these recombinant DNAs into murine Fv-1- SC-1 cells and were subsequently tested in vitro for their host ranges (N- or B-tropic). We found that a short 302-base pair 5'-end fragment was necessary and sufficient to confer a specific host range to a recombinant. Our sequencing data revealed that this fragment codes for amino acid sequences in gag p30. They also showed that only two consecutive amino acid differences, Gln-ArgN- and Thr-GluB-, in p30 are responsible for the N- and B-tropic host ranges of the BALB/c MuLVs, respectively.

We therefore assayed receptor on promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells at early times after exposure to a stimulus for proliferation (subculture), as well as agents that either induce differentiation (dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO] ) or inhibit iron uptake (transferrin-gallium). Within 4 h after subculture, we found that a significant increase in total cellular immunoreactive receptor occurred that preceded by 8 h the increase in cell-surface transferrin binding. Automated fluorocytometric analysis of cells in an immunofluorescent assay indicated that increased surface receptor density appeared on cells in the S, G2, and M phases of the cell cycle. DMSO-treated cells proliferated at the same rate as untreated (control) cells for the first 72 h, but as early as 12 h after treatment transferrin receptor was significantly decreased (65% of control cells). Further decreases occurred at later time points until transferrin receptor was undetectable after 7 d, when proliferation had ceased, cells were arrested in G1 phase of the cell cycle, and myeloid differentiation occurred. After exposure to transferrin-gallium, proliferation ceased, but cells exhibited increased surface receptor and were arrested at S phase of the cell cycle without associated myeloid differentiation. We conclude that events preceding cell division provide the regulatory stimulus for the synthesis and subsequent appearance of the transferrin receptor on the cell surface. Additionally, decreased receptor expression may be important in causing cessation of proliferation and/or differentiation. Finally, the way in which gallium salts are currently being investigated as chemotherapeutic agents should be reevaluated in light of our findings concerning transferrin-gallium effects on cellular proliferation.",['AM 27039/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],PMC370415,,,,,,,

Two types of assay have been used. Firstly, the ability of recombinant plasmids to transform TK- recipient cells to a TK+ phenotype was measured. Secondly, the amount of tk-specific RNA and TK enzyme activity transiently expressed after DNA transfection was determined. Both types of assay gave similar results. The enhancers increased tk gene expression by regulating the amount of full length tk mRNA present shortly after transfection independent of gene copy number. Furthermore, marked species specificity in the relative efficiencies of different enhancers was observed, including that of the BPV-1 enhancer for the first time. The MoMuSV enhancer showed preference for murine fibroblasts, while the papillomavirus enhancer showed a marked preference for bovine cells.

In this brief overview, evidences are presented that retrovirus-like particles can regularly be demonstrated in human teratocarcinomas cultured in vitro. These viruses are morphologically reminiscent of animal retrovirus strains but show also unique structural features. The viruses possess endogenous reverse transcriptase activity and can be banded at 1.16 g/ml in sucrose gradients, a density characteristic of retroviruses. They can clearly be distinguished from animal retrovirus strains on immunological grounds. We will also briefly summarize the data accumulating for the human T-cell lymphoma viruses (HTLV) which were recently discovered first by Gallo et al. and independently by Hinuma and Miyoshi. HTLV seem to play an etiological role in the establishment of human adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and thus represent the first pathogenic human retroviruses.",,,,,,,,,

The examination of AMP activity was useful for the diagnosis of non-lymphocytic leukemia in 19 of 36 cases rather than PO activity. Especially in acute monocytic leukemia its tendency was conspicuous. Furthermore, in 5 cases AMP was positive whereas there was no evidence of PO activity. On the contrary, PO was evident in 11 cases. The cases which revealed the same degree of both activities were only 4 and in 2 cases they were completely negative. Although the total number of PO negative cases was 7, ultrastructural endogenous myeloperoxidase reaction was clearly observed in granules of leukemic cells in all cases examined (6 cases). The diagnosis and classification of leukemia must be made using several techniques, and especially in non-lymphocytic leukemia cases, not only PO activity but also the examination of AMP activity is important. Therefore, one must be prudent in applying the FAB classification in acute leukemia.",,,,,,,,,

Recombinant viruses were selected for rapid growth and subgroup E envelopes. The T1 oligonucleotide fingerprint patterns of viruses selected in this manner demonstrated that they were recombinants and were clonally pure because they had oligonucleotides from each parent, and each oligonucleotide was present in single molar yield. When injected into 10-day-old chicken embryos, approximately 50% of the recombinant viruses induced osteopetrosis within 3 weeks after hatch. Therefore, subgroup E envelope did not inhibit osteopetrosis induction. The osteopetrosis that was induced varied from slight to severe, but none of the recombinant viruses induced osteopetrosis as severe as the MAV-2(O) parent.","['CA09111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA14236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

All the enzymes leading to the formation of LTB4 from arachidonic acid are localized in the soluble fraction (100,000 x g supernatant) of these cells. The formation of LTA4 and LTB4 is complete by 10 min. When we varied the arachidonic acid concentration from 1 to 300 microM, the synthesis of LTB4 leveled off at 30 microM and of LTA4 at 100 microM while 5-HETE had not reached a plateau at 300 microM. This enzyme system has the capacity to generate relatively large amounts of 5-HETE and LTA4 and only a relatively small amount of LTB4. Therefore, the rate limiting step is not the 5-lipoxygenase, the first step in the pathway, but the conversion of LTA4 to LTB4. This is in contrast to cyclooxygenase pathway where the first step is rate limiting. A second addition of arachidonic acid at submaximal concentration for LTA4 synthesis did not produce any additional LTA4 or LTB4. Further study of this phenomenon showed that the 5-lipoxygenase and LTA-synthase were inactivated with time by preincubation with arachidonic acid and that peroxy fatty acids seem to be the inactivating species.","['2RO1-HL21874-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5P30-CA16217-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Analysis of a number of clones identified long terminal repeat structures (LTRs) characteristic of retrovirus proviruses and transposable genetic elements. Whilst the unique region of all clones was identical, the LTRs displayed some heterogeneity. Comparison of the unique region of cloned VL30 DNA with mouse genomic VL30 sequences showed the retrovirus-derived clones to be encoded by only a few members of the divergent VL30 gene family.

Serum ketoconazole levels were measured using the inhibition assay of mycotic culture in gelose, and they were studied at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after ketoconazole ingestion, and repeated serially after bone marrow transplantation. In these transplanted patients, absorption of ketoconazole could be delayed, with the maximum levels at 4 h or 6 h after ingestion. Most measurements showed appropriate levels (maximum levels greater than 1 mg/l) even after the third week post transplantation. With the exception of severe acute GVH disease (1 patient), the ketoconazole absorption was adequate in minor or mild GVH disease (6 patients) and in chronic GVH disease (2 patients). In four patients ketoconazole absorption was compared with gut absorption tests (Schilling's test, Iron absorption test, xylose test): In all patients the maximum serum levels of ketoconazole were correct, even in three patients with abnormal gut absorption tests. In this series, no life-threatening mycotic infection occurred, and the three deaths observed showed no mycotic infection.",,,,,,,,,

The highest sensitivity of the assay were observed when cell sheets of 30 to 50% confluence were inoculated with a stock of BLV, and when cells containing 4 or more nuclei were counted as syncytial cells. Treatment of the cell sheets with a diethylamino-ethyl-dextran solution (25 micrograms/ml) prior to BLV inoculation was found to be essential for the optimal induction of syncytia. Low-passage cultures were found to be more susceptible to the induction of syncytia by BLV than high-passage cultures. Cell-free BLV preparations decreased in syncytia-inducing ability to some extent by the first cycle of freezing (at -70 degrees C) and thawing. No further decrease, however, was caused by repeated cycles of freezing and thawing or by prolonged incuvation at -80 degrees C. The syncytia-inducing activity of BLV was inhibited by all the BLV-precipitating antibody-positive sera originated from both cases of the adult form of bovine leukosis and cases of persistent lymphocytosis. It was not inhibited by the sera of 16 of 17 cattle apparently healthy and negative for BLV-precipitating antibody.

In Wilms' tumour (WT) and retinoblastoma, a chromosomal deletion occurs germinally or somatically and has been considered an important step in tumour development. One class of potential cellular transforming genes comprises the cellular homologues of the transforming genes of highly oncogenic retroviruses. A remarkable concordance between the chromosomal location of human cellular oncogenes and the breakpoints involved in acquired chromosomal translocations is becoming apparent in various cancers: the oncogenes c-mos, c-myc and c-abl are located at the breakpoints that occur in acute myeloblastic leukaemia, Burkitt's lymphoma and chronic myelocytic leukaemia respectively. Thus when the oncogene c-Ha-ras1 was localized to the short arm of human chromosome 11 (refs 6-8; region 11p11 leads to p15 and not 11p13 as stated in ref. 5), it was proposed as a possible aetiological agent in the aniridia-WT association (AWTA) that results from a deletion of 11p13 (although a transforming gene recently isolated from a WT cell line (G401) was shown not to be homologous to either c-Ha-ras or c-Ki-ras9). We have now looked for deletion or rearrangement of c-Ha-ras1 in the DNA from four subjects with del(11p13)-associated predisposition to Wilms' tumour, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities and mental retardation. We report here that in no case is c-Ha-ras1 deleted, and we have further refined its location to 11p15.1 leads to 11p15.5. On the basis of enzyme studies and direct gene dosage determination for c-Ha-ras1 and beta-globin in neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues from one patient, we conclude that deletion of the normal counterpart of 11p cannot account for the development of the tumour.",,,,,,,,,

Foci induced by GR-FeSV DNA contained rescuable sarcoma virus and expressed GR-P70, the major GR-FeSV translational product. The localization of long-terminal repeats within the DNA clone made it possible to establish the length of the GR-FeSV provirus as 4.6 kilobase pairs.

The size of this region was sufficient to encode a protein of approximately 68,000 daltons and was localized immediately downstream of the FeLV gag gene coding sequences present in GR-FeSV.

Studies in the murine and feline retrovirus systems suggest that the 15,000-dalton envelope protein (p15E) of the virion may contribute to immunosuppression by interfering with normal lymphocyte function. We examined the effect of inactivated feline leukemia virus (UV-FeLV) and p15E derived from this virus on concanavalin A (Con A) driven human T cell proliferation. Virus and p15E markedly suppressed mononuclear cell proliferative response to Con A. Suppression was not due to inhibition of monocyte accessory cell function, or interleukin 1 (IL 1) secretion. In fact, the presence of monocytes partially protected T cells from UV-FeLV suppression. UV-FeLV, however, suppressed T cell secretion of and response to interleukin 2 (IL 2). We conclude that UV-FeLV and derived p15E inhibit T cell proliferation by direct inhibition of T cell function. These findings, extended to the in vivo situations, suggest that retrovirus-associated suppression of the immune response involves the induction of T cell but not monocyte dysfunction.","['714665/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA-31547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

In vitro tests of phagocytosis and killing of Candida guilliermondii and Staphylococcus aureus identified 13 patients with abnormal neutrophil function at presentation and a further 10 who developed abnormalities during the course of their disease. The incidence of defective function in the five disease categories in this series was: refractory cytopenia (RC) 8/17; refractory cytopenia with sideroblastic change (RC + SC) 5/8; acquired idiopathic sideroblastic anaemia (AISA) 2/4; refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB) 7/11; chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) 1/4. Eleven of 23 patients with defective neutrophil function experienced severe infective complications; in only three of these patients were neutrophil counts less than 1 X 10(9)/l and susceptibility to infection was considered to reflect, at least partially, qualitative neutrophil abnormalities. There was no correlation between absolute neutrophil count and defective function. Abnormal overall neutrophil microbicidal activity was equally associated with impaired and normal phagocytosis. Some patients with intracellular killing defects had reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities and one had reduced hexose monophosphate shunt (HMPS) activity. In two patients, whose neutrophils showed markedly impaired candidacidal activity, levamisole corrected function when added in vitro at 10(-7) M and also when administered in therapeutic dosage. It is suggested that deranged function, probably reflecting abnormalities in maturation of the granulocyte series, occurs across the myelodysplastic spectrum and that several microbicidal mechanisms may be defective.",,PMC498487,,,,,,,

Sera containing complement-dependent antibodies (CDA), which lysed FeLV-producer lymphoma lines, had no cytotoxic effects when tested against FeLV-producer FeSV-transformed fibroblasts. Sera with lytic CDA activity were also tested for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxic (ADCC) effects with peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from nonimmune cats. No ADCC activity was detected against either lymphoid or fibroblast target lines. To demonstrate that cat PBL contained ADCC effector cells, antibody-coated murine target cells were employed and positive results obtained. Natural killer (NK) assays were performed using PBL from normal and tumor-bearing cats. Cytotoxic effects were only detectable to FeLV-producer lymphomas, and comparable levels of NK activity were found in normal and lymphoid tumor-bearing animals. In cats immunized with ATF, a population of effector cells was found in peripheral blood which had functional characteristics of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). The killing of ATF by CTL-like cells was not inhibited by FeLV/FeSV immune sera or by sera from autochthonous immune cats. The comparative importance of humoral and cellular cytotoxic mechanisms against FeLV- and FeSV-induced tumors is discussed.","['CA 24608/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Southern blot analysis of two gamma 2b-producing clones was performed in comparison to that of their respective parent clones. The results showed that isotype switching can operate at the stage of pre-B cells by a CH gene deletion mechanism without utilizing the switch region. In addition, the possibility is presented that deletion of the intervening CH genes could occur prior to the formation of the functional V region-coding DNA segment. This indicates that the prior expression of mu chains is not obligatory for the expression of other isotypes and that isotype commitment could occur in pre-B cells.",,,,,,,,,

APase was found in numerous lymphoblasts of the fetal thymus. The enzyme was also detected in a few lymphoid blast cells of the normal young adult thymus, which were closely associated with thymic nurse cells. The observed distribution of APase in normal thymus suggests that its expression could be limited to an early stage of the T-cell differentiation pathway. After inoculation with radiation leukemia virus, APase activity remained normal for almost the entire latency period, during which virus replication spread to the cortex and thymus-dependent preleukemic cells appeared. An important increase in the number of APase-positive cells occurred later, i.e., at the end of the latency period, in nontumoral thymus, which displayed lymphocytic depletion and contained autonomous thymus-independent preleukemic cells. These latter features obviously reflected the malignant transformation of thymus lymphoblasts, which eventually led to the development of the thymic lymphomas. The results raise the question of the possible filiation between the thymic nurse cell-associated APase-positive lymphoid cells of the normal thymus and the target cells susceptible to productive infection and to neoplastic transformation after radiation leukemia virus infection.",,,,,,,,,

Autoradiography has shown specific nuclear localization of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in target organs prior to initiation of mechanism of action. Specific nuclear localization has also been demonstrated in a variety of other tissues not previously appreciated as targets of vitamin D action, suggesting the possibility that vitamin D carries out subtle functions previously unappreciated. A macromolecule believed to be a receptor that specifically binds 1,35-(OH)2D3 has been found in the cells showing nuclear localization and in a number of tumor and cancer cell lines. Since 1,25-(OH)2D3 has been found to cause differentiation of certain myeloid leukemia cells, a possible relationship between the vitamin D system and cancer has appeared. Substantial evidence exists that 1,25-(OH)2D3 functions in a nuclear-mediated process, although some evidence exists that not all of the actions of 1,25-(OH)2D3 are carried out through such a mechanism. Substantial advances in our understanding of the metabolism of vitamin D have also been made. The presence of significant amounts of 1 alpha-hydroxylase has been located in the placenta in addition to the kidney. Although there have been reports of extrarenal synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2D3, these sites, if they produce 1,25-(OH)2D3, produce it in insufficient amounts for function. The renal 1 alpha-hydroxylase has been solubilized and shown to be a three-component system. The 25-hydroxylase in the liver has also been solubilized and shown to be a two-component mixed-function monooxygenase. New pathways of vitamin D metabolism include a 23-oxidation to form 23,25-(OH)2D3 or a 23-hydroxylated form of 1,25-(OH)2D3. 23,25-(OH)2D3 is further oxidized to produce a 25-(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone. Although these pathways are of significant magnitude, their roles remain unknown since the products have low biological activity. Important analogs of the vitamin D metabolites include 24,24-F2-25-OH-D3 and the 26,26,26,27,27,27-F6-25-OH-D3. These have been used to show that the 24-hydroxylation, the 26-hydroxylation, and the lactone formation do not play a significant role in the function of vitamin D. Their 1-hydroxy analogs have also been prepared and shown to be extremely biologically active, being somewhere around ten times more active than the native 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, illustrating that important analogs of the vitamin D system continue to be discovered.",['AM-14881/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,302,,['NASA: 83307240'],,,

Although amdinocillin, alone or in combination with cefoxitin, appeared effective as second-line therapy in infections with organisms shown sensitive in vitro, the combination of amdinocillin and ticarcillin or carbenicillin was only moderately effective in initial therapy for neutropenic, febrile, cancer patients.",,,,,,,,,

The relative spontaneous cytotoxicity for 51Cr-labelled K562 cells, derived from a human myeloid leukemia, increased at completion of irradiation and remained elevated during the entire observation period. The relative cytotoxicity against Chang cells, derived from human liver, also seemed to increase but not to the same extent. The increments were probably due to an increased proportion of spontaneously cytotoxic cells bearing Fc-receptors for IgG which were significantly elevated after treatment.

Treatment of the HL-60 promyelocytes with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate or human interleukin 2 resulted in the appearance of cells with monocytic characteristics (morphology, non-specific esterase, adherence, reaction with a monocyte-specific monoclonal antibody). Induction with retinoic acid resulted in differentiation to cells with typical features of mature granulocytes (morphology, peroxidase, nitro-blue tetrazolium reduction). During maturation to monocytes, the density of beta-adrenergic receptors decreased, whereas it remained constant during maturation to granulocytes. In comparison with normal circulating monocytes or polymorphonuclear granulocytes, expression of beta-adrenergic receptors on the surface of the differentiated HL-60 cells was low. Activation of AC by the hormones isoproterenol, prostaglandin E1, and histamine generally decreased with HL-60 maturation and enzyme activities were markedly below those measured in normal peripheral leukocytes. In the induced monocytic HL-60 cells, the weak effectiveness of isoproterenol was due to the loss of beta-adrenergic receptors. In the induced granulocytic HL-60 cells, the reduced hormonal AC activation could be explained by the impaired coupling between hormone receptors and catalytic enzyme unit. The concentration of intracellular cAMP after differentiation of HL-60 cells reflected the increase in basal AC activity and the decrease in hormone stimulation of the enzyme. Our data indicate that HL-60 cells induced to differentiate possess some monocyte- and granulocyte-like properties, but do not meet several important functional criteria of their new cell identities.",,,In-vitro-Differenzierung leukamischer Promyelozyten (HL-60): Verhalten der beta-adrenergen Rezeptoren und der Adenylatzyklaseaktivitat.,,,,,,

The orientation of these regions in gp70 was determined by analysis of the immunoreactivities of proteolytic products generated from the MuLV PrENV polyprotein toward monoclonal alpha p15(E) and alpha gp70 antibodies, and by fragmentation analysis of gp70s specifically labeled with [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine. These studies confirmed our previous assignment of a p15(E)-disulfide-linked 33K fragment to the carboxy terminus of Akv gp70 (Pinter, Honnen, Tung, O'Donnell, and Hammerling, Virology 116, 345-351, 1982). Using similar fragmentation procedures, the sizes and structural features of gp70 domains of Akv and MCF 247 MuLV gp70s were compared. Trypsinization of MCF-247 gp70 resulted in the production of a carboxy terminal fragment which resembled that of the ecotropic gp70 in that (1) it was disulfide linked to p15(E) but not to the amino terminal fragments, (2) reacted with monoclonal antibody 35/56, (3) contained cysteines but no methionines, and (4) carried only endo H-resistant oligosaccharide chains. Amino terminal MCF gp70 fragments were obtained with apparent molecular weights of 42K and 30K, considerably smaller than the corresponding Akv fragments of 49K and 35K. These MCF fragments were much more stable to degradation by trypsin than the Akv amino terminal components, indicating the loss or inaccessibility of several trypsin sites in the MCF amino terminal domain. These results demonstrated the Akv and MCF 247 gp70s contained highly conserved carboxy terminal domains but unique amino terminal sequences. Common features for both gp70s were the presence of an endo H-sensitive oligosaccharide chain near the amino terminus, and the presence of internal disulfide bonds in the amino terminal domains which resulted in an increased mobility for these fragments when analyzed under nonreducing conditions. Thus, while the amino terminal domains of the two gp70s are structurally different, certain aspects of glycosylation specificity and secondary conformation are conserved, suggesting that these structural features may be important for common biological properties of these molecules.",['CA-16599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Analysis of viral proteins synthesized in cells, which were named HNP, transformed by AEV-H but not producing transforming virus revealed tha the genome of AEV-H directed the synthesis of the gag gene products, Pr76gag and Pr180gag-pol, which was the precursor of active reverse transcriptase. Thus the HNP produced virions that were not infectious due to a defect of the env gene. Studies on the viral RNA showed that a 35 S RNA, estimated to be 8000 nucleotides long, was the genomic RNA of AEV-H and probably carried one transforming gene, which is most likely erbB gene.

One pathway results in processing and cleavage of the precursor Pr65gag to yield the internal capsid proteins of the virion and is analogous to gag polyprotein precursors for all classes of retroviruses. The other pathway, which is not encoded by several other classes of retroviruses, begins with a glycosylated polyprotein gPr80gag . gPr80gag is synthesized independently of Pr65gag; it contains Pr65gag peptides and additional amino-terminal protein. It is modified by further addition of carbohydrate, exported to the cell surface, and released from the cell but does not appear in virus particles. To investigate the role of glycosylated gag in MuLV infection, two mutants of Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV) deficient for synthesis of gPr80gag but able to synthesize Pr65gag were constructed. The mutants were obtained by substitution into a molecular clone of M-MuLV DNA by DNA from two acutely transforming viruses, Ableson MuLV (Ab-MuLV) and Moloney murine sarcoma virus (M-MSV). Both Ab-MuLV and M-MSV are derived from M-MuLV and they express M-MuLV gag sequences, but some strains do not synthesize glycosylated gag protein. For Ab-MuLV, a 177-base-pair Pst I fragment from the P90 strain containing the initiation codon for Pr65gag was substituted for the equivalent fragment in M-MuLV DNA. For M-MSV, 1.5 kilobases at the 5' end of the genome was substituted. Transfection of the recombined DNAs onto NIH-3T3 cells produced infectious M-MuLV, although the infected cells did not produce gPr80gag. Therefore glycosylated gag is not absolutely required for MuLV replication. Deletion of the glycosylated gag pathway did not significantly reduce the level of virus production, although a minor difference in XC plaque morphology was observed.","['CA32454/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07311/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC390198,,,,,,,

We have measured the membrane potential (delta psi) of RBL cells during this reaction by using the tetraphenylphosphonium ion (Ph4P+) equilibration technique. We observed a 20-45% reduction in ionophore-sensitive Ph4P+ accumulation. The phenomenon persisted under conditions expected to collapse the mitochondrial membrane potential, consistent with the effect being due to a change in delta psi of the plasma membrane. We estimated that the change reflects a depolarization of 20 mV (from -90 to -70 mV, interior negative). Whereas degranulation fails to occur in the absence of external Ca2+, this was not true of the depolarization, indicating that the latter was not a consequence of secretion. When aggregation of the receptor is induced by reaction of the cell-bound IgE with a multivalent antigen, the secretory reaction can be halted by adding a univalent hapten. In this case, complete repolarization occurs. Equivalent depolarization was observed in the absence of Na+ but was diminished when both Ca2+ and Na+ were absent. Together, the data suggest that aggregation of the receptor opens ion channels and that the latter disappear promptly when the receptors are disaggregated. It is plausible that formation of these channels leads to the entry of Ca2+ and is an early and critical consequence of the aggregation of the receptors, thereby leading to degranulation.",,PMC384335,,,,,,,

No consistent changes in time were noticed for neuroblastomas, nephroblastomas, soft tissue sarcomas, and retinoblastomas. Survival rates for both types of lymphomas and for leukemias (at least for cases diagnosed after 1975) were very similar to corresponding population-derived data from the U.S. and other Western countries.

We previously reported no change in beta-adrenergic receptor number or affinity but decreased NaF- and 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (GppNHp)-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity with age in the rat myocardium. These data suggest a defect in either N-protein or the catalytic unit component of adenylate cyclase. N-protein activity was assessed by the ability of myocardial membrane extracts from 3-, 12, and 24-month-old Fischer 344 rats to complement the N-protein deficient cyc- S49 mouse lymphoma cell line. Catalytic unit activity was assessed by the ability of forskolin to stimulate adenylate cyclase in myocardial membranes from young and old rats. The results demonstrate that both N-protein activity and catalytic unit activity are diminished with age in the rat myocardium. However, since N-protein is present in excess relative to catalytic unit, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that the loss of catalytic unit activity accounts for the loss of overall enzyme activity. The effect is tissue-specific, since erythrocyte membranes do not show the same age-dependent loss of adenylate cyclase activity.",,,,,,,,,

ADA activity was higher in E-rosette positive leukemia(E+ ALL), while HGPRT, APRT, PNP, 5'NT, ecto-5'NT and AdKin activities were found to be lower in E+ ALL as compared to E- ALL. In common ALL (cALL) antigen positive leukemia, mean ADA activity was significantly lower as compared to cALL- leukemia, whereas PNP, 5'NT, ecto-5'NT and AdKin activities were significantly higher. cALL cells with cytoplasmic immunoglobulin M(IgM) heavy chains were found to have mean 5'NT activities twice as high as cALL cells lacking cytoplasmic IgM heavy chains. In two patients who had surface immunoglobulins on their cell membranes, low 5'NT activities were found. When measuring enzyme activities after 2-4 days of prednisone monotherapy, only mean ADA and HGPRT activities decreased in non-B, non-T ALL. These decreases were not significant in T-ALL patients. Mean enzyme activities in the leukemic cells of five patients with relapse were comparable to those in newly diagnosed patients, except for 5'NT, which was found to be within the activity range of control peripheral blood lymphocytes. It is concluded that ADA and AdKin activities are suitable as markers for E+ ALL and cALL+ leukemias respectively. 5'NT might help to distinguish between cALL cells having and lacking pre-B characteristics. Since 5'NT activity may also be decreased in B-ALL, it is not suitable as a T-ALL marker. Enzymes of purine metabolism in leukemic relapse need further investigation.",,,,,,,,,

The Km for AMP showed a broad range from 19 to 210 microM in unhomogenized lymphocytes. An unexpected relationship was observed between sp. act. and this Km in that higher Km values were noted with cells from subjects with high lymphocyte 5'nucleotidase sp. act. and low Km values in lymphocyte preparations with low sp. act. When plasma membranes were prepared, a narrow range of low Km values unrelated to sp. act. was noted. The change in Km was not due to Pi concentration or nucleotide effects. The ecto-enzyme was inhibited by alpha, beta-methylene adenosine diphosphate, while cytosol phosphatase activity was not inhibited by this compound. Heat stability studies revealed a 45% loss in 5'nucleotidase activity after incubation for 20 min at 65 degrees C. A comparison of the substrate preference, Km values, effect of inhibitor and subcellular localization revealed no differences between the enzyme from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and from normal subjects.

The complexity and sequence conservation of the transformation-specific v-myc sequences of MH2 RNA were compared with those of the other members of the MC29 subgroup of acute leukemia viruses, MC29, CMII, and OK10, and with chicken cellular c-myc sequences. All T1 oligonucleotides mapping within the 1.3-kilobase coding region of MC29 v-myc have homologous counterparts in the RNAs of all MC29 subgroup viruses and in c-myc. These counterparts are either identical in composition or altered by single point mutations. Hence, the 47,000-dalton carboxy-terminal sequences of the transforming proteins of these viruses and of the cellular gene product are probably highly conserved but may contain single amino acid substitutions. T1 oligonucleotide mapping of MH2 RNA indicated that the MH2 v-myc sequences map close to the 3' end of viral RNA. A genomic library of an MH2-transformed quail cell line was prepared by using the Charon 4A vector system. By screening with an myc-specific probe, a clone containing the entire MH2 provirus (lambda MH2-1) was isolated. Digestion of cloned DNA with KpnI yielded a 5.1-kilobase fragment hybridizing to both gag- and myc-specific probes. Further restriction mapping of lambda MH2-1 DNA showed that about 1.6 kilobases of the gag gene are present near the 5' end of proviral DNA, and the conserved part of v-myc, i.e., 1.3 kilobases, is present near the 3' end of proviral DNA. These two domains are separated by a segment of at least 1 kilobase of different genetic origin, including additional unique sequences unrelated to virion genes. Tryptic peptide analysis of the gag-related protein of MH2, p100, revealed gag-specific peptides and several unique methionine-containing peptides. One of the latter is possibly shared with the polymerase precursor protein Pr180gag-pol, but no myc-specific peptides, defined for the MC29 protein p110gag-myc, appear to be present in MH2 p100. The data on viral RNA, proviral DNA, and protein of MH2 reveal a unique genetic structure for this virus of the MC29 subgroup and suggest that its v-myc gene is not expressed as a gag-related protein.",,PMC255322,,,,,,,

The MRF appears to be transmitted to the progeny mainly through the milk, since foster-nursing AKR neonates on RF (but not DBA/2) mothers greatly reduces E-MuLV expression in the progeny.

When added directly to cultures, all three antibodies caused dose-dependent inhibition of normal granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (CFU-GM) growth. Monoclonal antibody 42/6 was by far the most potent of the three, with an ID50 of less than 5 micrograms/ml. Identical effects were seen on CFU-GM from three patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Growth of colonies from two myeloid leukemia cells lines (KG-I, HL60) was also inhibited by all three antibodies, and these cells were generally more sensitive than normal CFU-GM. Blast colony-forming cells from three patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia were relatively resistant to the antibodies, and CFU-GM from a patient with myeloid metaplasia were resistant (ID50 greater than 50 micrograms/ml) to 42/6. In liquid culture, growth of the leukemic cell lines was inhibited by saturating concentrations of the three antibodies, although in both liquid and colony culture recovery was seen even after exposure to antibody for periods of up to 72 h. Analysis of the cell-cycle status of these cells showed that the antibodies did not cause accumulation of cells in any particular phase of the cell cycle. Addition to cultures of large quantities of human Tf failed to reverse the inhibitory effects of the antibodies. Competitive binding studies on the leukemia cell lines showed that only 42/6 inhibited binding of Tf to its receptor, although all three antibodies inhibited cell growth. Addition of Fe chelate (as ferric nitriloacetic acid, FeNTA) failed to reverse the inhibitory effects of the antibodies on CFU-GM and HL60 cells, but had variable effects on KG-I cell growth. FeNTA fully reversed inhibitory effects of 42/6 on KG-I cells. We conclude that monoclonal antibodies to Tf receptors can inhibit growth of both normal and malignant myeloid cells. Overall, no selectivity for malignant vs normal cells is apparent, although malignant cells from one individual were more sensitive to colony inhibition by 43/31 monoclonal antibody than normal CFU-GM.","['CA17733/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Treatment was based upon the findings that the RadLV-derived transplant lymphosarcoma (LSA) tumor was cured with a frequency of greater than 90% and a tumor-resistant state was produced by tumor cure. Death from RadLV lymphomas which had been initiated in newborn C57BL mice by ip injection of RadLV was scored in untreated or BCNU-treated mice. At 150 days after initiation, control mice had developed extensive thymic lymphomas, whereas BCNU-treated mice had developed less extensive tumors, had a reduced incidence by approximately 50% and had an increased survival time. Similar findings were noted for the radiation (190 rad of cobalt-60 gamma rays weekly X 4)-induced thymic lymphoma-bearing C57BL mice. Injection of 10(6) living LSA cells before BCNU treatment greatly decreased the tumor load for all groups treated but also shortened the mean survival time. Challenge of long-term survivors with small numbers of viable LSA tumor cells did not identify any host resistance of the survivors to the transplant LSA tumor and indicated that the induction procedure, whether RadLV or radiation, was strongly immunosuppressive.",['RR 05374/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Four clinically different types of disease were distinguished on the basis of the enzyme parameters. Lymphocytes from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) showed an enzyme profile similar to that of normal thymocytes, i.e., an elevated level of adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity as compared with normal T lymphocytes, reduced activities of purine 5'nucleotidase (5'NT) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), and a binomial distribution of the LDH isoenzyme pattern. Cells from ""null""-ALL patients had an ADA/PNP ratio that was intermediate between that of normal T cells and that of T-ALL cells or thymocytes, but their 5'NT activity and LDH isoenzyme pattern were thymocyte-like. Patients with chronic T-cell proliferation were subdivided into those with chronic T gamma lymphocytosis and those with proven chronic T malignancy. The lymphocytes from these patients had ADA and PNP activities within the ranges of those of normal T lymphocytes. However, the ADA activity and/or the ADA/PNP ratio were consistently higher in the cells from the patients with chronic T gamma lymphocytosis than in those with chronic T malignancy. The enzyme profile of the cells from the T gamma patients was similar to that of T gamma cells of normal individuals. The cells from patients with chronic T malignancies showed a heterogeneous enzyme pattern as compared with that of normal T lymphocytes. Analysis with monoclonal antibodies enabled us to distinguish null-ALL patients from the other leukemias studied, but a distinction between chronic and acute T-cell proliferation disease, for instance, was not possible with monoclonal antibodies alone.

Sixty-two of the leukemias expressed a phenotype corresponding to a recognizable immature normal myeloid cell. These 62 cases could be divided into 4 phenotype groups, corresponding approximately to the normal CFU-C (group I, 21%), myeloblast (group II, 26%), promyelocyte (group III, 8%), and promonocyte (group IV, 45%). Morphological subtyping of these leukemias tended to agree with the immunologic phenotype, particularly with more ""differentiated"" morphological subtypes, such as acute monocytic leukemia or acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, each phenotype group contained more than one morphological type of AML, indicating that the level of differentiation of the surface membrane of AML cells may not always be concordant with morphology. The phenotype groups were also analyzed with respect to cytochemical staining patterns, age, the presence of Auer rods, and complete remission rates. Statistically significant differences among the groups were noted in the distribution of myeloperoxidase staining, nonspecific esterase staining, and Auer rods. The complete remission rates varied from 60% (groups III and IV) to 88% (group II). These results suggest that surface marker analysis in AML may be used as a highly reproducible classification system that will provide additional information about the leukemic cells in conjunction with morphological analysis.","['CA 09172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 19389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25369/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

Chromosome changes characterize most tumors and exhibit a high degree of nonrandomness; in some tumors, this nonrandomness is defined by the tumor-inducing agents, while in others, it is defined by target cells of tumorigenesis. These observations led to the suggestion that chromosome abnormalities impart a selective advantage to the cells in which they occur and hence are of importance in the development of tumors. The mechanisms by which cells carrying chromosome abnormalities gain selective advantage are beginning to become apparent as the recently acquired data on the molecular genetics of neoplastic transformation are considered in conjunction with cytogenetic data. Activation of cellular oncogenes and overproduction of their products has been shown to be a key step in some types of neoplastic transformation. Chromosome abnormality is suggested to accomplish this step by either causing alterations in oncogene dosage or by activating normally quiescent oncogenes by bringing them into the transcriptional control of active genes. The paradigm for the latter model is the development of human and murine B-cell neoplasms in which specific translocations transfer c-myc from its constitutive site to a site next to the immunoglobulin genes. The chromosomal positions of several oncogenes have now been determined, and the elucidation of their fate in association with chromosome abnormalities in tumor cells can be expected to clarify mechanisms of oncogenesis.",['CA 20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,84,,,,,

Urine polysaccharides are sufficiently immunoreactive to be detectable by simple precipitin and agglutination techniques in a large percentage of patients with infections due to certain pyogenic bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae and group B streptococci.

Most BALB.B and IRW mice had a rapidly appearing, severe anemia and hepatosplenomegaly consisting of erythroid cells. MCF viruses were usually isolated from enlarged spleens of IRW mice. In contrast, C57BL/10 mice had a lower incidence of disease and much slower course. Splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy with mild anemia were seen, and the predominant cell types were either myeloid (chloroleukemia) or lymphoid. MCF viruses were never isolated from this mouse strain. (C57BL/10 X IRW)F1 mice were intermediate in latency, but all mice had disease by 8 months. Myeloid, lymphoid, and some mixed leukemias with an erythroid component were observed, but in no case did we see the severe anemia or pure erythroid involvement typical of IRW and BALB.B mice. MCF viruses were, however, isolated from 22% of these mice regardless of leukemia cell type. DBA/2 mice had a disease pattern similar to the (C57BL/10 X IRW)F1 mice, and MCF viruses were isolated from three of six mice tested. Inoculation of IRW mice with the low virulence B3 strain of F-MuLV produced disease with a longer latency than F-MuLV 57, but similar cell types were transformed by both viruses. In vitro cell lines were derived from 14 mice, and most were tumorigenic in vivo. Three lines released infectious MCF virus, and three others expressed MCF-specific cell surface antigens but did not release virus. Eight lines expressed no MCF infectious virus or viral antigens. Several lines released infectious xenotropic viruses and/or expressed xenotropic MuLV cell surface antigens recognized by monoclonal antibodies reactive with xenotropic viruses. The lack of MCF expression in many primary leukemic tissues as well as in in vitro derived leukemia cell lines of C57BL/10 and (B10 X IRW)F1 mice suggested that MCF virus generation and expression may not be required for leukemogenesis in some mouse strains or in some hemopoietic lineages.",,,,,,,,,

Studies of infected SWR/J mice at 3 days to 4 months of age indicated the following: (1) Expression of MuLV gp69/70 and p30 antigens in CNS rises beginning as early as 3 days after inoculation and increases with time. (2) Neuronal damage is evident by Day 7, and neuronal lesions develop in all mice by Day 14. (3) WM 1504-E virus can be isolated from CNS tissue by 48 hr after initiating infection. (4) Upon passage into susceptible newborn mice, the WM 1504-E isolates cause neuronal disease. (5) ""Dual-tropic"" mink cell focus forming (MCF) -like virus is found in splenic but not CNS tissues by 8 weeks after initiating infection. (6) MCF viruses that arise by env gene recombination between WM 1504-E and endogenous xenotropic viruses do not cause CNS disease upon inoculation into susceptible newborn mice. Similarly inoculated WM 1504-amphotropic virus (WM 1504-A) does not cause CNS disease (7). Results in SWR/J mice can be duplicated in C3H/St and C57Br/cdj mice. These observations define the wild mouse ecotropic virus as the sole infectious agent responsible and sufficient for the development of this neurologic disease.

Although both the human parental lines and the hybrid cells carrying the translocated c-muc oncogene expressed high levels of human specific c-myc transcripts, the hybrid cells carrying the untranslocated c-myc gene on normal chromosome 8 did not contain human specific c-myc mRNA. These results suggest that the translocated human c-myc oncogene has escaped the normal transcriptional control to which the untranslocated c-myc gene remains subjected. This interpretation is also supported by the finding that the expression of the c-myc genes of lymphoblastoid cells and of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells are repressed when they are transferred into a mouse plasmacytoma background. The ability of the translocated c-myc oncogene to escape the normal transcriptional control occurring in B cells may be important for the expression of B cell neoplasia in mouse and man. We have also transferred the Burkitt 14q+ chromosome carrying a translocated c-myc oncogene into mouse LM-TK- fibroblasts and studied the levels of human c-myc transcripts in the hybrids.

Although the carboxyl terminus of gp52 is encoded by sequences highly related to sequences in its putative parent, ecotropic Friend murine leukemia virus, the majority of the protein (69%), including the amino terminus, is encoded by dualtropic virus-like sequences. Nucleotide sequence comparisons suggest that the nonecotropic region may be more closely related to the 5' substitution in dualtropic mink cell focus-inducing viruses that it is to the 5' end of xenotropic virus env genes. A large deletion and two unique insertions have been located in the env gene of polycythemia-inducing SFFV and may account for some of the unusual structural characteristics, aberrant processing, and pathogenic properties of gp52. As a consequence of the deletion, amino-terminal gp70 and carboxyl-terminal p15E-encoding sequences are juxtaposed and it appears that translation from the p15E region, 3' to the deletion, continues in the standard reading frame used by other retroviruses.

Plasmid p101/101, a derivative of plasmid pBR322 containing the complete Moloney murine sarcoma virus genome, was cut with restriction enzymes and religated so that both the 5' and 3' LTRs were retained and all but about 700 base pairs of the intervening viral sequences were removed. To test this vector, the Escherichia coli gene gpt was cloned into a unique PstI site, between the two LTRs, with guanine and cytosine tailing, a method that can be generalized for insertion of any DNA segment into this vector. When DNA from recombinant plasmids in which the gpt gene was inserted in the same transcriptional polarity as the LTR sequences was transfected onto murine or rat fibroblast cultures, we obtained a high yield of Gpt(+) colonies. However, plasmid constructs with the gpt gene in the opposite polarity were virtually devoid of activity. With gpt in the proper orientation, restriction enzyme cuts within the LTRs or between the 5' LTR and the gpt gene reduced transfection by more than 98%, whereas a cut between the gpt gene and the 3' LTR gave an 80% reduction in activity. Thus, both 5' and 3' LTR sequences are essential for optimal gpt expression, although the 5' LTR appears to play a more important role. When the LTR-gpt plasmid was transfected onto murine leukemia virus-infected mouse fibroblasts, we obtained evidence that RNA copies became pseudotyped into viral particles which could transfer the Gpt(+) phenotype into rodent cells with extremely high efficiency. This vector should prove useful for high-efficiency transduction of a variety of genes in mammalian cells.",['GM-07367/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC368641,,,,,,,

Mice injected at 2 days and rats injected at 10 days developed multiple brain neoplasms derived from endothelial cells. This conclusion was reinforced by immunofluorescence studies showing factor VIII expression on transformed cells both in vivo and in vitro. Brains of rats injected at 2 days contained both transformed endothelial and astroglial elements. Ultrastructural evidence for murine sarcoma virus replication was found in endothelial and glial cells of animals injected at 2 days; however, such evidence was not found in those injected at 10 days of age.

This inhibiting activity was not destroyed by dialysis, heating at 56 degrees C for 30 min, nor digestion with RNAase or DNAase. About 85% of the inhibiting activity was destroyed by digestion with papain at 37 degrees C for 1 h and it was destroyed completely by heating at 100 degrees C for 30 min. When the heated (56 degrees C for 30 min) soluble fraction of RPMI 8402 cells was mixed with the homogenate of IMR-90 cells, it had no effect on the activities of alkaline, neutral or acid phosphatases, nor of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase or cytochrome c oxidase of IMR-90 cells.

No inhibition of other enzyme activities was observed under similar conditions. These data suggest that the inhibiting activity is due to a protein(s) that is not a protease. The inhibiting activity was found in a single peak after the soluble fraction was fractionated by Sephadex G-100 chromatography and sedimentation centrifugation. The molecular weight of the inhibitor was found to be approx. 35,000 by comparing its retention volume and sedimentation rate with those of proteins of known molecular weight. The present study suggest that the previously reported undetectability of 5'-nucleotidase in permanent cell lines could be due to the presence of a protein inhibitor for 5'-nucleotidase in these human leukemic cell lines. It also supports the hypothesis that the increased 5'-nucleotidase activity in normal senescent cells in vitro may be a control in cellular aging that is missing from leukemic cells in vitro.",,,,,,,,,

It was found that only one of three K562 cell lines was permissive for limited growth of HSV-2 and infectious virus was released in a cyclical fashion. Intranuclear inclusions with electron-dense fibrils and particles resembling viral structures were observed in the virus-infected but not control K562 cells. Viral DNA synthesis could not be detected by centrifugation in CsCl density gradients; but was readily identified by Southern blot hydridization of virus-infected intracellular DNA with purified viral DNA. Viral DNa polymerase was synthesized by infected cells during active infectious virus production. In one of the two K562 cell lines that did not produce infectious virus, a few DNA fragments from infected cells were found to hybridize with purified viral DNA. These results suggest that variable lengths of HSV-2 genome can be harbored and propagated by different human leukemic K562 cells.",,,,,,,,,

Measurement of the apparent overall concentrations of [3H]dTTP produced during incorporation of [3H]thymidine and of [3H]dTMP were so low as to suggest that these precursors were channelled into DNA by the operation of a kinetically linked complex of precursor-synthesizing enzymes and of DNA polymerase.

While half of the untreated patients had increased numbers of MPO-deficient PMN in the blood, all patients in complete remission had normal MPO activity (P = 0.0002).

The Bmax of 0.24 +/- 0.07 nM extrapolates to 15 000 +/- 4000 sites/cell.

At present it seems most likely that the function required for oncogenicity is the transcription promoter contained in the U3 region. Assays designed to measure promoter activity of endogenous and exogenous LTRs show a 10 fold difference between the two. This result is consistent with the notion that RAV-0 is non-oncogenic because its promoter activity falls below the limit required for oncogene activation.

Methylation by sequence-specific bacterial DNA methylases has been shown to suppress the expression of some genes, but not others.

This treatment reduced the biological activity of Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MuLV) proviral DNA by more than three orders of magnitude, whereas complete methylation of 35 HpaII sites in the same DNA had only a marginal effect. The rat methylase-induced inactivation was reversible, as treatment of recipient cells with 5-azacytidine rendered the non-infectious viral genomes biologically active. This suggests that methylation in other C-G dinucleotides than those detectable with restriction enzymes can be crucial for gene expression.",,,,,,,,,

HL60 cells were also forced to differentiate along the myeloid series with retinoic acid (RA) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The striking morphologic changes and the expression of differentiated markers on the induced cells (whether macrophage- or granulocyte-like) were always associated with an acquired or dramatically increased ability to stimulate proliferation and natural killer cell (NK) activity in human lymphocytes. Like HL60 cells after granulocytic differentiation, granulocytes freshly separated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors were also strong inducers of mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) responses. Analysis of the expression of HLA-DR antigens on the surface of undifferentiated and mature cells with two monoclonal antibodies directed against HLA-DR monomorphic determinants, indicated that 1) upon differentiation induced with RA, DMSO, and TPA the cells never acquired surface DR antigens, and 2) normal peripheral blood granulocytes lacked these antigens. In contrast, treatment with LCM always resulted in the expression of high levels of DR antigens on the differentiated macrophage-like cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that all mature myelomonocytic cells, either freshly separated from peripheral blood or obtained after forced in vitro differentiation of leukemic cells, express MLR stimulatory antigens that appear to be unrelated to DR determinants. The possibilities discussed are that such antigens are associated with other molecules encoded by the D region or with new surface structures unrelated to Ia but dependent on the stage of differentiation.","['NS 11036/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05540/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

We report here a series of 107 patients with acute leukemia grafted at the Royal Marsden Hospital in which only 11 (10.3%) developed IPn and only 5 died (5%). Only one case of idiopathic IPn was seen. Factors which may account for this low incidence are discussed. Sixty of 107 patients were transplanted in first remission of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and were therefore in good general condition. Lung radiation doses were carefully monitored and doses of 10.5 Gy were not exceeded except in a group of 16 patients in whom a study of escalating doses of TBI (up to 13 Gy) was undertaken. The dose rate used for total body irradiation (TBI) was lower than that used in other centers and as demonstrated elsewhere by ourselves and others, reduction of dose rate to less than 0.05 Gy/min may be expected to lead to substantial reduction in lung damage. Threshold doses of approximately 8 Gy for IPn have been reported, but within the dose range of 8 to 10.5 Gy we suggest that dose rate may significantly affect the incidence. Data so far available suggest a true improvement in therapeutic ratio for low dose rate single fraction TBI compared with high dose rate.",,,,,,,,,

FeLV particles produced by the viral infected cells are also sensitive to neutralization by anti-HLA antibodies, suggesting that enveloped viral particles incorporated MHC antigens in the viral envelope. The amount of HLA antigens expressed in the viral enveloped, closely reflects the expression of HLA antigens by the virus-producer lymphoid cells. FeLV-infected HsB-2 (T) and SB (B) lymphoid cells cultured under high cell concentration condition show decreased expression of some HLA antigens (A2, B12, B17), and the viral particles produced by those cells also incorporate lower amounts of such antigens. Our results, based on the findings that human lymphoid cells (uninfected, as well as FeLV infected) show decreased expression of some HLA membrane determinants when grown under high cell density conditions, indicate that no viral selective mechanism operates in the incorporation of HLA determinants by enveloped viruses. Instead, our results suggest that viruses pick up MHC antigens from the host cell membrane according to the concentration of those antigens on the surface of the cells at the time of virus budding.","['CA-13885/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

Unlike cells producing ecotropic murine viruses, murine cell lines actively producing either an endogenous xenotropic virus or an amphotropic virus showed a significant degree of receptor activity for Rauscher murine leukemia virus gp70. When murine cells were induced with iododeoxyuridine to produce a xenotropic virus and an ecotropic virus in distinct phases, the receptor activity of the induced cells remained unchanged during xenotropic virus release, but a dramatic decrease was evident with the onset of ecotropic virus release.

Although ecotropic viruses were considered in the past to be the causative agents, envelope gene recombinant (RM) types of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) seem to be the best candidates at present. The following factors are relevant in the murine model: Pure ecotropic MuLV causes disease but induces RM-MuLV de novo in every case. RM-MuLV can cause disease in pure form. However, the mere presence of RM-MuLV may not be sufficient to cause disease in some cases. Ecotropic MuLV is needed under natural conditions for inducing T-cell blastogenesis, donating its coat to recombinant MuLV, and to become a partial parent for RM-MuLV. Early elimination of ecotropic MuLV can prevent disease. In a number of virus-free mouse lymphomas, the only indicator of virus involvement was on RM-MuLV glycoprotein on cell surface. Based on the above, a signal hypothesis model is proposed which attempts to integrate the above observations.",,,,,,,,,

The growth factors for each cell lineage are a subject of intense study. Continuous mouse bone marrow cultures infected with RNA type C viruses (retroviruses) produce nonadherent hematopoietic cells over a longer duration than control cultures. Marrow cultures derived from strains with spontaneously induced ecotropic endogenous retrovirus demonstrate a greater longevity than those from strains with no replicating virus. Cultures infected with murine leukemia virus also generate a greater number, compared with controls, of cloned permanent suspension cell lines dependent for growth on a 41,000-dalton glycoprotein (interleukin 3 [IL 3]). Some are multipotential with capacity for differentiation to erythroid, neutrophil, eosinophil, and basophil/mast cell types. Other cloned IL 3-dependent cell lines are committed to a single pathway. Studies with Friend spleen focus-forming virus indicate that the first effect in the marrow culture is mediated through a subset of adherent hematopoietic stem cells. Bone marrow culture-derived IL 3-dependent cell lines provide a model with which to study the role of viral genes in the control of differentiation and self-renewal capacity of hematopoietic stem cells.",,,,,,,,,

Restriction and sequence analyses reveal that the LTR is located upstream from the erbB coding region and is oriented in the same transcriptional direction; such a structure would be compatible with the promoter-insertion type of activation. Our findings provide a molecular explanation for the multipotency of slowly oncogenic retroviruses.",['CA33158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,"['GENBANK/J00807', 'GENBANK/L00139', 'GENBANK/N00024']",,,,

We constructed a plasmid vector that allows expression of a portion of the coding region for v-myb in a procaryotic host.

The activities of TdT, ADA, PNP and 5'NT in Thy-ALL closely resembled those in normal immature thymocytes, and in the chronic T cell leukaemias showed a similar pattern of enzyme activities to that of mature T lymphocytes. These findings are consistent with surface phenotypic studies of T cell malignancies which suggest that different T cell leukaemias represent malignant proliferation of T cell clones arrested at different stages of T cell differentiation.

Seven antibodies reacted with envelope protein antigens of certain nonecotropic viruses only. Nine antibodies reacted with both ecotropic and nonecotropic viruses.

These data strongly indicate that lambda B3 represents a novel functional IFN-beta gene.

The amino acid sequence of the putative abl gene, when compared with the sequences of other tyrosine-specific protein kinases (src, fes, fps, and yes), revealed significant homologies, indicating that all these functionally related transforming genes are derived from divergent members of the same protooncogene family. In addition to the gag-abl sequence, the proviral genome was found to contain an additional open reading frame that could code for an 18,000-dalton protein, whose role is at present undetermined.",,PMC394102,,,['GENBANK/J02009'],,,,

(1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79, 2031-2035]. The provirus of ATLV integrated in DNA of leukemia T cells from a patient with ATL was molecularly cloned and the complete nucleotide sequence of 9,032 bases of the proviral genome was determined. The provirus DNA contains two long terminal repeats (LTRs) consisting of 755 bases, one at each end, which are flanked by a 6-base direct repeat of the cellular DNA sequence. The nucleotides in the LTR could be arranged into a unique secondary structure, which could explain transcriptional termination within the 3' LTR but not in the 5' LTR. The nucleotide sequence of the provirus contains three large open reading frames, which are capable of coding for proteins of 48,000, 99,000, and 54,000 daltons. The three open frames are in this order from the 5' end of the viral genome and the predicted 48,000-dalton polypeptide is a precursor of gag proteins, because it has an identical amino acid sequence to that of the NH2 terminus of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) p24. The open frames coding for 99,000- and 54,000-dalton polypeptides are thought to be the pol and env genes, respectively. On the 3' side of these three open frames, the ATLV sequence has four smaller open frames in various phases; these frames may code for 10,000-, 11,000-, 12,000-, and 27,000-dalton polypeptides. Although one or some of these open frames could be the transforming gene of this virus, in preliminary analysis, DNA of this region has no homology with the normal human genome.",,PMC394101,,,['GENBANK/J02029'],,,,

The transformation-specific sequence, v-myc, is expressed as part of a fusion protein that contains the viral structural protein p19. By use of monoclonal antibodies against p19 we showed that the v-myc-encoded protein is located in the nucleus of MC29-transformed fibroblasts and that after purification over an immunoaffinity column the protein binds to double-stranded DNA. In this report we describe the analysis of the v-myc gene product from MC29-transformed bone marrow cells. The immunoaffinity column-purified protein from these cells also bound to DNA and was indistinguishable from the purified protein from MC29-transformed fibroblasts. In addition, the v-myc gene products from fibroblasts transformed by three nonconditional mutants of MC29--which transform hematopoietic cells with a markedly decreased efficiency in vivo and in vitro but still transform fibroblasts in vitro, expressing deleted v-myc proteins--were analyzed. In contrast to the wild-type protein, the purified mutant proteins had decreased DNA-binding abilities. Furthermore, a preferential binding of the wild-type protein to poly(dG) . poly(dC) duplexes was observed. Such a specificity was lost with a mutant protein. These results provide evidence that the interaction of the v-myc protein with DNA may be directly involved in transformation of the hematopoietic target cells. Further, the transformation-specific fusion proteins purified from cells transformed by avian erythroblastosis virus, which belongs to a different class of acute leukemia viruses, and by Fujinami sarcoma virus were found not to be DNA-binding proteins, suggesting the existence of different transformation mechanisms.",,PMC393932,,,,,,,

Lymphoid cells infected by Abelson murine leukemia virus exhibit a wide range of growth potential in vitro and in vivo. Uncloned populations that are poorly oncogenic early after infection become progressively more oncogenic with successive passages of the cells in culture. In such mass cultures, it is difficult to evaluate whether a rare subpopulation of highly oncogenic cells becomes dominant in the culture or whether the individual cells progress in oncogenic phenotype. To examine this latter possibility, Abelson virus-infected lymphoid cells were cloned by limiting-dilution culture 10 days postinfection. We isolated two clones that grew poorly in agar, required feeder layers of adherent bone marrow cells for growth in liquid culture, and were extremely slow to form tumors in syngeneic animals. Both clones, after passage in the presence of adherent feeder layers for 3 months, grew well in liquid and agar-containing cultures in the absence of feeder layers and formed tumors in animals at a rapid rate. The progression of these clonal cell lines to a more malignant growth phenotype occurred in the absence of detectable changes in the concentration, half-life, phosphorylation, in vitro kinase activity, or cell localization of the Abelson virus-encoded transforming protein. No change in the concentration or arrangement of integrated Abelson viral DNA sequences was detected in either clone.

In vivo leukemogenicity and the efficiency of in vitro transformation of hematopoietic cells by A-MuLV are known to be affected by the replication competent helper virus present in A-MuLV stocks. The helper virus isolated from the regressing strain of Friend virus (RF-MuLV) is responsible for the spontaneous regression of erythroleukemia induced by replication defective spleen-focus forming virus and itself induces a lymphocytic leukemia which spontaneously regresses. The diseases produced by A-MuLV stocks containing either RF-MuLV or Moloney leukemia virus, the helper virus associated with the original isolate of A-MuLV, were compared to determine if RF-MuLV can influence the disease produced by a replication defective virus with a discrete transforming gene. Both virus stocks induced leukemias with similar efficiency and gross pathology. Spontaneous regression was not observed when RF-MuLV was used as the helper virus. Examination of the leukemic cells and cell lines derived from leukemic tissues indicated that the target cell for A-MuLV transformation was not affected by the helper virus. Both transformed lymphoid and monocytic cells were cultured from leukemic tissues and established as cell lines. The lymphoid cells were phenotypically similar to pre-B cells or null cells, while the monocytic cell lines resemble promonocytes. The frequency with which promonocytic cell lines were isolated from leukemic mice suggests that A-MuLV leukemogenesis may often involve transformation of monocytic series cells as well as lymphoid cells. Thus, RF-MuLV can serve as an efficient helper virus for A-MuLV and does not appear to alter the in vivo target cell for transformation. It is unable, however, to alter the progressive course of Abelson virus induced disease.","['CA-14100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25234/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

In the present report, ST-FeSV was demonstrated to transform murine hematopoietic cells under in vitro assay conditions which detect lymphoid cell transformation by Abelson murine leukemia virus. Bone marrow colony formation was shown to require ST-FeSV, follow single-hit kinetics, and require the presence of mercaptoethanol in the agar medium. ST-FeSV-induced colonies could be established in culture as continuous cell lines that demonstrated unrestricted self-renewal capacity and leukemogenicity in vivo. The hematopoietic blast cells transformed by ST-FeSV in culture appeared to be at an early stage of B cell differentiation. They possessed Lyb 2 surface antigens, were dependent on mercaptoethanol for growth, and contained only low levels of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Moreover, a large fraction of the lines synthesized immunoglobulin mu chain in the absence of light chains. Thus, the phenotype of ST-FeSV hematopoietic transformants was indistinguishable from that of the pre-B lymphoblast transformants induced by Abelson murine leukemia virus.

These homologies were located within the substituted (presumably xenotropic) portion of the mink cell focus-forming virus envelope gene and comprised amino acid sequences not present in three ecotropic virus gp70s. In addition, areas of insertions and deletions, in general, were the same between GA-FeLV-B and Moloney mink cell focus-forming virus, although the sizes of the insertions and deletions differed. Homologies between GA-FeLV-B and mink cell focus-forming virus gp70s is functionally significant in that they both possess expanded host ranges, a property dictated by gp70. The amino acid sequence of FeLV-B contains 12 Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequences, indicating 12 possible sites of N-linked glycosylation as compared with 7 or 8 for its murine counterparts. Comparison of the 3' LTR of GA-FeLV-B to AKR and Moloney virus LTRs revealed extensive conservation in several regions including the ""CCAAT"" and Goldberg-Hogness (TATA) boxes thought to be involved in promotion of transcription and in the repeat region of the LTR.

Restriction endonuclease mapping of four different clones indicates that there are a number of similarities among them, notably the presence of a 6.0- to 6.4-kilobase pair (kbp) EcoRI hybridizing fragment containing portions of sequences homologous to the gag, pol, env, and long terminal repeat-like elements of the infectious FeLV. The endogenous FeLV sequences isolated are approximately 4 kbp in length and are significantly shorter than the cloned infectious FeLV isolates, which are 8.5 to 8.7 kbp in length. The endogenous elements have 3.3- to 3.6-kbp deletions in the gag-pol region and approximately 0.7- to 1.0-kbp deletions in the env region. These deletions would render them incapable of encoding an infectious virus and may therefore be related to the non-inducibility of FeLV from uninfected cat cells and the subgenomic expression of these endogenous sequences in placental tissue. It appears that there is conservation in the ordering of restriction sites previously reported in the proviruses of the infectious FeLVs in sequences corresponding to the pol and env boundary as well as the region spanning the env gene of the endogenous clones, whereas a greater divergence occurs among restriction sites mapped to the gag and part of the pol regions of the infectious FeLV.

The delipidated preparation, after removal of the detergent, showed little, if any, ligand binding to the receptor as measured with the beta-adrenergic antagonist [125I] iodocyanopindolol. Readdition of soybean lipids restored specific radioligand binding. The lipid reconstituted receptor demonstrated agonist and antagonist binding affinities which were not very different from those of the native receptor. The receptor also retained its ability to function, as demonstrated by transfer to a foreign adenylate cyclase system. The delipidated receptor preparation lent itself conveniently to study the requirement for specific lipids in restoration of agonist and antagonist binding. Phosphatidylethanolamine restored maximal binding. Acidic phospholipids and sphingomyelin were inefficient in reconstitution of the receptor. The effect of cholesterol addition was also investigated. Binding was dramatically increased when a cholesterol ester was added in mixture with the acidic phospholipids, cardiolipin or phosphatidylinositol. Further studies unexpectedly revealed that reconstitution of the delipidated receptor is not exclusively dependent on the addition of a phospholipid; a mixture of 1-monooleylglycerol with cholesteryl hemisuccinate restored binding as efficiently as phosphatidylethanolamine.

Gene(s) within the major histocompatibility complex (H-2) influence virus titers, lymphoma incidence, lymphoma type and the anti-MuLV envelope antibody response. In this paper, we report that the prevalence of cytotoxic antibodies to virus-induced lymphomas is also regulated by the H-2 complex. Milk transmission of MuLV resulted in the formation of cytotoxic antibodies against primary virus-induced C57BL lymphomas. These antibodies detect an antigen that is also present on the RADAI tumor-cell line, and on normal spleen cells of young adult B10.A (H-2a) mice of both V+ and V- sublines, but not on spleen cells of young adult B10 (H-2a) mice of either subline. These cytotoxic antibodies were detected in the sera of B10V+ and B10.A(5R)V+ animals, but not in the sera of B10.AV+ mice. This indicates that the prevalence of these antibodies is controlled by a gene in the K- and/or I-A region of the H-2 complex. The presence of these cytotoxic antibodies in serum is recessively inherited. The specificity of the cytotoxic antibodies was investigated with a standard panel of transplantable tumor-cell lines. Of these, only the RADAI cells expressed the target antigen in direct cytotoxicity tests and by absorption. The ability of B10V+ sera to lyse the B10.AV+ and RADAI tumor cells is ascribed to antibody activity against a new MuLV-related cell-surface protein: G(B10.A). Immunochemical analysis and absorption experiments with different types of purified MuLV and MuLV-infected cell lines indicate that the cytotoxic antibodies belong to low-avidity IgM antibodies that are directed to MuLV.",,,,,,,,,

Most lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) of normal origin had only a low percentage of positive cells, not significantly above background, although a few had up to 30% positives. EBV conversion of the EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma line Ramos destabilized the high BLA expression, leading to a decrease in the average number of positive cells in the majority of the converted sublines in parallel with considerable fluctuation in antigen expression within each subline. Our group has previously shown that EBV-conversion of Ramos cells can induce certain differentiation steps (Spira et al., 1981 a). EBV-converted sublines of another EBV-negative Burkitt lymphoma, BJAB, showed a much greater stability previously and remained unchanged with regard to BLA expression in our present experiments. Eight T-cell leukemias, three myeloid leukemia lines and two diffuse histiocytic lymphomas were negative for BLA, whereas two myeloma lines were 30-40% positive. A histiocytic tumor had marginal reactions. Hybrids derived from the fusion of high with low BLA-reactive parental lines showed all three possible patterns (high, intermediate and low), provided that B-cell lines were fused with each other. Fusion of two Burkitt lymphoma lines with the K562 erythroleukemia line led to the extinction of BLA expression, as well as to the eclipse of other B-cell markers. B-lymphoma and leukemia (CLL) cells harvested directly from the patient showed a heterogeneous reactivity pattern. Strong to intermediate BLA expression was found among CLL cells and in most histological groups of B-CLL lymphomas except the centroblastic group (3/3 negatives). IgG-expressing follicular lymphomas were less reactive than IgM +/- IgD lymphomas of the same group. Immunocytomas were also low-reactive. BLA can be thus expressed on a variety of B-cell neoplasms; the degree of its expression appears to be related to the stage of differentiation.",['1 RO1 CA30264-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Exposure of cells previously transformed by the polyoma virus mutant ts-a, which codes for a temperature sensitive T antigen, to a non-toxic dose of BP (0.25 micrograms/ml) enhanced the production of free polyoma DNA at the population level. This occurred at 33 degrees C (the permissive temperature) but not at 39 degrees C, indicating that the BP effect was dependent on the function of the T antigen of polyoma virus. In the same cell system, BP did not induce the production of extrachromosomal copies of two endogenous rat retrovirus genomes, the 30S RNA virus and rat leukemia virus. Thus, the effects on integrated polyoma DNA are quite specific and do not reflect a generalized increase in asynchronous DNA replication and excision. Further studies utilizing a carcinogenic metabolite of BP, benzo[a]pyrene trans-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (anti) (BPDE), on a rat cell line transformed by wild type (WT) polyoma virus demonstrate that the enhancement of polyoma DNA synthesis persists for at least 5 days after a single exposure to BPDE, despite the rapid decay of this compound. In addition, enhanced synthesis of polyoma DNA can be induced by fusion of normal rat fibroblasts previously exposed to BPDE with polyoma transformed rat fibroblasts not exposed to BPDE. It appears, therefore, that the effects we have observed are not due solely to direct carcinogen damage at the level of the integrated polyoma virus DNA, but may instead involve the induction of cellular factor(s) that act indirectly to enhance asynchronous replication of polyoma DNA.","['CA 02111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 07088/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,

Comparison of the subpopulations revealed possible small differences, but none great enough to be of diagnostic value for individual patients. Thus, in a number of cases of practical interest, EPR-determined serum copper levels were essentially redundant with respect to AA measurements. Previous reports recommending the use and possible superiority of EPR for serum copper determinations appear not to have compared the EPR and AA techniques adequately or correctly. EPR serum copper measurements may yet provide unique data in these diseases, but a more detailed analysis of the spectral parameters will be required.

A 32P-labeled complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized by reverse transcription of the TL-specific messenger RNA as template. Analysis of reassociation kinetics of the 32P-TL-cDNA with DNA from ASL-1 cells showed that the kinetics was indistinguishable from that obtained using a DNA encoding a single-copy gene (C mu). An analysis was performed in which DNA from ASL-1 cells was subjected to digestion with each of three restriction enzymes and hybridized with 32P-TL-cDNA according to the Southern ""blot"" technique.

Liposomes conjugated to monoclonal anti-human glycophorin A bind to human erythrocytes in 80-fold greater amounts than liposomes conjugated to a non-specific monoclonal antibody. Binding is inhibited by soluble anti-glycophorin but not by its Fab fragment. In contrast, binding of antibody-conjugated liposomes to K562 cells is very high irrespective of the specificity of the antibody. Liposomes conjugated to a nonspecific monoclonal antibody interact with K562 cells via an Fc receptor, and binding is inhibited by soluble human IgG. Liposomes conjugated to anti-human glycophorin A interact with K562 cells via an Fc receptor and glycophorin A. Binding is not inhibited by either human IgG or anti-glycophorin Fab alone. Binding is only partially inhibited by anti-glycophorin, or by human IgG in the presence of anti-glycophorin Fab, and completely inhibited only by human IgG in the presence of anti-glycophorin. Simultaneous binding of targeted liposomes to two cell membrane antigens is therefore partially resistant to inhibition by single soluble ligands even when they are present in large excess.

Adenosine kinase purified from rabbit liver phosphorylated c9Ado with a Km of 200 microM and a Vmax of 8% that for adenosine. The metabolic buildup of c9ATP in lymphocytes was accompanied by a large, time-dependent decrease in cellular ATP and by smaller percentage decreases in CTP, UTP and GTP. Among other biochemical effects examined, c9Ado was found to cause a decrease in lymphocyte cAMP content and appeared to be neither an inhibitor nor a substrate for S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. Consistent with this latter result, L-homocysteine thiolactone had no effect on the inhibition of LMC by c9Ado. Neither the inhibition of LMC by c9Ado nor the metabolic formation of c9ATP in lymphocytes was affected by erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA), indicating that c9Ado is not a substrate for adenosine deaminase. 5-Iodotubercidin, a non-competitive inhibitor (Kis = 9 nM, Ku = 20 nM) of adenosine kinase, prevented the above effects of c9Ado on lymphocyte function, c9ATP formation, and ATP levels. Either complete preservation (with coformycin) or partial replenishment (with adenosine plus EHNA) of ATP levels in c9Ado-treated lymphocytes resulted in partial restoration of cytolytic function to cells containing large amounts of c9ATP. These results suggest that c9Ado is inhibitory to LMC both because it causes a decrease in the absolute concentration of ATP within the cytolytic lymphocytes and because it permits the establishment within these cells of an unfavorable c9ATP:ATP ratio which impedes the utilization of ATP in a reaction essential to the execution of this lymphocyte function.",['24634/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,

Of 473 live calves entering the study at birth, 54 became infected during the course of the study. Rates of detection of bovine leukemia virus infection were examined using survival methods. Plotted cumulative hazard rates revealed a nonlogarithmic survivorship function and three age-specific detection phases. These phases were 0-6 months, 7-16 months, and 17-26 months of age with estimated incidence rates of 5.25, 2.14, and 14.37 new detections per 10,000 cattle-days at risk, respectively. Significant differences were found between incidence rates of the first and second phase (p = 0.0168) and between those of the second and third phase (p less than 0.0001); corresponding relative risks were 0.41 and 6.71, respectively. The reduced incidence rate of the second phase coincided with movement of calves from a crowded calf barn to pastures. The increased incidence rate of the third phase coincided with mixing of bred heifers with bovine leukemia virus-infected dry cows. Increased incidence rates did not coincide with common-needle vaccination or artificial insemination. Evidence was not found for milk-borne infection. Age-specific detection rates were not associated with dam parity (p = 0.93), dam age (p = 0.79), breed (p = 0.60), or consumption of colostrum from cows infected with the virus (p = 0.23). However, detection rates were lower in cattle born to bovine leukemia virus-infected cows than in those born to noninfected cows (p = 0.03).",,,,,,,,,

The distribution of ADA isoenzymes depends on a binding protein. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.1. - PNP) catabolizes inosine and guanosine to hypoxanthine and guanine. Patients with severe combined immuno-insufficiency often suffer from a congenital ADA deficiency. The PNP deficiency is associated with severely defective T-cell immunity and normal B-cell immunity. Deficiency of ADA leads to an accumulation of adenosine, deoxyadenosine, adenine nucleotides (cAMP, dATP). In PNP deficiency an increased production of inosine, guanosine, deoxyinosine and deoxyguanosine was found. The pathogenesis of the immuno-insufficiency is to be traced back to disturbances in the purine metabolism interfering with the mitogenically induced lymphocyte transformation and other lymphocyte functions, as determined by in vitro tests. Deoxyadenine inhibits the ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase and synthesis of DNA. The overproduction of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine inhibits methyltransferase reactions and 2'-deoxyadenosine the S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. A decrease of ADA activities was found in T-lymphocytes of patients with Hodgkin's disease. Measurements of ADA activity in patients with leukemias do not explain the impairment of the cellular immune response in leukemias and may be regarded as indicator of increased purine metabolism. The ADA activities are increased in patients with acute immature and chronic myeloic leukemias depending on the activity of the disease. The ADA activity is low in chronic lymphatic leukemia. ADA inhibitors were used for the treatment of T-cell leukemias.",,,Immuninsuffizienz durch Enzymdefekte des Purinstoffwechsels.,,,,,,

The nonproducer 6m2 cell clone transformed by ts110 produces an 85,000-Da gag-mos protein (P85gag-mos) and a 58,000-Da gag protein (P58gag). A spontaneous revertant (clone 54-5A4) of the 6m2 cell clone produces a 100,000-Da protein (P100) recognized by antisera raised against murine leukemia virus p15, p12, and p30 but lacks determinants of p10, reverse transcriptase, and gp70. P100 was specifically recognized by antisera (anti-C3) prepared against a synthetic peptide representing the predicted C-terminal 12 amino acids of Moloney MuSV v-mos gene. Normal sera or anti-C3 blocked with excess synthetic peptide did not recognize P100. Thus, P100 is a product of the gag and mos genes. P100 was found to be phosphorylated. A second wild-type revertant (clone 204-3) was obtained by superinfection of ts110 nonproducer cells with Simian sarcoma associated virus (SSAV); it was also found to contain a phosphorylated P100gag-mos protein. The 204-3 cell clone also contained two gag polyproteins (Pr60gag and Pr55gag) of the size and antigenic properties of those found in SSAV-infected cells. These results provide two examples of P100 gag-mos proteins both derived from the P85gag-mos producing 6m2 cell clone. The P100 gag-mos polyproteins are made in amounts that are easily detected by radiolabeling experiments using [3H]leucine. The intracellular viral RNAs present in 6m2 cells and the two revertant clones were also examined. All three cell clones contained a 4.0 kb RNA hybridizing to v-mos sequences but only the 6m2 clone contained a 3.5 kb mos-containing RNA. Our findings indicate that the 3.5 kb RNA codes for P85gag-mos in cell-free translation experiments (Junghans et al., 1982, J. Mol. Biol. 161, 229).

The proviral DNAs are conserved within the revertant lines and have not undergone changes in integration sites due to translocations or other genomic rearrangements. In contrast, expression of well-defined viral-encoded transforming proteins is blocked and elevated levels of phosphotyrosine characteristic of the parental transformed cells are reduced to control levels. Loss of the transformed phenotype is associated with increased cytosine methylation of proviral DNA sequences while levels of methylation resume control levels upon spontaneous retransformation of revertant clones. Following molecular cloning, and transfection to Rat-2 cells, ST-FeSV proviral DNAs from revertant and transformed cells induced similar numbers of transformed foci. Cytosine methylation sites involved in regulation of expression of the major ST-FeSV encoded transforming protein have been localized within the proviral DNA itself rather than in adjacent cellular flanking sequences. In contrast to the v-fes proviral DNA, c-fes, the cellular homolog of the ST-FeSV acquired transforming sequences, is highly methylated in cytosine residues in both transformed and revertant clones.

Sedimentation analyses revealed the expected 30 and 34 S RNA subunits in the MSV-K complex and a previously undetected 30 S RNA subunit accompanying the 34 S RNA subunit in the MuLV-K complex. Nucleic acid hybridization data indicated that each Kirsten virus 30 S RNA subunit had about 40% sequence homology with the RNA genome of MuLV-G, although these sequences were only partially homologous between the two 30 S subunits. In contrast, the MuLV-K 34 S RNA subunit had 96% sequence homology with the MuLV-G genome, whereas the MSV-K 34 S RNA subunit displayed only 71% sequence homology with the MuLV-G genome. Similar relationships were indicated by oligonucleotide fingerprinting. The oligonucleotide data, taken with published sequence data on the MuLV-G and MuLV-M genomes, enabled us to construct partial sequence maps of the MuLV-K 34 S RNA subunit and the MSV-K 34 and 30 S RNA subunits. The sequence arrangements indicated that (1) the MuLV-K 34 S RNA subunit is a variant of the MuLV-G genome; (2) the MSV-K 34 S RNA subunit is a recombinant molecule, which maintains the length of its leukemia virus parent; and (3) the MSV-K 30 S RNA subunit may have been generated from the MuLV-K 34 S genome by a two-stage process, culminating in the retention of parental sequences only within the U5 and U3 noncoding segments and within several amino-terminal coding segments. Further examination of published retrovirus genome sequences revealed several strategically situated sets of potential recognition signals for transcription and translation and suggested a model for genetic recombination based on mRNA splicing signals and areas of limited sequence homology.

The five endogenous MuLV LTRs contained the regulatory signals thought to be important in viral transcription, such as ""TATAA"" and CCAAT-like boxes. A unique feature in four of the endogenous LTRs was the presence of a highly conserved 190-base-pair (bp) insert bounded by 6-bp direct repeats located 48 bp upstream from the C-C-A-A-T sequence. This segment was absent from LTRs associated with ecotropic, xenotropic, or mink cell focus-forming (MCF) MuLV proviruses.

Southern blots of DNA from tumors that contained 2.4-kilobase or larger myc RNA showed myc hybridization to an EcoRI fragment of about 21 kilobase pairs, similar to the myc band in normal DNA. EcoRI digests of DNA from two tumors that expressed myc RNA of 1.8 kilobases showed an additional smaller myc band, suggesting that the myc gene is rearranged in these plasmacytomas.

Southern blot analysis of these transformed cell genomic DNAs revealed that simple integration of the viral DNA within the retrovirus LTR cannot account for the enhanced transformation of the recombinant virus. A restriction fragment derived from the SVLTR-1 virus which contains an intact LTR was readily identified in a majority of the transformed cell DNAs. These results suggest that the LTR fragment which contains the attachment sites and flanking sequences for the proviral DNA duplex may be insufficient by itself to facilitate correct retrovirus integration and that some other functional element of the LTR is responsible for the increased transformation potential of this virus. We have found that a complete copy of the Harvey murine sarcoma virus LTR linked to well-defined structural genes lacking their own promoters (SV40 early region, thymidine kinase, and G418 resistance) can be effectively used to promote marker gene expression. To determine which element of the LTR served to enhance the biological activity of the recombinant virus described above, we deleted DNA sequences essential for promoter activity within the LTR. SV40 virus stocks reconstructed with this mutated copy of the Harvey murine sarcoma virus LTR still transform mouse cells at an enhanced frequency. We speculate that when the LTR is placed more than 1.5 kilobases from the SV40 early promoter, the cis-acting enhancer element within the LTR can increase the ability of the SV40 promoter to effectively operate when integrated in a murine chromosome. These data are discussed in terms of the apparent cell specificity of viral enhancer elements.","['CA 06446/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30490/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC368541,,,,,,,

The PI-FeSV is defective and needs a helper virus for its replication. The v-onc sequences in the PI-FeSV were found to be related to the v-sis sequences of the simian sarcoma virus (SSV). PI-FeSV nonproducer cells express two viral RNAs, a 6.8-and a 3.3-kilobase RNA. The 6.8-kilobase RNA contains gag, sis, and env sequences but lacks the pol gene. The 3.3-kilobase RNA, on the other hand, contains only env sequences. We have detected one feline leukemia virus-related protein product in these cells, namely, a 76-kilodalton protein which contains determinants of the feline leukemia virus gag proteins p15 and p30. The v-sis sequences in the PI-FeSV have been located near the 5' end of the viral genome. Taken together, these results imply that the p76 protein contains both feline leukemia virus gag and sis sequences and probably is the transforming protein of this virus. In contrast, in SSV the sis sequences are located towards the 3' end of the viral genome, and the sis protein is thought to be expressed via a subgenomic RNA. PI-FeSV and SSV therefore use different schemes to express their onc-related sequences. The v-sis sequences in the PI-FeSV contain restriction sites which reflect the different origin of the v-sis sequences in the PI-FeSV and SSV. The homologous oncogenes of the PI-FeSV and SSV thus were transduced by two different retroviruses, feline leukemia virus and the simian sarcoma-associated virus, apparently from the genomes of different species.","['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC255163,,,,,,,

This virus was isolated during in vitro passage of a partially transformation-defective (td) mutant of MC29 (td10H-MC29) in chicken macrophages. While td10H-MC29 has a reduced ability to transform macrophages in vitro or to induce tumors in vivo, HBI-MC29 transforms macrophages efficiently and induces in vivo a high incidence of lymphoid tumors. Electrophoretic analysis of HBI-MC29 genomic RNA revealed that it has a complexity of 5.7 kilobases, like the RNA of wild-type (wt) MC29, and that it is 0.6 kilobases longer than the 5.1-kilobase RNA of the deletion mutant td10H-MC29. Analysis of the viral RNAs of two clonal isolates of HBI-MC29 by T1 oligonucleotide fingerprinting showed that sequences from the viral transformation-specific region, v-myc, which are deleted in td10H RNA, are present in HBI RNA. Moreover, hybridization of HBI RNA to molecularly cloned subgenomic fragments of wtMC29 proviral DNA, followed by fingerprint analysis of hybridized RNA, showed that the entire v-myc-specific RNA sequences defined previously are present. Hybridization to cloned DNA of the normal chicken locus c-myc shows a close relationship between HBI v-myc RNA and c-myc DNA, especially in the sequences which were deleted from td10H-MC29. T1 oligonucleotide maps of HBI and td10H RNAs were prepared and compared. Total conservation of the oligonucleotide pattern is observed in the overlapping v-myc regions, while the partial structural genes gag and env show some variations, most of which can be directly proven to be due to point mutations or recombination with helper viral RNAs that were analyzed in parallel. Recombination of td10H-MC29 with c-myc, followed by recombinational and mutational changes in the structural genes during passage with helper virus, could be a possible explanation for the origin of HBI.",,PMC255134,,,,,,,

When K-562(S) cells, ""induced"" with butyric acid or hemin, are given low dosages of all three types of IFN, the percent benzidine-positive cells doubles. Treatment with low doses of IFN causes the acceleration and increased production of those Hb types (as shown by Cellogel analysis) that are already synthesized either in untreated or in ""induced"" cultures. These results were confirmed by using pure HulFN-beta, and were abrogated, for HulFN-alpha, in presence of its specific antiserum. In contrast, cultures of K-562 cells treated with either inducer and given more than 10(4) IU/ml of alpha- or beta-IFN show a dose-dependent decrease of hemoglobinization in the absence of cell death. The inhibitory effect was reversible upon removal of IFN and culture reseeding in IFN- and inducer-free medium. The significance of both sets of data is strengthened by the pronounced heterogeneity of K-562S cells with respect to their sensitivity to IFN treatment as evaluated by the establishment of the antiviral state. Apparently, one cell out of two is sensitive to IFN, which suggests that the magnitude of IFN effects described here may be larger than it appears to be from the data taken at face value.",,,,,,,,,

We describe two unrelated children, a 21-mo-old white boy and a 15-mo-old black girl, who presented with the clinical and laboratory findings characteristically seen in juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML). Results of periodic serodiagnostic tests indicated that they likely have persistent infection with EBV. Both had elevated IgG antibody to viral capsid antigen (greater than or equal to 1:320) and antibody to early antigen (1:20-1:40) that have persisted for 3 yr of more. Both patients had EBV-specific suppressor cell activity, decreased natural killer cell activity, and diminished antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. These changes suggest an underlying defect in the immunoregulatory network controlling EBV infection. The patients have shown clinical improvement without treatment. It appears that EBV infections are capable of inducing symptoms similar to those seen in JCML. Careful evaluation for evidence of EBV infection in patients presenting with symptoms compatible with JCML seems warranted.","['AI 17020-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,

Conversely, infection rates were high and unchanged by globulin use among patients who received granulocytes from seropositive donors (7 of 8 recipients versus 6 of 7 controls). The lack of effect of the globulin among patients receiving transfusions of granulocytes from seropositive donors may suggest that the dose of antibody was insufficient or that antibody is ineffective against virus transmitted in granulocytes.
